About Fielding:
Born into an aristocratic family at Sharpham near Glastonbury in Somerset in 1707, Fielding was educated at Eton College, where he established a lifelong friendship with Pitt the Elder. His younger sister, Sarah, was also destined to be a successful writer. After a romantic episode with a young woman that ended in his getting into trouble with the law, he went to London where his literary career began. In 1728, he travelled to Leiden to study classics and law at the University. However, due to lack of money he was obliged to return to London and he began writing for the theatre, some of his work being savagely critical of the contemporary government under Sir Robert Walpole. The Theatrical Licensing Act of 1737 is alleged to be a direct result of his activities. The particular play that triggered the Licensing Act was The Vision of the Golden Rump, but Fielding's satires had set the tone. Once the Licensing Act passed, political satire on the stage was virtually impossible, and playwrights whose works were staged were viewed as suspect. Fielding therefore retired from the theatre and resumed his career in law and, in order to support his wife Charlotte Cradock and two children, he became a barrister. His lack of money sense meant that he and his family often endured periods of poverty, but he was also helped by Ralph Allen, a wealthy benefactor who later formed the basis of Squire Allworthy in Tom Jones. After Fielding's death, Allen provided for the education and support of his children. Fielding never stopped writing political satire and satires of current arts and letters. His Tragedy of Tragedies of Tom Thumb (for which Hogarth designed the frontispiece) was, for example, quite successful as a printed play. He also contributed a number of works to journals of the day. He wrote for Tory periodicals, usually under the name of "Captain Hercules Vinegar". As Justice of the Peace he issued a warrant for the arrest of Colley Cibber for "murder of the English language". During the late 1730s and early 1740s Fielding continued to air his liberal and anti-Jacobite views in satirical articles and newspapers. Almost by accident, in anger at the success of Richardson's Pamela, Fielding took to writing novels in 1741 and his first major success was Shamela, an anonymous parody of Samuel Richardson's melodramatic novel. It is a satire that follows the model of the famous Tory satirists of the previous generation (Jonathan Swift and John Gay, in particular). He followed this up with Joseph Andrews (1742), an original work supposedly dealing with Pamela's brother, Joseph. Although also begun as a parody, this work developed into an accomplished novel in its own right and is considered to mark Fielding's debut as a serious novelist. In 1743,
2
he published a novel in the Miscellanies volume III (which was the first volume of the Miscellanies). This was The History of the Life of the Late Mr Jonathan Wild the Great. This novel is sometimes thought of as his first because he almost certainly began composing it before he wrote Shamela and Joseph Andrews. It is a satire of Walpole that draws a parallel between Walpole and Jonathan Wild, the infamous gang leader and highwayman. He implicitly compares the Whig party in Parliament with a gang of thieves being run by Walpole, whose constant desire to be a "Great Man" (a common epithet for Walpole) should culminate only in the antithesis of greatness: being hanged. His anonymously-published The Female Husband of 1746 is a fictionalized account of a notorious case in which a female transvestite was tried for duping another woman into marriage. Though a minor item in Fielding's total oeuvre, the subject is consistent with his ongoing preoccupation with fraud, sham, and masks. His greatest work was Tom Jones (1749), a meticulously constructed picaresque novel telling the convoluted and hilarious tale of how a foundling came into a fortune. Charlotte, on whom he later modeled the heroines of both Tom Jones and Amelia, died in 1744. Three years later Fielding - disregarding public opinion - married her former maid, Mary, who was pregnant. Despite this, his consistent anti-Jacobism and support for the Church of England led to him being rewarded a year later with the position of London's Chief Magistrate, and his literary career went from strength to strength. Joined by his younger half-brother John, he helped found what some have called London's first police force, the Bow Street Runners in 1749. According to the historian G.M. Trevelyan, they were two of the best magistrates in eighteenth-century London, and did a great deal to enhance the cause of judicial reform and improve prison conditions. His influential pamphlets and enquiries included a proposal for the abolition of public hangings. [1] This did not, however, imply opposition to capital punishment as such一as evident, for example, in his presiding in 1751 over the trial of the notorious criminal James Field, finding him guilty in a robbery and sentencing him to hang. However, Fielding's ardent commitment to the cause of justice as a great humanitarian in the 1750s, coincided with a rapid deterioration in his health to such an extent that he went abroad to Portugal in 1754 in search of a cure. Gout, asthma and other afflictions meant that he had to use crutches. He died in Lisbon two months later and his tomb at the English Church may be visited. Despite being now blind, John Fielding succeeded his older brother as Chief Magistrate and became known as the

To the Honourable
GEORGE LYTTLETON, ESQ;
One of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.
Sir,
Notwithstanding your constant refusal, when I have asked leave to prefix your name to this dedication, I must still insist on my right to desire your protection of this work.
To you, Sir, it is owing that this history was ever begun. It was by your desire that I first thought of such a composition. So many years have since past, that you may have, perhaps, forgotten this circumstance: but your desires are to me in the nature of commands; and the impression of them is never to be erased from my memory.
Again, Sir, without your assistance this history had never been completed. Be not startled at the assertion. I do not intend to draw on you the suspicion of being a romance writer. I mean no more than that I partly owe to you my existence during great part of the time which I have employed in composing it: another matter which it may be necessary to remind you of; since there are certain actions of which you are apt to be extremely forgetful; but of these I hope I shall always have a better memory than yourself.
Lastly, It is owing to you that the history appears what it now is. If there be in this work, as some have been pleased to say, a stronger picture of a truly benevolent mind than is to be found in any other, who that knows you, and a particular acquaintance of yours, will doubt whence that benevolence hath been copied? The world will not, I believe, make me the compliment of thinking I took it from myself. I care not: this they shall own, that the two persons from whom I have taken it, that is to say, two of the best and worthiest men in the world, are strongly and zealously my friends. I might be contented with this, and yet my vanity will add a third to the number; and him one of the greatest and noblest, not only in his rank, but in every public and private virtue. But here, whilst my gratitude for the princely benefactions of the Duke of Bedford bursts from my heart, you must forgive my reminding you that it was you who first recommended me to the notice of my benefactor.
And what are your objections to the allowance of the honour which I have sollicited? Why, you have commended the book so warmly, that you should be ashamed of reading your name before the dedication. Indeed, sir, if the book itself doth not make you ashamed of your
5
commendations, nothing that I can here write will, or ought. I am not to give up my right to your protection and patronage, because you have commended my book: for though I acknowledge so many obligations to you, I do not add this to the number; in which friendship, I am convinced, hath so little share: since that can neither biass your judgment, nor pervert your integrity. An enemy may at any time obtain your commendation by only deserving it; and the utmost which the faults of your friends can hope for, is your silence; or, perhaps, if too severely accused, your gentle palliation.
In short, sir, I suspect, that your dislike of public praise is your true objection to granting my request. I have observed that you have, in common with my two other friends, an unwillingness to hear the least mention of your own virtues; that, as a great poet says of one of you, (he might justly have said it of all three), you
Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame.
If men of this disposition are as careful to shun applause, as others are to escape censure, how just must be your apprehension of your character falling into my hands; since what would not a man have reason to dread, if attacked by an author who had received from him injuries equal to my obligations to you!
And will not this dread of censure increase in proportion to the matter which a man is conscious of having afforded for it? If his whole life, for instance, should have been one continued subject of satire, he may well tremble when an incensed satirist takes him in hand. Now, sir, if we apply this to your modest aversion to panegyric, how reasonable will your fears of me appear!
Yet surely you might have gratified my ambition, from this single confidence, that I shall always prefer the indulgence of your inclinations to the satisfaction of my own. A very strong instance of which I shall give you in this address, in which I am determined to follow the example of all other dedicators, and will consider not what my patron really deserves to have written, but what he will be best pleased to read.
Without further preface then, I here present you with the labours of some years of my life. What merit these labours have is already known to yourself. If, from your favourable judgment, I have conceived some esteem for them, it cannot be imputed to vanity; since I should have agreed as implicitly to your opinion, had it been given in favour of any other man's production. Negatively, at least, I may be allowed to say,
6
that had I been sensible of any great demerit in the work, you are the last person to whose protection I would have ventured to recommend it.
From the name of my patron, indeed, I hope my reader will be convinced, at his very entrance on this work, that he will find in the whole course of it nothing prejudicial to the cause of religion and virtue, nothing inconsistent with the strictest rules of decency, nor which can offend even the chastest eye in the perusal. On the contrary, I declare, that to recommend goodness and innocence hath been my sincere endeavour in this history. This honest purpose you have been pleased to think I have attained: and to say the truth, it is likeliest to be attained in books of this kind; for an example is a kind of picture, in which virtue becomes, as it were, an object of sight, and strikes us with an idea of that loveliness, which Plato asserts there is in her naked charms.
Besides displaying that beauty of virtue which may attract the admiration of mankind, I have attempted to engage a stronger motive to human action in her favour, by convincing men, that their true interest directs them to a pursuit of her. For this purpose I have shown that no acquisitions of guilt can compensate the loss of that solid inward comfort of mind, which is the sure companion of innocence and virtue; nor can in the least balance the evil of that horror and anxiety which, in their room, guilt introduces into our bosoms. And again, that as these acquisitions are in themselves generally worthless, so are the means to attain them not only base and infamous, but at best incertain, and always full of danger. Lastly, I have endeavoured strongly to inculcate, that virtue and innocence can scarce ever be injured but by indiscretion; and that it is this alone which often betrays them into the snares that deceit and villainy spread for them. A moral which I have the more industriously laboured, as the teaching it is, of all others, the likeliest to be attended with success; since, I believe, it is much easier to make good men wise, than to make bad men good.
For these purposes I have employed all the wit and humour of which I am master in the following history; wherein I have endeavoured to laugh mankind out of their favourite follies and vices. How far I have succeeded in this good attempt, I shall submit to the candid reader, with only two requests: First, that he will not expect to find perfection in this work; and Secondly, that he will excuse some parts of it, if they fall short of that little merit which I hope may appear in others.
I will detain you, sir, no longer. Indeed I have run into a preface, while I professed to write a dedication. But how can it be otherwise? I dare not
7
praise you; and the only means I know of to avoid it, when you are in my thoughts, are either to be entirely silent, or to turn my thoughts to some other subject.
Pardon, therefore, what I have said in this epistle, not only without your consent, but absolutely against it; and give me at least leave, in this public manner, to declare that I am, with the highest respect and gratitude,一
Sir,
Your most obliged,
Obedient, humble servant,
HENRY FIELDING.

Chapter 且
The introduction to the work, or bill of fare to the feast.
An author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public ordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the former case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare he pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly disagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any fault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary of this happens to the master of an ordinary. Men who pay for what they eat will insist on gratifying their palates, however nice and whimsical these may prove; and if everything is not agreeable to their taste, will challenge a right to censure, to abuse, and to d一n their dinner without controul.
To prevent, therefore, giving offence to their customers by any such disappointment, it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning host to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their first entrance into the house; and having thence acquainted themselves with the entertainment which they may expect, may either stay and regale with what is provided for them, or may depart to some other ordinary better accommodated to their taste.
As we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from any man who is capable of lending us either, we have condescended to take a hint from these honest victuallers, and shall prefix not only a general bill of fare to our whole entertainment, but shall likewise give the reader particular bills to every course which is to be served up in this and the ensuing volumes.
The provision, then, which we have here made is no other than Human Nature. Nor do I fear that my sensible reader, though most luxurious in his taste, will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named but one article. The tortoise一as the alderman of Bristol, well learned in eating,
10
knows by much experience—besides the delicious calipash and calipee, contains many different kinds of food; nor can the learned reader be ignorant, that in human nature, though here collected under one general name, is such prodigious variety, that a cook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal and vegetable food in the world, than an author will be able to exhaust so extensive a subject.
An objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that this dish is too common and vulgar; for what else is the subject of all the romances, novels, plays, and poems, with which the stalls abound? Many exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure, if it was a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and vulgar, that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under the same name. In reality, true nature is as difficult to be met with in authors, as the Bayonne ham, or Bologna sausage, is to be found in the shops.
But the whole, to continue the same metaphor, consists in the cookery of the author; for, as Mr Pope tells us一
"True wit is nature to advantage drest; What oft was thought, but ne'er so well exprest."
The same animal which hath the honour to have some part of his flesh eaten at the table of a duke, may perhaps be degraded in another part, and some of his limbs gibbeted, as it were, in the vilest stall in town. Where, then, lies the difference between the food of the nobleman and the porter, if both are at dinner on the same ox or calf, but in the seasoning, the dressing, the garnishing, and the setting forth? Hence the one provokes and incites the most languid appetite, and the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest.
In like manner, the excellence of the mental entertainment consists less in the subject than in the author's skill in well dressing it up. How pleased, therefore, will the reader be to find that we have, in the following work, adhered closely to one of the highest principles of the best cook which the present age, or perhaps that of Heliogabalus, hath produced. This great man, as is well known to all lovers of polite eating, begins at first by setting plain things before his hungry guests, rising afterwards by degrees as their stomachs may be supposed to decrease, to the very quintessence of sauce and spices. In like manner, we shall represent human nature at first to the keen appetite of our reader, in that more plain and simple manner in which it is found in the country, and shall hereafter hash and ragoo it with all the high French and Italian seasoning of affectation and vice which courts and cities afford. By these means, we
11
doubt not but our reader may be rendered desirous to read on for ever, as the great person just above-mentioned is supposed to have made some persons eat.
Having premised thus much, we will now detain those who like our bill of fare no longer from their diet, and shall proceed directly to serve up the first course of our history for their entertainment.

Chapter
A short description of squire Allworthy, and a fuller account of Miss Bridget Allworthy, his sister.
In that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly called Somersetshire, there lately lived, and perhaps lives still, a gentleman whose name was Allworthy, and who might well be called the favourite of both nature and fortune; for both of these seem to have contended which should bless and enrich him most. In this contention, nature may seem to some to have come off victorious, as she bestowed on him many gifts, while fortune had only one gift in her power; but in pouring forth this, she was so very profuse, that others perhaps may think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to all the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature. From the former of these, he derived an agreeable person, a sound constitution, a solid understanding, and a benevolent heart; by the latter, he was decreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the county.
This gentleman had in his youth married a very worthy and beautiful woman, of whom he had been extremely fond: by her he had three children, all of whom died in their infancy. He had likewise had the misfortune of burying this beloved wife herself, about five years before the time in which this history chuses to set out. This loss, however great, he bore like a man of sense and constancy, though it must be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this head; for he sometimes said he looked on himself as still married, and considered his wife as only gone a little before him, a journey which he should most certainly, sooner or later, take after her; and that he had not the least doubt of meeting her again in a place where he should never part with her more一sentiments for which his sense was arraigned by one part of his neighbours, his religion by a second, and his sincerity by a third.
He now lived, for the most part, retired in the country, with one sister, for whom he had a very tender affection. This lady was now somewhat past the age of thirty, an aera at which, in the opinion of the malicious,
13
the title of old maid may with no impropriety be assumed. She was of that species of women whom you commend rather for good qualities than beauty, and who are generally called, by their own sex, very good sort of women一as good a sort of woman, madam, as you would wish to know. Indeed, she was so far from regretting want of beauty, that she never mentioned that perfection, if it can be called one, without contempt; and would often thank God she was not as handsome as Miss Such-a-one, whom perhaps beauty had led into errors which she might have otherwise avoided. Miss Bridget Allworthy (for that was the name of this lady) very rightly conceived the charms of person in a woman to be no better than snares for herself, as well as for others; and yet so discreet was she in her conduct, that her prudence was as much on the guard as if she had all the snares to apprehend which were ever laid for her whole sex. Indeed, I have observed, though it may seem unaccountable to the reader, that this guard of prudence, like the trained bands, is always readiest to go on duty where there is the least danger. It often basely and cowardly deserts those paragons for whom the men are all wishing, sighing, dying, and spreading, every net in their power; and constantly attends at the heels of that higher order of women for whom the other sex have a more distant and awful respect, and whom (from despair, I suppose, of success) they never venture to attack.
Reader, I think proper, before we proceed any farther together, to acquaint thee that I intend to digress, through this whole history, as often as I see occasion, of which I am myself a better judge than any pitiful critic whatever; and here I must desire all those critics to mind their own business, and not to intermeddle with affairs or works which no ways concern them; for till they produce the authority by which they are constituted judges, I shall not plead to their jurisdiction.

Chapter U
An odd accident which befel Mr Allworthy at his return home. The decent behaviour of Mrs Deborah Wilkins, with some proper animadversions on bastards.
I have told my reader, in the preceding chapter, that Mr Allworthy inherited a large fortune; that he had a good heart, and no family. Hence, doubtless, it will be concluded by many that he lived like an honest man, owed no one a shilling, took nothing but what was his own, kept a good house, entertained his neighbours with a hearty welcome at his table, and was charitable to the poor, i.e. to those who had rather beg than work, by giving them the offals from it; that he died immensely rich and built an hospital.
And true it is that he did many of these things; but had he done nothing more I should have left him to have recorded his own merit on some fair freestone over the door of that hospital. Matters of a much more extraordinary kind are to be the subject of this history, or I should grossly mis-spend my time in writing so voluminous a work; and you, my sagacious friend, might with equal profit and pleasure travel through some pages which certain droll authors have been facetiously pleased to call The History of England.
Mr Allworthy had been absent a full quarter of a year in London, on some very particular business, though I know not what it was; but judge of its importance by its having detained him so long from home, whence he had not been absent a month at a time during the space of many years. He came to his house very late in the evening, and after a short supper with his sister, retired much fatigued to his chamber. Here, having spent some minutes on his knees一a custom which he never broke through on any account一he was preparing to step into bed, when, upon opening the cloathes, to his great surprize he beheld an infant, wrapt up in some coarse linen, in a sweet and profound sleep, between his sheets. He stood some time lost in astonishment at this sight; but, as good nature had always the ascendant in his mind, he soon began to be
15
touched with sentiments of compassion for the little wretch before him. He then rang his bell, and ordered an elderly woman-servant to rise immediately, and come to him; and in the meantime was so eager in contemplating the beauty of innocence, appearing in those lively colours with which infancy and sleep always display it, that his thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he was in his shirt when the matron came in. She had indeed given her master sufficient time to dress himself; for out of respect to him, and regard to decency, she had spent many minutes in adjusting her hair at the looking-glass, notwithstanding all the hurry in which she had been summoned by the servant, and though her master, for aught she knew, lay expiring in an apoplexy, or in some other fit.
It will not be wondered at that a creature who had so strict a regard to decency in her own person, should be shocked at the least deviation from it in another. She therefore no sooner opened the door, and saw her master standing by the bedside in his shirt, with a candle in his hand, than she started back in a most terrible fright, and might perhaps have swooned away, had he not now recollected his being undrest, and put an end to her terrors by desiring her to stay without the door till he had thrown some cloathes over his back, and was become incapable of shocking the pure eyes of Mrs Deborah Wilkins, who, though in the fifty-second year of her age, vowed she had never beheld a man without his coat. Sneerers and prophane wits may perhaps laugh at her first fright; yet my graver reader, when he considers the time of night, the summons from her bed, and the situation in which she found her master, will highly justify and applaud her conduct, unless the prudence which must be supposed to attend maidens at that period of life at which Mrs Deborah had arrived, should a little lessen his admiration.
When Mrs Deborah returned into the room, and was acquainted by her master with the finding the little infant, her consternation was rather greater than his had been; nor could she refrain from crying out, with great horror of accent as well as look, "My good sir! what's to be done?" Mr Allworthy answered, she must take care of the child that evening, and in the morning he would give orders to provide it a nurse. "Yes, sir," says she; "and I hope your worship will send out your warrant to take up the hussy its mother, for she must be one of the neighbourhood; and I should be glad to see her committed to Bridewell, and whipt at the cart's tail. Indeed, such wicked sluts cannot be too severely punished. I'll warrant 'tis not her first, by her impudence in laying it to your worship." "In laying it to me, Deborah!" answered Allworthy: "I can't think she hath
16
any such design. I suppose she hath only taken this method to provide for her child; and truly I am glad she hath not done worse." "I don't know what is worse," cries Deborah, "than for such wicked strumpets to lay their sins at honest men's doors; and though your worship knows your own innocence, yet the world is censorious; and it hath been many an honest man's hap to pass for the father of children he never begot; and if your worship should provide for the child, it may make the people the apter to believe; besides, why should your worship provide for what the parish is obliged to maintain? For my own part, if it was an honest man's child, indeed—but for my own part, it goes against me to touch these misbegotten wretches, whom I don't look upon as my fellowcreatures. Faugh! how it stinks! It doth not smell like a Christian. If I might be so bold to give my advice, I would have it put in a basket, and sent out and laid at the churchwarden's door. It is a good night, only a little rainy and windy; and if it was well wrapt up, and put in a warm basket, it is two to one but it lives till it is found in the morning. But if it should not, we have discharged our duty in taking proper care of it; and it is, perhaps, better for such creatures to die in a state of innocence, than to grow up and imitate their mothers; for nothing better can be expected of them."
There were some strokes in this speech which perhaps would have offended Mr Allworthy, had he strictly attended to it; but he had now got one of his fingers into the infant's hand, which, by its gentle pressure, seeming to implore his assistance, had certainly out-pleaded the eloquence of Mrs Deborah, had it been ten times greater than it was. He now gave Mrs Deborah positive orders to take the child to her own bed, and to call up a maid-servant to provide it pap, and other things, against it waked. He likewise ordered that proper cloathes should be procured for it early in the morning, and that it should be brought to himself as soon as he was stirring.
Such was the discernment of Mrs Wilkins, and such the respect she bore her master, under whom she enjoyed a most excellent place, that her scruples gave way to his peremptory commands; and she took the child under her arms, without any apparent disgust at the illegality of its birth; and declaring it was a sweet little infant, walked off with it to her own chamber.
Allworthy here betook himself to those pleasing slumbers which a heart that hungers after goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied. As these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any
17
other hearty meal, I should take more pains to display them to the reader, if I knew any air to recommend him to for the procuring such an appetite.
18
The reader's neck brought into danger by a description; his escape; and the great condescension of Miss Bridget Allworthy.
The Gothic stile of building could produce nothing nobler than Mr Allworthy's house. There was an air of grandeur in it that struck you with awe, and rivalled the beauties of the best Grecian architecture; and it was as commodious within as venerable without.
It stood on the south-east side of a hill, but nearer the bottom than the top of it, so as to be sheltered from the north-east by a grove of old oaks which rose above it in a gradual ascent of near half a mile, and yet high enough to enjoy a most charming prospect of the valley beneath.
In the midst of the grove was a fine lawn, sloping down towards the house, near the summit of which rose a plentiful spring, gushing out of a rock covered with firs, and forming a constant cascade of about thirty feet, not carried down a regular flight of steps, but tumbling in a natural fall over the broken and mossy stones till it came to the bottom of the rock, then running off in a pebly channel, that with many lesser falls winded along, till it fell into a lake at the foot of the hill, about a quarter of a mile below the house on the south side, and which was seen from every room in the front. Out of this lake, which filled the center of a beautiful plain, embellished with groups of beeches and elms, and fed with sheep, issued a river, that for several miles was seen to meander through an amazing variety of meadows and woods till it emptied itself into the sea, with a large arm of which, and an island beyond it, the prospect was closed.
On the right of this valley opened another of less extent, adorned with several villages, and terminated by one of the towers of an old ruined abby, grown over with ivy, and part of the front, which remained still entire.
The left-hand scene presented the view of a very fine park, composed of very unequal ground, and agreeably varied with all the diversity that
19
hills, lawns, wood, and water, laid out with admirable taste, but owing less to art than to nature, could give. Beyond this, the country gradually rose into a ridge of wild mountains, the tops of which were above the clouds.
It was now the middle of May, and the morning was remarkably serene, when Mr Allworthy walked forth on the terrace, where the dawn opened every minute that lovely prospect we have before described to his eye; and now having sent forth streams of light, which ascended the blue firmament before him, as harbingers preceding his pomp, in the full blaze of his majesty rose the sun, than which one object alone in this lower creation could be more glorious, and that Mr Allworthy himself presented一a human being replete with benevolence, meditating in what manner he might render himself most acceptable to his Creator, by doing most good to his creatures.
Reader, take care. I have unadvisedly led thee to the top of as high a hill as Mr Allworthy's, and how to get thee down without breaking thy neck, I do not well know. However, let us e'en venture to slide down together; for Miss Bridget rings her bell, and Mr Allworthy is summoned to breakfast, where I must attend, and, if you please, shall be glad of your company.
The usual compliments having past between Mr Allworthy and Miss Bridget, and the tea being poured out, he summoned Mrs Wilkins, and told his sister he had a present for her, for which she thanked him一imagining, I suppose, it had been a gown, or some ornament for her person. Indeed, he very often made her such presents; and she, in complacence to him, spent much time in adorning herself. I say in complacence to him, because she always exprest the greatest contempt for dress, and for those ladies who made it their study.
But if such was her expectation, how was she disappointed when Mrs Wilkins, according to the order she had received from her master, produced the little infant? Great surprizes, as hath been observed, are apt to be silent; and so was Miss Bridget, till her brother began, and told her the whole story, which, as the reader knows it already, we shall not repeat.
Miss Bridget had always exprest so great a regard for what the ladies are pleased to call virtue, and had herself maintained such a severity of character, that it was expected, especially by Wilkins, that she would have vented much bitterness on this occasion, and would have voted for sending the child, as a kind of noxious animal, immediately out of the house; but, on the contrary, she rather took the good-natured side of the
20
question, intimated some compassion for the helpless little creature, and commended her brother's charity in what he had done.
Perhaps the reader may account for this behaviour from her condescension to Mr Allworthy, when we have informed him that the good man had ended his narrative with owning a resolution to take care of the child, and to breed him up as his own; for, to acknowledge the truth, she was always ready to oblige her brother, and very seldom, if ever, contradicted his sentiments. She would, indeed, sometimes make a few observations, as that men were headstrong, and must have their own way, and would wish she had been blest with an independent fortune; but these were always vented in a low voice, and at the most amounted only to what is called muttering.
However, what she withheld from the infant, she bestowed with the utmost profuseness on the poor unknown mother, whom she called an impudent slut, a wanton hussy, an audacious harlot, a wicked jade, a vile strumpet, with every other appellation with which the tongue of virtue never fails to lash those who bring a disgrace on the sex.
A consultation was now entered into how to proceed in order to discover the mother. A scrutiny was first made into the characters of the female servants of the house, who were all acquitted by Mrs Wilkins, and with apparent merit; for she had collected them herself, and perhaps it would be difficult to find such another set of scarecrows.
The next step was to examine among the inhabitants of the parish; and this was referred to Mrs Wilkins, who was to enquire with all imaginable diligence, and to make her report in the afternoon.
Matters being thus settled, Mr Allworthy withdrew to his study, as was his custom, and left the child to his sister, who, at his desire, had undertaken the care of it.

Chapter U
Containing a few common matters, with a very uncommon observation upon them.
When her master was departed, Mrs Deborah stood silent, expecting her cue from Miss Bridget; for as to what had past before her master, the prudent housekeeper by no means relied upon it, as she had often known the sentiments of the lady in her brother's absence to differ greatly from those which she had expressed in his presence. Miss Bridget did not, however, suffer her to continue long in this doubtful situation; for having looked some time earnestly at the child, as it lay asleep in the lap of Mrs Deborah, the good lady could not forbear giving it a hearty kiss, at the same time declaring herself wonderfully pleased with its beauty and innocence. Mrs Deborah no sooner observed this than she fell to squeezing and kissing, with as great raptures as sometimes inspire the sage dame of forty and five towards a youthful and vigorous bridegroom, crying out, in a shrill voice, "O, the dear little creature!一The dear, sweet, pretty creature! Well, I vow it is as fine a boy as ever was seen!"
These exclamations continued till they were interrupted by the lady, who now proceeded to execute the commission given her by her brother, and gave orders for providing all necessaries for the child, appointing a very good room in the house for his nursery. Her orders were indeed so liberal, that, had it been a child of her own, she could not have exceeded them; but, lest the virtuous reader may condemn her for showing too great regard to a base-born infant, to which all charity is condemned by law as irreligious, we think proper to observe that she concluded the whole with saying, "Since it was her brother's whim to adopt the little brat, she supposed little master must be treated with great tenderness. For her part, she could not help thinking it was an encouragement to vice; but that she knew too much of the obstinacy of mankind to oppose any of their ridiculous humours."
22
With reflections of this nature she usually, as has been hinted, accompanied every act of compliance with her brother's inclinations; and surely nothing could more contribute to heighten the merit of this compliance than a declaration that she knew, at the same time, the folly and unreasonableness of those inclinations to which she submitted. Tacit obedience implies no force upon the will, and consequently may be easily, and without any pains, preserved; but when a wife, a child, a relation, or a friend, performs what we desire, with grumbling and reluctance, with expressions of dislike and dissatisfaction, the manifest difficulty which they undergo must greatly enhance the obligation.
As this is one of those deep observations which very few readers can be supposed capable of making themselves, I have thought proper to lend them my assistance; but this is a favour rarely to be expected in the course of my work. Indeed, I shall seldom or never so indulge him, unless in such instances as this, where nothing but the inspiration with which we writers are gifted, can possibly enable any one to make the discovery.

Mrs Deborah is introduced into the parish with a simile. A short account of Jenny Jones, with the difficulties and discouragements which may attend young women in the pursuit of learning.
Mrs Deborah, having disposed of the child according to the will of her master, now prepared to visit those habitations which were supposed to conceal its mother.
Not otherwise than when a kite, tremendous bird, is beheld by the feathered generation soaring aloft, and hovering over their heads, the amorous dove, and every innocent little bird, spread wide the alarm, and fly trembling to their hiding-places. He proudly beats the air, conscious of his dignity, and meditates intended mischief.
So when the approach of Mrs Deborah was proclaimed through the street, all the inhabitants ran trembling into their houses, each matron dreading lest the visit should fall to her lot. She with stately steps proudly advances over the field: aloft she bears her towering head, filled with conceit of her own pre-eminence, and schemes to effect her intended discovery.
The sagacious reader will not from this simile imagine these poor people had any apprehension of the design with which Mrs Wilkins was now coming towards them; but as the great beauty of the simile may possibly sleep these hundred years, till some future commentator shall take this work in hand, I think proper to lend the reader a little assistance in this place.
It is my intention, therefore, to signify, that, as it is the nature of a kite to devour little birds, so is it the nature of such persons as Mrs Wilkins to insult and tyrannize over little people. This being indeed the means which they use to recompense to themselves their extreme servility and condescension to their superiors; for nothing can be more reasonable, than that slaves and flatterers should exact the same taxes on all below them, which they themselves pay to all above them.
24
Whenever Mrs Deborah had occasion to exert any extraordinary condescension to Mrs Bridget, and by that means had a little soured her natural disposition, it was usual with her to walk forth among these people, in order to refine her temper, by venting, and, as it were, purging off all ill humours; on which account she was by no means a welcome visitant: to say the truth, she was universally dreaded and hated by them all.
On her arrival in this place, she went immediately to the habitation of an elderly matron; to whom, as this matron had the good fortune to resemble herself in the comeliness of her person, as well as in her age, she had generally been more favourable than to any of the rest. To this woman she imparted what had happened, and the design upon which she was come thither that morning. These two began presently to scrutinize the characters of the several young girls who lived in any of those houses, and at last fixed their strongest suspicion on one Jenny Jones, who, they both agreed, was the likeliest person to have committed this fact.
This Jenny Jones was no very comely girl, either in her face or person; but nature had somewhat compensated the want of beauty with what is generally more esteemed by those ladies whose judgment is arrived at years of perfect maturity, for she had given her a very uncommon share of understanding. This gift Jenny had a good deal improved by erudition. She had lived several years a servant with a schoolmaster, who, discovering a great quickness of parts in the girl, and an extraordinary desire of learning一for every leisure hour she was always found reading in the books of the scholars一had the good-nature, or folly一just as the reader pleases to call it一to instruct her so far, that she obtained a competent skill in the Latin language, and was, perhaps, as good a scholar as most of the young men of quality of the age. This advantage, however, like most others of an extraordinary kind, was attended with some small inconveniences: for as it is not to be wondered at, that a young woman so well accomplished should have little relish for the society of those whom fortune had made her equals, but whom education had rendered so much her inferiors; so is it matter of no greater astonishment, that this superiority in Jenny, together with that behaviour which is its certain consequence, should produce among the rest some little envy and ill-will towards her; and these had, perhaps, secretly burnt in the bosoms of her neighbours ever since her return from her service.
Their envy did not, however, display itself openly, till poor Jenny, to the surprize of everybody, and to the vexation of all the young women in
25
these parts, had publickly shone forth on a Sunday in a new silk gown, with a laced cap, and other proper appendages to these.
The flame, which had before lain in embryo, now burst forth. Jenny had, by her learning, increased her own pride, which none of her neighbours were kind enough to feed with the honour she seemed to demand; and now, instead of respect and adoration, she gained nothing but hatred and abuse by her finery. The whole parish declared she could not come honestly by such things; and parents, instead of wishing their daughters the same, felicitated themselves that their children had them not.
Hence, perhaps, it was, that the good woman first mentioned the name of this poor girl to Mrs Wilkins; but there was another circumstance that confirmed the latter in her suspicion; for Jenny had lately been often at Mr Allworthy's house. She had officiated as nurse to Miss Bridget, in a violent fit of illness, and had sat up many nights with that lady; besides which, she had been seen there the very day before Mr Allworthy's return, by Mrs Wilkins herself, though that sagacious person had not at first conceived any suspicion of her on that account: for, as she herself said, "She had always esteemed Jenny as a very sober girl (though indeed she knew very little of her), and had rather suspected some of those wanton trollops, who gave themselves airs, because, forsooth, they thought themselves handsome."
Jenny was now summoned to appear in person before Mrs Deborah, which she immediately did. When Mrs Deborah, putting on the gravity of a judge, with somewhat more than his austerity, began an oration with the words, "You audacious strumpet!" in which she proceeded rather to pass sentence on the prisoner than to accuse her.
Though Mrs Deborah was fully satisfied of the guilt of Jenny, from the reasons above shewn, it is possible Mr Allworthy might have required some stronger evidence to have convicted her; but she saved her accusers any such trouble, by freely confessing the whole fact with which she was charged.
This confession, though delivered rather in terms of contrition, as it appeared, did not at all mollify Mrs Deborah, who now pronounced a second judgment against her, in more opprobrious language than before; nor had it any better success with the bystanders, who were now grown very numerous. Many of them cried out, "They thought what madam's silk gown would end in;" others spoke sarcastically of her learning. Not a single female was present but found some means of expressing her
26
abhorrence of poor Jenny, who bore all very patiently, except the malice of one woman, who reflected upon her person, and tossing up her nose, said, "The man must have a good stomach who would give silk gowns for such sort of trumpery!" Jenny replied to this with a bitterness which might have surprized a judicious person, who had observed the tranquillity with which she bore all the affronts to her chastity; but her patience was perhaps tired out, for this is a virtue which is very apt to be fatigued by exercise.
Mrs Deborah having succeeded beyond her hopes in her inquiry, returned with much triumph, and, at the appointed hour, made a faithful report to Mr Allworthy, who was much surprized at the relation; for he had heard of the extraordinary parts and improvements of this girl, whom he intended to have given in marriage, together with a small living, to a neighbouring curate. His concern, therefore, on this occasion, was at least equal to the satisfaction which appeared in Mrs Deborah, and to many readers may seem much more reasonable.
Miss Bridget blessed herself, and said, "For her part, she should never hereafter entertain a good opinion of any woman." For Jenny before this had the happiness of being much in her good graces also.
The prudent housekeeper was again dispatched to bring the unhappy culprit before Mr Allworthy, in order, not as it was hoped by some, and expected by all, to be sent to the house of correction, but to receive wholesome admonition and reproof; which those who relish that kind of instructive writing may peruse in the next chapter.
27

Chapter /
Containing such grave matter, that the reader cannot laugh once through the whole chapter, unless peradventure he should laugh at the author.
When Jenny appeared, Mr Allworthy took her into his study, and spoke to her as follows: "You know, child, it is in my power as a magistrate, to punish you very rigorously for what you have done; and you will, perhaps, be the more apt to fear I should execute that power, because you have in a manner laid your sins at my door.
"But, perhaps, this is one reason which hath determined me to act in a milder manner with you: for, as no private resentment should ever influence a magistrate, I will be so far from considering your having deposited the infant in my house as an aggravation of your offence, that I will suppose, in your favour, this to have proceeded from a natural affection to your child, since you might have some hopes to see it thus better provided for than was in the power of yourself, or its wicked father, to provide for it. I should indeed have been highly offended with you had you exposed the little wretch in the manner of some inhuman mothers, who seem no less to have abandoned their humanity, than to have parted with their chastity. It is the other part of your offence, therefore, upon which I intend to admonish you, I mean the violation of your chastity;一a crime, however lightly it may be treated by debauched persons, very heinous in itself, and very dreadful in its consequences.
"The heinous nature of this offence must be sufficiently apparent to every Christian, inasmuch as it is committed in defiance of the laws of our religion, and of the express commands of Him who founded that religion.
"And here its consequences may well be argued to be dreadful; for what can be more so, than to incur the divine displeasure, by the breach of the divine commands; and that in an instance against which the highest vengeance is specifically denounced?
28
"But these things, though too little, I am afraid, regarded, are so plain, that mankind, however they may want to be reminded, can never need information on this head. A hint, therefore, to awaken your sense of this matter, shall suffice; for I would inspire you with repentance, and not drive you to desperation.
"There are other consequences, not indeed so dreadful or replete with horror as this; and yet such, as, if attentively considered, must, one would think, deter all of your sex at least from the commission of this crime.
"For by it you are rendered infamous, and driven, like lepers of old, out of society; at least, from the society of all but wicked and reprobate persons; for no others will associate with you.
"If you have fortunes, you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying them; if you have none, you are disabled from acquiring any, nay almost of procuring your sustenance; for no persons of character will receive you into their houses. Thus you are often driven by necessity itself into a state of shame and misery, which unavoidably ends in the destruction of both body and soul.
"Can any pleasure compensate these evils? Can any temptation have sophistry and delusion strong enough to persuade you to so simple a bargain? Or can any carnal appetite so overpower your reason, or so totally lay it asleep, as to prevent your flying with affright and terror from a crime which carries such punishment always with it?
"How base and mean must that woman be, how void of that dignity of mind, and decent pride, without which we are not worthy the name of human creatures, who can bear to level herself with the lowest animal, and to sacrifice all that is great and noble in her, all her heavenly part, to an appetite which she hath in common with the vilest branch of the creation! For no woman, sure, will plead the passion of love for an excuse. This would be to own herself the mere tool and bubble of the man. Love, however barbarously we may corrupt and pervert its meaning, as it is a laudable, is a rational passion, and can never be violent but when reciprocal; for though the Scripture bids us love our enemies, it means not with that fervent love which we naturally bear towards our friends; much less that we should sacrifice to them our lives, and what ought to be dearer to us, our innocence. Now in what light, but that of an enemy, can a reasonable woman regard the man who solicits her to entail on herself all the misery I have described to you, and who would purchase to himself a short, trivial, contemptible pleasure, so greatly at her expense!
29
For, by the laws of custom, the whole shame, with all its dreadful consequences, falls intirely upon her. Can love, which always seeks the good of its object, attempt to betray a woman into a bargain where she is so greatly to be the loser? If such corrupter, therefore, should have the impudence to pretend a real affection for her, ought not the woman to regard him not only as an enemy, but as the worst of all enemies, a false, designing, treacherous, pretended friend, who intends not only to debauch her body, but her understanding at the same time?"
Here Jenny expressing great concern, Allworthy paused a moment, and then proceeded: "I have talked thus to you, child, not to insult you for what is past and irrevocable, but to caution and strengthen you for the future. Nor should I have taken this trouble, but from some opinion of your good sense, notwithstanding the dreadful slip you have made; and from some hopes of your hearty repentance, which are founded on the openness and sincerity of your confession. If these do not deceive me, I will take care to convey you from this scene of your shame, where you shall, by being unknown, avoid the punishment which, as I have said, is allotted to your crime in this world; and I hope, by repentance, you will avoid the much heavier sentence denounced against it in the other. Be a good girl the rest of your days, and want shall be no motive to your going astray; and, believe me, there is more pleasure, even in this world, in an innocent and virtuous life, than in one debauched and vicious.
"As to your child, let no thoughts concerning it molest you; I will provide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope. And now nothing remains but that you inform me who was the wicked man that seduced you; for my anger against him will be much greater than you have experienced on this occasion."
Jenny now lifted her eyes from the ground, and with a modest look and decent voice thus began:一
"To know you, sir, and not love your goodness, would be an argument of total want of sense or goodness in any one. In me it would amount to the highest ingratitude, not to feel, in the most sensible manner, the great degree of goodness you have been pleased to exert on this occasion. As to my concern for what is past, I know you will spare my blushes the repetition. My future conduct will much better declare my sentiments than any professions I can now make. I beg leave to assure you, sir, that I take your advice much kinder than your generous offer with which you concluded it; for, as you are pleased to say, sir, it is an instance of your opinion of my understanding."一Here her tears flowing apace, she stopped a
30
few moments, and then proceeded thus:一"Indeed, sir, your kindness overcomes me; but I will endeavour to deserve this good opinion: for if I have the understanding you are so kindly pleased to allow me, such advice cannot be thrown away upon me. I thank you, sir, heartily, for your intended kindness to my poor helpless child: he is innocent, and I hope will live to be grateful for all the favours you shall show him. But now, sir, I must on my knees entreat you not to persist in asking me to declare the father of my infant. I promise you faithfully you shall one day know; but I am under the most solemn ties and engagements of honour, as well as the most religious vows and protestations, to conceal his name at this time. And I know you too well, to think you would desire I should sacrifice either my honour or my religion."
Mr Allworthy, whom the least mention of those sacred words was sufficient to stagger, hesitated a moment before he replied, and then told her, she had done wrong to enter into such engagements to a villain; but since she had, he could not insist on her breaking them. He said, it was not from a motive of vain curiosity he had inquired, but in order to punish the fellow; at least, that he might not ignorantly confer favours on the undeserving.
As to these points, Jenny satisfied him by the most solemn assurances, that the man was entirely out of his reach; and was neither subject to his power, nor in any probability of becoming an object of his goodness.
The ingenuity of this behaviour had gained Jenny so much credit with this worthy man, that he easily believed what she told him; for as she had disdained to excuse herself by a lie, and had hazarded his further displeasure in her present situation, rather than she would forfeit her honour or integrity by betraying another, he had but little apprehensions that she would be guilty of falsehood towards himself.
He therefore dismissed her with assurances that he would very soon remove her out of the reach of that obloquy she had incurred; concluding with some additional documents, in which he recommended repentance, saying, "Consider, child, there is one still to reconcile yourself to, whose favour is of much greater importance to you than mine."

Chapter V?
A dialogue between Mesdames Bridget and Deborah; containing more amusement, but less instruction, than the former.
When Mr Allworthy had retired to his study with Jenny Jones, as hath been seen, Mrs Bridget, with the good housekeeper, had betaken themselves to a post next adjoining to the said study; whence, through the conveyance of a keyhole, they sucked in at their ears the instructive lecture delivered by Mr Allworthy, together with the answers of Jenny, and indeed every other particular which passed in the last chapter.
This hole in her brother's study-door was indeed as well known to Mrs Bridget, and had been as frequently applied to by her, as the famous hole in the wall was by Thisbe of old. This served to many good purposes. For by such means Mrs Bridget became often acquainted with her brother's inclinations, without giving him the trouble of repeating them to her. It is true, some inconveniences attended this intercourse, and she had sometimes reason to cry out with Thisbe, in Shakspeare, "O, wicked, wicked wall!" For as Mr Allworthy was a justice of peace, certain things occurred in examinations concerning bastards, and such like, which are apt to give great offence to the chaste ears of virgins, especially when they approach the age of forty, as was the case of Mrs Bridget. However, she had, on such occasions, the advantage of concealing her blushes from the eyes of men; and De non apparentibus, et non existentibus eadem est ratio—in English, "When a woman is not seen to blush, she doth not blush at all."
Both the good women kept strict silence during the whole scene between Mr Allworthy and the girl; but as soon as it was ended, and that gentleman was out of hearing, Mrs Deborah could not help exclaiming against the clemency of her master, and especially against his suffering her to conceal the father of the child, which she swore she would have out of her before the sun set.
32
At these words Mrs Bridget discomposed her features with a smile (a thing very unusual to her). Not that I would have my reader imagine, that this was one of those wanton smiles which Homer would have you conceive came from Venus, when he calls her the laughter-loving goddess; nor was it one of those smiles which Lady Seraphina shoots from the stage-box, and which Venus would quit her immortality to be able to equal. No, this was rather one of those smiles which might be supposed to have come from the dimpled cheeks of the august Tisiphone, or from one of the misses, her sisters.
With such a smile then, and with a voice sweet as the evening breeze of Boreas in the pleasant month of November, Mrs Bridget gently reproved the curiosity of Mrs Deborah; a vice with which it seems the latter was too much tainted, and which the former inveighed against with great bitterness, adding, "That, among all her faults, she thanked Heaven her enemies could not accuse her of prying into the affairs of other people."
She then proceeded to commend the honour and spirit with which Jenny had acted. She said, she could not help agreeing with her brother, that there was some merit in the sincerity of her confession, and in her integrity to her lover: that she had always thought her a very good girl, and doubted not but she had been seduced by some rascal, who had been infinitely more to blame than herself, and very probably had prevailed with her by a promise of marriage, or some other treacherous proceeding.
This behaviour of Mrs Bridget greatly surprised Mrs Deborah; for this well-bred woman seldom opened her lips, either to her master or his sister, till she had first sounded their inclinations, with which her sentiments were always consonant. Here, however, she thought she might have launched forth with safety; and the sagacious reader will not perhaps accuse her of want of sufficient forecast in so doing, but will rather admire with what wonderful celerity she tacked about, when she found herself steering a wrong course.
"Nay, madam," said this able woman, and truly great politician, "I must own I cannot help admiring the girl's spirit, as well as your ladyship. And, as your ladyship says, if she was deceived by some wicked man, the poor wretch is to be pitied. And to be sure, as your ladyship says, the girl hath always appeared like a good, honest, plain girl, and not vain of her face, forsooth, as some wanton husseys in the neighbourhood are."
33
"You say true, Deborah," said Miss Bridget. "If the girl had been one of those vain trollops, of which we have too many in the parish, I should have condemned my brother for his lenity towards her. I saw two farmers' daughters at church, the other day, with bare necks. I protest they shocked me. If wenches will hang out lures for fellows, it is no matter what they suffer. I detest such creatures; and it would be much better for them that their faces had been seamed with the smallpox; but I must confess, I never saw any of this wanton behaviour in poor Jenny: some artful villain, I am convinced, hath betrayed, nay perhaps forced her; and I pity the poor wretch with all my heart."
Mrs Deborah approved all these sentiments, and the dialogue concluded with a general and bitter invective against beauty, and with many compassionate considerations for all honest plain girls who are deluded by the wicked arts of deceitful men.

Chapter J
Containing matters which will surprize the reader.
Jenny returned home well pleased with the reception she had met with from Mr Allworthy, whose indulgence to her she industriously made public; partly perhaps as a sacrifice to her own pride, and partly from the more prudent motive of reconciling her neighbours to her, and silencing their clamours.
But though this latter view, if she indeed had it, may appear reasonable enough, yet the event did not answer her expectation; for when she was convened before the justice, and it was universally apprehended that the house of correction would have been her fate, though some of the young women cryed out "It was good enough for her," and diverted themselves with the thoughts of her beating hemp in a silk gown; yet there were many others who began to pity her condition: but when it was known in what manner Mr Allworthy had behaved, the tide turned against her. One said, "I'll assure you, madam hath had good luck." A second cryed, "See what it is to be a favourite!" A third, "Ay, this comes of her learning." Every person made some malicious comment or other on the occasion, and reflected on the partiality of the justice.
The behaviour of these people may appear impolitic and ungrateful to the reader, who considers the power and benevolence of Mr Allworthy. But as to his power, he never used it; and as to his benevolence, he exerted so much, that he had thereby disobliged all his neighbours; for it is a secret well known to great men, that, by conferring an obligation, they do not always procure a friend, but are certain of creating many enemies.
Jenny was, however, by the care and goodness of Mr Allworthy, soon removed out of the reach of reproach; when malice being no longer able to vent its rage on her, began to seek another object of its bitterness, and this was no less than Mr Allworthy, himself; for a whisper soon went abroad, that he himself was the father of the foundling child.
35
This supposition so well reconciled his conduct to the general opinion, that it met with universal assent; and the outcry against his lenity soon began to take another turn, and was changed into an invective against his cruelty to the poor girl. Very grave and good women exclaimed against men who begot children, and then disowned them. Nor were there wanting some, who, after the departure of Jenny, insinuated that she was spirited away with a design too black to be mentioned, and who gave frequent hints that a legal inquiry ought to be made into the whole matter, and that some people should be forced to produce the girl.
These calumnies might have probably produced ill consequences, at the least might have occasioned some trouble, to a person of a more doubtful and suspicious character than Mr Allworthy was blessed with; but in his case they had no such effect; and, being heartily despised by him, they served only to afford an innocent amusement to the good gossips of the neighbourhood.
But as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be of, and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of Jenny, we think proper to give him a very early intimation, that Mr Allworthy was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any criminal intention whatever. He had indeed committed no other than an error in politics, by tempering justice with mercy, and by refusing to gratify the good-natured disposition of the mob,1
with an object for their compassion to work on in the person of poor Jenny, whom, in order to pity, they desired to have seen sacrificed to ruin and infamy, by a shameful correction in Bridewell.
So far from complying with this their inclination, by which all hopes of reformation would have been abolished, and even the gate shut against her if her own inclinations should ever hereafter lead her to chuse the road of virtue, Mr Allworthy rather chose to encourage the girl to return thither by the only possible means; for too true I am afraid it is, that many women have become abandoned, and have sunk to the last degree of vice, by being unable to retrieve the first slip. This will be, I am afraid, always the case while they remain among their former acquaintance; it was therefore wisely done by Mr Allworthy, to remove Jenny to a place where she might enjoy the pleasure of reputation, after having tasted the ill consequences of losing it.

Chapter A Vx
The hospitality of Allworthy; with a short sketch of the characters of two brothers, a doctor and a captain, who were entertained by that gentleman.
Neither Mr Allworthy's house, nor his heart, were shut against any part of mankind, but they were both more particularly open to men of merit. To say the truth, this was the only house in the kingdom where you was sure to gain a dinner by deserving it.
Above all others, men of genius and learning shared the principal place in his favour; and in these he had much discernment: for though he had missed the advantage of a learned education, yet, being blest with vast natural abilities, he had so well profited by a vigorous though late application to letters, and by much conversation with men of eminence in this way, that he was himself a very competent judge in most kinds of literature.
It is no wonder that in an age when this kind of merit is so little in fashion, and so slenderly provided for, persons possessed of it should very eagerly flock to a place where they were sure of being received with great complaisance; indeed, where they might enjoy almost the same advantages of a liberal fortune as if they were entitled to it in their own right; for Mr Allworthy was not one of those generous persons who are ready most bountifully to bestow meat, drink, and lodging on men of wit and learning, for which they expect no other return but entertainment, instruction, flattery, and subserviency; in a word, that such persons should be enrolled in the number of domestics, without wearing their master's cloathes, or receiving wages.
On the contrary, every person in this house was perfect master of his own time: and as he might at his pleasure satisfy all his appetites within the restrictions only of law, virtue, and religion; so he might, if his health required, or his inclination prompted him to temperance, or even to abstinence, absent himself from any meals, or retire from them, whenever
38
he was so disposed, without even a sollicitation to the contrary: for, indeed, such sollicitations from superiors always savour very strongly of commands. But all here were free from such impertinence, not only those whose company is in all other places esteemed a favour from their equality of fortune, but even those whose indigent circumstances make such an eleemosynary abode convenient to them, and who are therefore less welcome to a great man's table because they stand in need of it.
Among others of this kind was Dr Blifil, a gentleman who had the misfortune of losing the advantage of great talents by the obstinacy of a father, who would breed him to a profession he disliked. In obedience to this obstinacy the doctor had in his youth been obliged to study physic, or rather to say he studied it; for in reality books of this kind were almost the only ones with which he was unacquainted; and unfortunately for him, the doctor was master of almost every other science but that by which he was to get his bread; the consequence of which was, that the doctor at the age of forty had no bread to eat.
Such a person as this was certain to find a welcome at Mr Allworthy's table, to whom misfortunes were ever a recommendation, when they were derived from the folly or villany of others, and not of the unfortunate person himself. Besides this negative merit, the doctor had one positive recommendation;一this was a great appearance of religion. Whether his religion was real, or consisted only in appearance, I shall not presume to say, as I am not possessed of any touchstone which can distinguish the true from the false.
If this part of his character pleased Mr Allworthy, it delighted Miss Bridget. She engaged him in many religious controversies; on which occasions she constantly expressed great satisfaction in the doctor's knowledge, and not much less in the compliments which he frequently bestowed on her own. To say the truth, she had read much English divinity, and had puzzled more than one of the neighbouring curates. Indeed, her conversation was so pure, her looks so sage, and her whole deportment so grave and solemn, that she seemed to deserve the name of saint equally with her namesake, or with any other female in the Roman kalendar.
As sympathies of all kinds are apt to beget love, so experience teaches us that none have a more direct tendency this way than those of a religious kind between persons of different sexes. The doctor found himself so agreeable to Miss Bridget, that he now began to lament an unfortunate accident which had happened to him about ten years before; namely, his
39
marriage with another woman, who was not only still alive, but, what was worse, known to be so by Mr Allworthy. This was a fatal bar to that happiness which he otherwise saw sufficient probability of obtaining with this young lady; for as to criminal indulgences, he certainly never thought of them. This was owing either to his religion, as is most probable, or to the purity of his passion, which was fixed on those things which matrimony only, and not criminal correspondence, could put him in possession of, or could give him any title to.
He had not long ruminated on these matters, before it occurred to his memory that he had a brother who was under no such unhappy incapacity. This brother he made no doubt would succeed; for he discerned, as he thought, an inclination to marriage in the lady; and the reader perhaps, when he hears the brother's qualifications, will not blame the confidence which he entertained of his success.
This gentleman was about thirty-five years of age. He was of a middle size, and what is called well-built. He had a scar on his forehead, which did not so much injure his beauty as it denoted his valour (for he was a half-pay officer). He had good teeth, and something affable, when he pleased, in his smile; though naturally his countenance, as well as his air and voice, had much of roughness in it: yet he could at any time deposit this, and appear all gentleness and good-humour. He was not ungenteel, nor entirely devoid of wit, and in his youth had abounded in sprightliness, which, though he had lately put on a more serious character, he could, when he pleased, resume.
He had, as well as the doctor, an academic education; for his father had, with the same paternal authority we have mentioned before, decreed him for holy orders; but as the old gentleman died before he was ordained, he chose the church military, and preferred the king's commission to the bishop's.
He had purchased the post of lieutenant of dragoons, and afterwards came to be a captain; but having quarrelled with his colonel, was by his interest obliged to sell; from which time he had entirely rusticated himself, had betaken himself to studying the Scriptures, and was not a little suspected of an inclination to methodism.
It seemed, therefore, not unlikely that such a person should succeed with a lady of so saint-like a disposition, and whose inclinations were no otherwise engaged than to the marriage state in general; but why the doctor, who certainly had no great friendship for his brother, should for
40
his sake think of making so ill a return to the hospitality of Allworthy, is a matter not so easy to be accounted for.
Is it that some natures delight in evil, as others are thought to delight in virtue? Or is there a pleasure in being accessory to a theft when we cannot commit it ourselves? Or lastly (which experience seems to make probable), have we a satisfaction in aggrandizing our families, even though we have not the least love or respect for them?
Whether any of these motives operated on the doctor, we will not determine; but so the fact was. He sent for his brother, and easily found means to introduce him at Allworthy's as a person who intended only a short visit to himself.
The captain had not been in the house a week before the doctor had reason to felicitate himself on his discernment. The captain was indeed as great a master of the art of love as Ovid was formerly. He had besides received proper hints from his brother, which he failed not to improve to the best advantage.
41
Containing many rules, and some examples, concerning falling in love: descriptions of beauty, and other more prudential inducements to matrimony.
It hath been observed, by wise men or women, I forget which, that all persons are doomed to be in love once in their lives. No particular season is, as I remember, assigned for this; but the age at which Miss Bridget was arrived, seems to me as proper a period as any to be fixed on for this purpose: it often, indeed, happens much earlier; but when it doth not, I have observed it seldom or never fails about this time. Moreover, we may remark that at this season love is of a more serious and steady nature than what sometimes shows itself in the younger parts of life. The love of girls is uncertain, capricious, and so foolish that we cannot always discover what the young lady would be at; nay, it may almost be doubted whether she always knows this herself.
Now we are never at a loss to discern this in women about forty; for as such grave, serious, and experienced ladies well know their own meaning, so it is always very easy for a man of the least sagacity to discover it with the utmost certainty.
Miss Bridget is an example of all these observations. She had not been many times in the captain's company before she was seized with this passion. Nor did she go pining and moping about the house, like a puny, foolish girl, ignorant of her distemper: she felt, she knew, and she enjoyed, the pleasing sensation, of which, as she was certain it was not only innocent but laudable, she was neither afraid nor ashamed.
And to say the truth, there is, in all points, great difference between the reasonable passion which women at this age conceive towards men, and the idle and childish liking of a girl to a boy, which is often fixed on the outside only, and on things of little value and no duration; as on cherry-cheeks, small, lily-white hands, sloe-black eyes, flowing locks, downy chins, dapper shapes; nay, sometimes on charms more worthless
42
than these, and less the party's own; such are the outward ornaments of the person, for which men are beholden to the taylor, the laceman, the periwig-maker, the hatter, and the milliner, and not to nature. Such a passion girls may well be ashamed, as they generally are, to own either to themselves or others.
The love of Miss Bridget was of another kind. The captain owed nothing to any of these fop-makers in his dress, nor was his person much more beholden to nature. Both his dress and person were such as, had they appeared in an assembly or a drawing-room, would have been the contempt and ridicule of all the fine ladies there. The former of these was indeed neat, but plain, coarse, ill-fancied, and out of fashion. As for the latter, we have expressly described it above. So far was the skin on his cheeks from being cherry-coloured, that you could not discern what the natural colour of his cheeks was, they being totally overgrown by a black beard, which ascended to his eyes. His shape and limbs were indeed exactly proportioned, but so large that they denoted the strength rather of a ploughman than any other. His shoulders were broad beyond all size, and the calves of his legs larger than those of a common chairman. In short, his whole person wanted all that elegance and beauty which is the very reverse of clumsy strength, and which so agreeably sets off most of our fine gentlemen; being partly owing to the high blood of their ancestors, viz., blood made of rich sauces and generous wines, and partly to an early town education.
Though Miss Bridget was a woman of the greatest delicacy of taste, yet such were the charms of the captain's conversation, that she totally overlooked the defects of his person. She imagined, and perhaps very wisely, that she should enjoy more agreeable minutes with the captain than with a much prettier fellow; and forewent the consideration of pleasing her eyes, in order to procure herself much more solid satisfaction.
The captain no sooner perceived the passion of Miss Bridget, in which discovery he was very quick-sighted, than he faithfully returned it. The lady, no more than her lover, was remarkable for beauty. I would attempt to draw her picture, but that is done already by a more able master, Mr Hogarth himself, to whom she sat many years ago, and hath been lately exhibited by that gentleman in his print of a winter's morning, of which she was no improper emblem, and may be seen walking (for walk she doth in the print) to Covent Garden church, with a starved foot-boy behind carrying her prayer-book.
43
The captain likewise very wisely preferred the more solid enjoyments he expected with this lady, to the fleeting charms of person. He was one of those wise men who regard beauty in the other sex as a very worthless and superficial qualification; or, to speak more truly, who rather chuse to possess every convenience of life with an ugly woman, than a handsome one without any of those conveniences. And having a very good appetite, and but little nicety, he fancied he should play his part very well at the matrimonial banquet, without the sauce of beauty.
To deal plainly with the reader, the captain, ever since his arrival, at least from the moment his brother had proposed the match to him, long before he had discovered any flattering symptoms in Miss Bridget, had been greatly enamoured; that is to say, of Mr Allworthy's house and gardens, and of his lands, tenements, and hereditaments; of all which the captain was so passionately fond, that he would most probably have contracted marriage with them, had he been obliged to have taken the witch of Endor into the bargain.
As Mr Allworthy, therefore, had declared to the doctor that he never intended to take a second wife, as his sister was his nearest relation, and as the doctor had fished out that his intentions were to make any child of hers his heir, which indeed the law, without his interposition, would have done for him; the doctor and his brother thought it an act of benevolence to give being to a human creature, who would be so plentifully provided with the most essential means of happiness. The whole thoughts, therefore, of both the brothers were how to engage the affections of this amiable lady.
But fortune, who is a tender parent, and often doth more for her favourite offspring than either they deserve or wish, had been so industrious for the captain, that whilst he was laying schemes to execute his purpose, the lady conceived the same desires with himself, and was on her side contriving how to give the captain proper encouragement, without appearing too forward; for she was a strict observer of all rules of decorum. In this, however, she easily succeeded; for as the captain was always on the look-out, no glance, gesture, or word escaped him.
The satisfaction which the captain received from the kind behaviour of Miss Bridget, was not a little abated by his apprehensions of Mr Allworthy; for, notwithstanding his disinterested professions, the captain imagined he would, when he came to act, follow the example of the rest of the world, and refuse his consent to a match so disadvantageous, in point of interest, to his sister. From what oracle he received this opinion,
44
I shall leave the reader to determine: but however he came by it, it strangely perplexed him how to regulate his conduct so as at once to convey his affection to the lady, and to conceal it from her brother. He at length resolved to take all private opportunities of making his addresses; but in the presence of Mr Allworthy to be as reserved and as much upon his guard as was possible; and this conduct was highly approved by the brother.
He soon found means to make his addresses, in express terms, to his mistress, from whom he received an answer in the proper form, viz.: the answer which was first made some thousands of years ago, and which hath been handed down by tradition from mother to daughter ever since. If I was to translate this into Latin, I should render it by these two words, Nolo Episcopari: a phrase likewise of immemorial use on another occasion.
The captain, however he came by his knowledge, perfectly well understood the lady, and very soon after repeated his application with more warmth and earnestness than before, and was again, according to due form, rejected; but as he had increased in the eagerness of his desires, so the lady, with the same propriety, decreased in the violence of her refusal.
Not to tire the reader, by leading him through every scene of this courtship (which, though in the opinion of a certain great author, it is the pleasantest scene of life to the actor, is, perhaps, as dull and tiresome as any whatever to the audience), the captain made his advances in form, the citadel was defended in form, and at length, in proper form, surrendered at discretion.
During this whole time, which filled the space of near a month, the captain preserved great distance of behaviour to his lady in the presence of the brother; and the more he succeeded with her in private, the more reserved was he in public. And as for the lady, she had no sooner secured her lover than she behaved to him before company with the highest degree of indifference; so that Mr Allworthy must have had the insight of the devil (or perhaps some of his worse qualities) to have entertained the least suspicion of what was going forward.

Chapter 且
Containing what the reader may, perhaps, expect to find in it.
In all bargains, whether to fight or to marry, or concerning any other such business, little previous ceremony is required to bring the matter to an issue when both parties are really in earnest. This was the case at present, and in less than a month the captain and his lady were man and wife.
The great concern now was to break the matter to Mr Allworthy; and this was undertaken by the doctor.
One day, then, as Allworthy was walking in his garden, the doctor came to him, and, with great gravity of aspect, and all the concern which he could possibly affect in his countenance, said, "I am come, sir, to impart an affair to you of the utmost consequence; but how shall I mention to you what it almost distracts me to think of!" He then launched forth into the most bitter invectives both against men and women; accusing the former of having no attachment but to their interest, and the latter of being so addicted to vicious inclinations that they could never be safely trusted with one of the other sex. "Could I," said he, "sir, have suspected that a lady of such prudence, such judgment, such learning, should indulge so indiscreet a passion! or could I have imagined that my broth-er一why do I call him so? he is no longer a brother of mine-"
"Indeed but he is," said Allworthy, "and a brother of mine too."
"Bless me, sir!" said the doctor, "do you know the shocking affair?"
"Look'ee, Mr Blifil," answered the good man, "it hath been my constant maxim in life to make the best of all matters which happen. My sister, though many years younger than I, is at least old enough to be at the age of discretion. Had he imposed on a child, I should have been more averse to have forgiven him; but a woman upwards of thirty must certainly be supposed to know what will make her most happy. She hath married a gentleman, though perhaps not quite her equal in fortune; and if he hath any perfections in her eye which can make up that deficiency, I
46
see no reason why I should object to her choice of her own happiness; which I, no more than herself, imagine to consist only in immense wealth. I might, perhaps, from the many declarations I have made of complying with almost any proposal, have expected to have been consulted on this occasion; but these matters are of a very delicate nature, and the scruples of modesty, perhaps, are not to be overcome. As to your brother, I have really no anger against him at all. He hath no obligations to me, nor do I think he was under any necessity of asking my consent, since the woman is, as I have said, sui juris, and of a proper age to be entirely answerable only, to herself for her conduct."
The doctor accused Mr Allworthy of too great lenity, repeated his accusations against his brother, and declared that he should never more be brought either to see, or to own him for his relation. He then launched forth into a panegyric on Allworthy's goodness; into the highest encomiums on his friendship; and concluded by saying, he should never forgive his brother for having put the place which he bore in that friendship to a hazard.
Allworthy thus answered: "Had I conceived any displeasure against your brother, I should never have carried that resentment to the innocent: but I assure you I have no such displeasure. Your brother appears to me to be a man of sense and honour. I do not disapprove the taste of my sister; nor will I doubt but that she is equally the object of his inclinations. I have always thought love the only foundation of happiness in a married state, as it can only produce that high and tender friendship which should always be the cement of this union; and, in my opinion, all those marriages which are contracted from other motives are greatly criminal; they are a profanation of a most holy ceremony, and generally end in disquiet and misery: for surely we may call it a profanation to convert this most sacred institution into a wicked sacrifice to lust or avarice: and what better can be said of those matches to which men are induced merely by the consideration of a beautiful person, or a great fortune?
"To deny that beauty is an agreeable object to the eye, and even worthy some admiration, would be false and foolish. Beautiful is an epithet often used in Scripture, and always mentioned with honour. It was my own fortune to marry a woman whom the world thought handsome, and I can truly say I liked her the better on that account. But to make this the sole consideration of marriage, to lust after it so violently as to overlook all imperfections for its sake, or to require it so absolutely as to reject and disdain religion, virtue, and sense, which are qualities in their
47
nature of much higher perfection, only because an elegance of person is wanting: this is surely inconsistent, either with a wise man or a good Christian. And it is, perhaps, being too charitable to conclude that such persons mean anything more by their marriage than to please their carnal appetites; for the satisfaction of which, we are taught, it was not ordained.
"In the next place, with respect to fortune. Worldly prudence, perhaps, exacts some consideration on this head; nor will I absolutely and altogether condemn it. As the world is constituted, the demands of a married state, and the care of posterity, require some little regard to what we call circumstances. Yet this provision is greatly increased, beyond what is really necessary, by folly and vanity, which create abundantly more wants than nature. Equipage for the wife, and large fortunes for the children, are by custom enrolled in the list of necessaries; and to procure these, everything truly solid and sweet, and virtuous and religious, are neglected and overlooked.
"And this in many degrees; the last and greatest of which seems scarce distinguishable from madness;一I mean where persons of immense fortunes contract themselves to those who are, and must be, disagreeable to them一to fools and knaves一in order to increase an estate already larger even than the demands of their pleasures. Surely such persons, if they will not be thought mad, must own, either that they are incapable of tasting the sweets of the tenderest friendship, or that they sacrifice the greatest happiness of which they are capable to the vain, uncertain, and senseless laws of vulgar opinion, which owe as well their force as their foundation to folly."
Here Allworthy concluded his sermon, to which Blifil had listened with the profoundest attention, though it cost him some pains to prevent now and then a small discomposure of his muscles. He now praised every period of what he had heard with the warmth of a young divine, who hath the honour to dine with a bishop the same day in which his lordship hath mounted the pulpit.
48

Chapter 且 U
Which concludes the first book; with an instance of ingratitude, which, we hope, will appear unnatural.
The reader, from what hath been said, may imagine that the reconciliation (if indeed it could be so called) was only matter of form; we shall therefore pass it over, and hasten to what must surely be thought matter of substance.
The doctor had acquainted his brother with what had past between Mr Allworthy and him; and added with a smile, "I promise you I paid you off; nay, I absolutely desired the good gentleman not to forgive you: for you know after he had made a declaration in your favour, I might with safety venture on such a request with a person of his temper; and I was willing, as well for your sake as for my own, to prevent the least possibility of a suspicion."
Captain Blifil took not the least notice of this, at that time; but he afterwards made a very notable use of it.
One of the maxims which the devil, in a late visit upon earth, left to his disciples, is, when once you are got up, to kick the stool from under you. In plain English, when you have made your fortune by the good offices of a friend, you are advised to discard him as soon as you can.
Whether the captain acted by this maxim, I will not positively determine: so far we may confidently say, that his actions may be fairly derived from this diabolical principle; and indeed it is difficult to assign any other motive to them: for no sooner was he possessed of Miss Bridget, and reconciled to Allworthy, than he began to show a coldness to his brother which increased daily; till at length it grew into rudeness, and became very visible to every one.
The doctor remonstrated to him privately concerning this behaviour, but could obtain no other satisfaction than the following plain declaration: "If you dislike anything in my brother's house, sir, you know you are at liberty to quit it." This strange, cruel, and almost unaccountable
49
ingratitude in the captain, absolutely broke the poor doctor's heart; for ingratitude never so thoroughly pierces the human breast as when it proceeds from those in whose behalf we have been guilty of transgressions. Reflections on great and good actions, however they are received or returned by those in whose favour they are performed, always administer some comfort to us; but what consolation shall we receive under so biting a calamity as the ungrateful behaviour of our friend, when our wounded conscience at the same time flies in our face, and upbraids us with having spotted it in the service of one so worthless!
Mr Allworthy himself spoke to the captain in his brother's behalf, and desired to know what offence the doctor had committed; when the hardhearted villain had the baseness to say that he should never forgive him for the injury which he had endeavoured to do him in his favour; which, he said, he had pumped out of him, and was such a cruelty that it ought not to be forgiven.
Allworthy spoke in very high terms upon this declaration, which, he said, became not a human creature. He expressed, indeed, so much resentment against an unforgiving temper, that the captain at last pretended to be convinced by his arguments, and outwardly professed to be reconciled.
As for the bride, she was now in her honeymoon, and so passionately fond of her new husband that he never appeared to her to be in the wrong; and his displeasure against any person was a sufficient reason for her dislike to the same.
The captain, at Mr Allworthy's instance, was outwardly, as we have said, reconciled to his brother; yet the same rancour remained in his heart; and he found so many opportunities of giving him private hints of this, that the house at last grew insupportable to the poor doctor; and he chose rather to submit to any inconveniences which he might encounter in the world, than longer to bear these cruel and ungrateful insults from a brother for whom he had done so much.
He once intended to acquaint Allworthy with the whole; but he could not bring himself to submit to the confession, by which he must take to his share so great a portion of guilt. Besides, by how much the worse man he represented his brother to be, so much the greater would his own offence appear to Allworthy, and so much the greater, he had reason to imagine, would be his resentment.
He feigned, therefore, some excuse of business for his departure, and promised to return soon again; and took leave of his brother with so
50
well-dissembled content, that, as the captain played his part to the same perfection, Allworthy remained well satisfied with the truth of the reconciliation.
The doctor went directly to London, where he died soon after of a broken heart; a distemper which kills many more than is generally imagined, and would have a fair title to a place in the bill of mortality, did it not differ in one instance from all other diseases一viz., that no physician can cure it.
Now, upon the most diligent enquiry into the former lives of these two brothers, I find, besides the cursed and hellish maxim of policy above mentioned, another reason for the captain's conduct: the captain, besides what we have before said of him, was a man of great pride and fierceness, and had always treated his brother, who was of a different complexion, and greatly deficient in both these qualities, with the utmost air of superiority. The doctor, however, had much the larger share of learning, and was by many reputed to have the better understanding. This the captain knew, and could not bear; for though envy is at best a very malignant passion, yet is its bitterness greatly heightened by mixing with contempt towards the same object; and very much afraid I am, that whenever an obligation is joined to these two, indignation and not gratitude will be the product of all three.

Showing what kind of a history this is; what it is like, and what it is not like.
Though we have properly enough entitled this our work, a history, and not a life; nor an apology for a life, as is more in fashion; yet we intend in it rather to pursue the method of those writers, who profess to disclose the revolutions of countries, than to imitate the painful and voluminous historian, who, to preserve the regularity of his series, thinks himself obliged to fill up as much paper with the detail of months and years in which nothing remarkable happened, as he employs upon those notable aeras when the greatest scenes have been transacted on the human stage.
Such histories as these do, in reality, very much resemble a newspaper, which consists of just the same number of words, whether there be any news in it or not. They may likewise be compared to a stage coach, which performs constantly the same course, empty as well as full. The writer, indeed, seems to think himself obliged to keep even pace with time, whose amanuensis he is; and, like his master, travels as slowly through centuries of monkish dulness, when the world seems to have been asleep, as through that bright and busy age so nobly distinguished by the excellent Latin poet一
Ad confligendum venientibus undique poenis, Omnia cum belli trepido con-cussa tumultu Horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris; In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum Omnibus humanis esset, terraque marique.
Of which we wish we could give our readers a more adequate translation than that by Mr Creech一
When dreadful Carthage frighted Rome with arms, And all the world was shook with fierce alarms; Whilst undecided yet, which part should fall, Which nation rise the glorious lord of all.
Now it is our purpose, in the ensuing pages, to pursue a contrary method. When any extraordinary scene presents itself (as we trust will
53
often be the case), we shall spare no pains nor paper to open it at large to our reader; but if whole years should pass without producing anything worthy his notice, we shall not be afraid of a chasm in our history; but shall hasten on to matters of consequence, and leave such periods of time totally unobserved.
These are indeed to be considered as blanks in the grand lottery of time. We therefore, who are the registers of that lottery, shall imitate those sagacious persons who deal in that which is drawn at Guildhall, and who never trouble the public with the many blanks they dispose of; but when a great prize happens to be drawn, the newspapers are presently filled with it, and the world is sure to be informed at whose office it was sold: indeed, commonly two or three different offices lay claim to the honour of having disposed of it; by which, I suppose, the adventurers are given to understand that certain brokers are in the secrets of Fortune, and indeed of her cabinet council.
My reader then is not to be surprized, if, in the course of this work, he shall find some chapters very short, and others altogether as long; some that contain only the time of a single day, and others that comprise years; in a word, if my history sometimes seems to stand still, and sometimes to fly. For all which I shall not look on myself as accountable to any court of critical jurisdiction whatever: for as I am, in reality, the founder of a new province of writing, so I am at liberty to make what laws I please therein. And these laws, my readers, whom I consider as my subjects, are bound to believe in and to obey; with which that they may readily and cheerfully comply, I do hereby assure them that I shall principally regard their ease and advantage in all such institutions: for I do not, like a jure divino tyrant, imagine that they are my slaves, or my commodity. I am, indeed, set over them for their own good only, and was created for their use, and not they for mine. Nor do I doubt, while I make their interest the great rule of my writings, they will unanimously concur in supporting my dignity, and in rendering me all the honour I shall deserve or desire.

Religious cautions against showing too much favour to bastards; and a great discovery made by Mrs Deborah Wilkins.
Eight months after the celebration of the nuptials between Captain Bli-fil and Miss Bridget Allworthy, a young lady of great beauty, merit, and fortune, was Miss Bridget, by reason of a fright, delivered of a fine boy. The child was indeed to all appearances perfect; but the midwife discovered it was born a month before its full time.
Though the birth of an heir by his beloved sister was a circumstance of great joy to Mr Allworthy, yet it did not alienate his affections from the little foundling, to whom he had been godfather, had given his own name of Thomas, and whom he had hitherto seldom failed of visiting, at least once a day, in his nursery.
He told his sister, if she pleased, the new-born infant should be bred up together with little Tommy; to which she consented, though with some little reluctance: for she had truly a great complacence for her brother; and hence she had always behaved towards the foundling with rather more kindness than ladies of rigid virtue can sometimes bring themselves to show to these children, who, however innocent, may be truly called the living monuments of incontinence.
The captain could not so easily bring himself to bear what he condemned as a fault in Mr Allworthy. He gave him frequent hints, that to adopt the fruits of sin, was to give countenance to it. He quoted several texts (for he was well read in Scripture), such as, He visits the sins of the fathers upon the children; and the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge,&amp;c. Whence he argued the legality of punishing the crime of the parent on the bastard. He said, "Though the law did not positively allow the destroying such base-born children, yet it held them to be the children of nobody; that the Church considered them as the children of nobody; and that at the best, they ought to be brought up to the lowest and vilest offices of the commonwealth."
55
Mr Allworthy answered to all this, and much more, which the captain had urged on this subject, "That, however guilty the parents might be, the children were certainly innocent: that as to the texts he had quoted, the former of them was a particular denunciation against the Jews, for the sin of idolatry, of relinquishing and hating their heavenly King; and the latter was parabolically spoken, and rather intended to denote the certain and necessary consequences of sin, than any express judgment against it. But to represent the Almighty as avenging the sins of the guilty on the innocent, was indecent, if not blasphemous, as it was to represent him acting against the first principles of natural justice, and against the original notions of right and wrong, which he himself had implanted in our minds; by which we were to judge not only in all matters which were not revealed, but even of the truth of revelation itself. He said he knew many held the same principles with the captain on this head; but he was himself firmly convinced to the contrary, and would provide in the same manner for this poor infant, as if a legitimate child had had fortune to have been found in the same place."
While the captain was taking all opportunities to press these and such like arguments, to remove the little foundling from Mr Allworthy's, of whose fondness for him he began to be jealous, Mrs Deborah had made a discovery, which, in its event, threatened at least to prove more fatal to poor Tommy than all the reasonings of the captain.
Whether the insatiable curiosity of this good woman had carried her on to that business, or whether she did it to confirm herself in the good graces of Mrs Blifil, who, notwithstanding her outward behaviour to the foundling, frequently abused the infant in private, and her brother too, for his fondness to it, I will not determine; but she had now, as she conceived, fully detected the father of the foundling.
Now, as this was a discovery of great consequence, it may be necessary to trace it from the fountain-head. We shall therefore very minutely lay open those previous matters by which it was produced; and for that purpose we shall be obliged to reveal all the secrets of a little family with which my reader is at present entirely unacquainted; and of which the oeconomy was so rare and extraordinary, that I fear it will shock the utmost credulity of many married persons.

Chapter U
The description of a domestic government founded upon rules directly contrary to those of Aristotle.
My reader may please to remember he hath been informed that Jenny Jones had lived some years with a certain schoolmaster, who had, at her earnest desire, instructed her in Latin, in which, to do justice to her genius, she had so improved herself, that she was become a better scholar than her master.
Indeed, though this poor man had undertaken a profession to which learning must be allowed necessary, this was the least of his commendations. He was one of the best-natured fellows in the world, and was, at the same time, master of so much pleasantry and humour, that he was reputed the wit of the country; and all the neighbouring gentlemen were so desirous of his company, that as denying was not his talent, he spent much time at their houses, which he might, with more emolument, have spent in his school.
It may be imagined that a gentleman so qualified and so disposed, was in no danger of becoming formidable to the learned seminaries of Eton or Westminster. To speak plainly, his scholars were divided into two classes: in the upper of which was a young gentleman, the son of a neighbouring squire, who, at the age of seventeen, was just entered into his Syntaxis; and in the lower was a second son of the same gentleman, who, together with seven parish-boys, was learning to read and write.
The stipend arising hence would hardly have indulged the schoolmaster in the luxuries of life, had he not added to this office those of clerk and barber, and had not Mr Allworthy added to the whole an annuity of ten pounds, which the poor man received every Christmas, and with which he was enabled to cheer his heart during that sacred festival.
Among his other treasures, the pedagogue had a wife, whom he had married out of Mr Allworthy's kitchen for her fortune, viz., twenty pounds, which she had there amassed.
57
This woman was not very amiable in her person. Whether she sat to my friend Hogarth, or no, I will not determine; but she exactly resembled the young woman who is pouring out her mistress's tea in the third picture of the Harlot's Progress. She was, besides, a profest follower of that noble sect founded by Xantippe of old; by means of which she became more formidable in the school than her husband; for, to confess the truth, he was never master there, or anywhere else, in her presence.
Though her countenance did not denote much natural sweetness of temper, yet this was, perhaps, somewhat soured by a circumstance which generally poisons matrimonial felicity; for children are rightly called the pledges of love; and her husband, though they had been married nine years, had given her no such pledges; a default for which he had no excuse, either from age or health, being not yet thirty years old, and what they call a jolly brisk young man.
Hence arose another evil, which produced no little uneasiness to the poor pedagogue, of whom she maintained so constant a jealousy, that he durst hardly speak to one woman in the parish; for the least degree of civility, or even correspondence, with any female, was sure to bring his wife upon her back, and his own.
In order to guard herself against matrimonial injuries in her own house, as she kept one maid-servant, she always took care to chuse her out of that order of females whose faces are taken as a kind of security for their virtue; of which number Jenny Jones, as the reader hath been before informed, was one.
As the face of this young woman might be called pretty good security of the before-mentioned kind, and as her behaviour had been always extremely modest, which is the certain consequence of understanding in women; she had passed above four years at Mr Partridge's (for that was the schoolmaster's name) without creating the least suspicion in her mistress. Nay, she had been treated with uncommon kindness, and her mistress had permitted Mr Partridge to give her those instructions which have been before commemorated.
But it is with jealousy as with the gout: when such distempers are in the blood, there is never any security against their breaking out; and that often on the slightest occasions, and when least suspected.
Thus it happened to Mrs Partridge, who had submitted four years to her husband's teaching this young woman, and had suffered her often to neglect her work, in order to pursue her learning. For, passing by one day, as the girl was reading, and her master leaning over her, the girl, I
58
know not for what reason, suddenly started up from her chair: and this was the first time that suspicion ever entered into the head of her mistress. This did not, however, at that time discover itself, but lay lurking in her mind, like a concealed enemy, who waits for a reinforcement of additional strength before he openly declares himself and proceeds upon hostile operations: and such additional strength soon arrived to corroborate her suspicion; for not long after, the husband and wife being at dinner, the master said to his maid, Da mihi aliquid potum: upon which the poor girl smiled, perhaps at the badness of the Latin, and, when her mistress cast her eyes on her, blushed, possibly with a consciousness of having laughed at her master. Mrs Partridge, upon this, immediately fell into a fury, and discharged the trencher on which she was eating, at the head of poor Jenny, crying out, "You impudent whore, do you play tricks with my husband before my face?" and at the same instant rose from her chair with a knife in her hand, with which, most probably, she would have executed very tragical vengeance, had not the girl taken the advantage of being nearer the door than her mistress, and avoided her fury by running away: for, as to the poor husband, whether surprize had rendered him motionless, or fear (which is full as probable) had restrained him from venturing at any opposition, he sat staring and trembling in his chair; nor did he once offer to move or speak, till his wife, returning from the pursuit of Jenny, made some defensive measures necessary for his own preservation; and he likewise was obliged to retreat, after the example of the maid.
This good woman was, no more than Othello, of a disposition
To make a life of jealousy And follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions一
With her, as well as him,
一To be once in doubt, Was once to be resolvd一
she therefore ordered Jenny immediately to pack up her alls and begone, for that she was determined she should not sleep that night within her walls.
Mr Partridge had profited too much by experience to interpose in a matter of this nature. He therefore had recourse to his usual receipt of patience, for, though he was not a great adept in Latin, he remembered, and well understood, the advice contained in these words
一Leve fit quod bene fertur onus in English:
A burden becomes lightest when it is well borne—
59
which he had always in his mouth; and of which, to say the truth, he had often occasion to experience the truth.
Jenny offered to make protestations of her innocence; but the tempest was too strong for her to be heard. She then betook herself to the business of packing, for which a small quantity of brown paper sufficed, and, having received her small pittance of wages, she returned home.
The schoolmaster and his consort passed their time unpleasantly enough that evening, but something or other happened before the next morning, which a little abated the fury of Mrs Partridge; and she at length admitted her husband to make his excuses: to which she gave the readier belief, as he had, instead of desiring her to recall Jenny, professed a satisfaction in her being dismissed, saying, she was grown of little use as a servant, spending all her time in reading, and was become, moreover, very pert and obstinate; for, indeed, she and her master had lately had frequent disputes in literature; in which, as hath been said, she was become greatly his superior. This, however, he would by no means allow; and as he called her persisting in the right, obstinacy, he began to hate her with no small inveteracy.
60
Containing one of the most bloody battles, or rather duels, that were ever recorded in domestic history.
For the reasons mentioned in the preceding chapter, and from some other matrimonial concessions, well known to most husbands, and which, like the secrets of freemasonry, should be divulged to none who are not members of that honourable fraternity, Mrs Partridge was pretty well satisfied that she had condemned her husband without cause, and endeavoured by acts of kindness to make him amends for her false suspicion. Her passions were indeed equally violent, whichever way they inclined; for as she could be extremely angry, so could she be altogether as fond.
But though these passions ordinarily succeed each other, and scarce twenty-four hours ever passed in which the pedagogue was not, in some degree, the object of both; yet, on extraordinary occasions, when the passion of anger had raged very high, the remission was usually longer: and so was the case at present; for she continued longer in a state of affability, after this fit of jealousy was ended, than her husband had ever known before: and, had it not been for some little exercises, which all the followers of Xantippe are obliged to perform daily, Mr Partridge would have enjoyed a perfect serenity of several months.
Perfect calms at sea are always suspected by the experienced mariner to be the forerunners of a storm, and I know some persons, who, without being generally the devotees of superstition, are apt to apprehend that great and unusual peace or tranquillity will be attended with its opposite. For which reason the antients used, on such occasions, to sacrifice to the goddess Nemesis, a deity who was thought by them to look with an invidious eye on human felicity, and to have a peculiar delight in overturning it.
As we are very far from believing in any such heathen goddess, or from encouraging any superstition, so we wish Mr John Fr-------, or some
61
other such philosopher, would bestir himself a little, in order to find out the real cause of this sudden transition from good to bad fortune, which hath been so often remarked, and of which we shall proceed to give an instance; for it is our province to relate facts, and we shall leave causes to persons of much higher genius.
Mankind have always taken great delight in knowing and descanting on the actions of others. Hence there have been, in all ages and nations, certain places set apart for public rendezvous, where the curious might meet and satisfy their mutual curiosity. Among these, the barbers' shops have justly borne the pre-eminence. Among the Greeks, barbers' news was a proverbial expression; and Horace, in one of his epistles, makes honourable mention of the Roman barbers in the same light.
Those of England are known to be no wise inferior to their Greek or Roman predecessors. You there see foreign affairs discussed in a manner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the coffee-houses; and domestic occurrences are much more largely and freely treated in the former than in the latter. But this serves only for the men. Now, whereas the females of this country, especially those of the lower order, do associate themselves much more than those of other nations, our polity would be highly deficient, if they had not some place set apart likewise for the indulgence of their curiosity, seeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half of the species.
In enjoying, therefore, such place of rendezvous, the British fair ought to esteem themselves more happy than any of their foreign sisters; as I do not remember either to have read in history, or to have seen in my travels, anything of the like kind.
This place then is no other than the chandler's shop, the known seat of all the news; or, as it is vulgarly called, gossiping, in every parish in England.
Mrs Partridge being one day at this assembly of females, was asked by one of her neighbours, if she had heard no news lately of Jenny Jones? To which she answered in the negative. Upon this the other replied, with a smile, That the parish was very much obliged to her for having turned Jenny away as she did.
Mrs Partridge, whose jealousy, as the reader well knows, was long since cured, and who had no other quarrel to her maid, answered boldly, She did not know any obligation the parish had to her on that account; for she believed Jenny had scarce left her equal behind her.
62
"No, truly," said the gossip, "I hope not, though I fancy we have sluts enow too. Then you have not heard, it seems, that she hath been brought to bed of two bastards? but as they are not born here, my husband and the other overseer says we shall not be obliged to keep them."
"Two bastards!" answered Mrs Partridge hastily: "you surprize me! I don't know whether we must keep them; but I am sure they must have been begotten here, for the wench hath not been nine months gone away."
Nothing can be so quick and sudden as the operations of the mind, especially when hope, or fear, or jealousy, to which the two others are but journeymen, set it to work. It occurred instantly to her, that Jenny had scarce ever been out of her own house while she lived with her. The leaning over the chair, the sudden starting up, the Latin, the smile, and many other things, rushed upon her all at once. The satisfaction her husband expressed in the departure of Jenny, appeared now to be only dissembled; again, in the same instant, to be real; but yet to confirm her jealousy, proceeding from satiety, and a hundred other bad causes. In a word, she was convinced of her husband's guilt, and immediately left the assembly in confusion.
As fair Grimalkin, who, though the youngest of the feline family, degenerates not in ferocity from the elder branches of her house, and though inferior in strength, is equal in fierceness to the noble tiger himself, when a little mouse, whom it hath long tormented in sport, escapes from her clutches for a while, frets, scolds, growls, swears; but if the trunk, or box, behind which the mouse lay hid be again removed, she flies like lightning on her prey, and, with envenomed wrath, bites, scratches, mumbles, and tears the little animal.
Not with less fury did Mrs Partridge fly on the poor pedagogue. Her tongue, teeth, and hands, fell all upon him at once. His wig was in an instant torn from his head, his shirt from his back, and from his face descended five streams of blood, denoting the number of claws with which nature had unhappily armed the enemy.
Mr Partridge acted for some time on the defensive only; indeed he attempted only to guard his face with his hands; but as he found that his antagonist abated nothing of her rage, he thought he might, at least, endeavour to disarm her, or rather to confine her arms; in doing which her cap fell off in the struggle, and her hair being too short to reach her shoulders, erected itself on her head; her stays likewise, which were laced through one single hole at the bottom, burst open; and her breasts,
63
which were much more redundant than her hair, hung down below her middle; her face was likewise marked with the blood of her husband: her teeth gnashed with rage; and fire, such as sparkles from a smith's forge, darted from her eyes. So that, altogether, this Amazonian heroine might have been an object of terror to a much bolder man than Mr Partridge.
He had, at length, the good fortune, by getting possession of her arms, to render those weapons which she wore at the ends of her fingers useless; which she no sooner perceived, than the softness of her sex prevailed over her rage, and she presently dissolved in tears, which soon after concluded in a fit.
That small share of sense which Mr Partridge had hitherto preserved through this scene of fury, of the cause of which he was hitherto ignorant, now utterly abandoned him. He ran instantly into the street, hallowing out that his wife was in the agonies of death, and beseeching the neighbours to fly with the utmost haste to her assistance. Several good women obeyed his summons, who entering his house, and applying the usual remedies on such occasions, Mrs Partridge was at length, to the great joy of her husband, brought to herself.
As soon as she had a little recollected her spirits, and somewhat composed herself with a cordial, she began to inform the company of the manifold injuries she had received from her husband; who, she said, was not contented to injure her in her bed; but, upon her upbraiding him with it, had treated her in the cruelest manner imaginable; had tore her cap and hair from her head, and her stays from her body, giving her, at the same time, several blows, the marks of which she should carry to the grave.
The poor man, who bore on his face many more visible marks of the indignation of his wife, stood in silent astonishment at this accusation; which the reader will, I believe, bear witness for him, had greatly exceeded the truth; for indeed he had not struck her once; and this silence being interpreted to be a confession of the charge by the whole court, they all began at once, una voce, to rebuke and revile him, repeating often, that none but a coward ever struck a woman.
Mr Partridge bore all this patiently; but when his wife appealed to the blood on her face, as an evidence of his barbarity, he could not help laying claim to his own blood, for so it really was; as he thought it very unnatural, that this should rise up (as we are taught that of a murdered person often doth) in vengeance against him.
64
To this the women made no other answer, than that it was a pity it had not come from his heart, instead of his face; all declaring, that, if their husbands should lift their hands against them, they would have their hearts' bloods out of their bodies.
After much admonition for what was past, and much good advice to Mr Partridge for his future behaviour, the company at length departed, and left the husband and wife to a personal conference together, in which Mr Partridge soon learned the cause of all his sufferings.

Chapter U
Containing much matter to exercise the judgment and reflection of the reader.
I believe it is a true observation, that few secrets are divulged to one person only; but certainly, it would be next to a miracle that a fact of this kind should be known to a whole parish, and not transpire any farther.
And, indeed, a very few days had past, before the country, to use a common phrase, rung of the schoolmaster of Little Baddington; who was said to have beaten his wife in the most cruel manner. Nay, in some places it was reported he had murdered her; in others, that he had broke her arms; in others, her legs: in short, there was scarce an injury which can be done to a human creature, but what Mrs Partridge was somewhere or other affirmed to have received from her husband.
The cause of this quarrel was likewise variously reported; for as some people said that Mrs Partridge had caught her husband in bed with his maid, so many other reasons, of a very different kind, went abroad. Nay, some transferred the guilt to the wife, and the jealousy to the husband.
Mrs Wilkins had long ago heard of this quarrel; but, as a different cause from the true one had reached her ears, she thought proper to conceal it; and the rather, perhaps, as the blame was universally laid on Mr Partridge; and his wife, when she was servant to Mr Allworthy, had in something offended Mrs Wilkins, who was not of a very forgiving temper.
But Mrs Wilkins, whose eyes could see objects at a distance, and who could very well look forward a few years into futurity, had perceived a strong likelihood of Captain Blifil's being hereafter her master; and as she plainly discerned that the captain bore no great goodwill to the little foundling, she fancied it would be rendering him an agreeable service, if she could make any discoveries that might lessen the affection which Mr Allworthy seemed to have contracted for this child, and which gave visible uneasiness to the captain, who could not entirely conceal it even
66
before Allworthy himself; though his wife, who acted her part much better in public, frequently recommended to him her own example, of conniving at the folly of her brother, which, she said, she at least as well perceived, and as much resented, as any other possibly could.
Mrs Wilkins having therefore, by accident, gotten a true scent of the above story,一though long after it had happened, failed not to satisfy herself thoroughly of all the particulars; and then acquainted the captain, that she had at last discovered the true father of the little bastard, which she was sorry, she said, to see her master lose his reputation in the country, by taking so much notice of.
The captain chid her for the conclusion of her speech, as an improper assurance in judging of her master's actions: for if his honour, or his understanding, would have suffered the captain to make an alliance with Mrs Wilkins, his pride would by no means have admitted it. And to say the truth, there is no conduct less politic, than to enter into any confederacy with your friend's servants against their master: for by these means you afterwards become the slave of these very servants; by whom you are constantly liable to be betrayed. And this consideration, perhaps it was, which prevented Captain Blifil from being more explicit with Mrs Wilkins, or from encouraging the abuse which she had bestowed on Allworthy.
But though he declared no satisfaction to Mrs Wilkins at this discovery, he enjoyed not a little from it in his own mind, and resolved to make the best use of it he was able.
He kept this matter a long time concealed within his own breast, in hopes that Mr Allworthy might hear it from some other person; but Mrs Wilkins, whether she resented the captain's behaviour, or whether his cunning was beyond her, and she feared the discovery might displease him, never afterwards opened her lips about the matter.
I have thought it somewhat strange, upon reflection, that the housekeeper never acquainted Mrs Blifil with this news, as women are more inclined to communicate all pieces of intelligence to their own sex, than to ours. The only way, as it appears to me, of solving this difficulty, is, by imputing it to that distance which was now grown between the lady and the housekeeper: whether this arose from a jealousy in Mrs Blifil, that Wilkins showed too great a respect to the foundling; for while she was endeavouring to ruin the little infant, in order to ingratiate herself with the captain, she was every day more and more commending it before Allworthy, as his fondness for it every day increased. This,
67
notwithstanding all the care she took at other times to express the direct contrary to Mrs Blifil, perhaps offended that delicate lady, who certainly now hated Mrs Wilkins; and though she did not, or possibly could not, absolutely remove her from her place, she found, however, the means of making her life very uneasy. This Mrs Wilkins, at length, so resented, that she very openly showed all manner of respect and fondness to little Tommy, in opposition to Mrs Blifil.
The captain, therefore, finding the story in danger of perishing, at last took an opportunity to reveal it himself.
He was one day engaged with Mr Allworthy in a discourse on charity: in which the captain, with great learning, proved to Mr Allworthy, that the word charity in Scripture nowhere means beneficence or generosity.
"The Christian religion," he said, "was instituted for much nobler purposes, than to enforce a lesson which many heathen philosophers had taught us long before, and which, though it might perhaps be called a moral virtue, savoured but little of that sublime, Christian-like disposition, that vast elevation of thought, in purity approaching to angelic perfection, to be attained, expressed, and felt only by grace. Those," he said, "came nearer to the Scripture meaning, who understood by it candour, or the forming of a benevolent opinion of our brethren, and passing a favourable judgment on their actions; a virtue much higher, and more extensive in its nature, than a pitiful distribution of alms, which, though we would never so much prejudice, or even ruin our families, could never reach many; whereas charity, in the other and truer sense, might be extended to all mankind."
He said, "Considering who the disciples were, it would be absurd to conceive the doctrine of generosity, or giving alms, to have been preached to them. And, as we could not well imagine this doctrine should be preached by its Divine Author to men who could not practise it, much less should we think it understood so by those who can practise it, and do not.
"But though," continued he, "there is, I am afraid, little merit in these benefactions, there would, I must confess, be much pleasure in them to a good mind, if it was not abated by one consideration. I mean, that we are liable to be imposed upon, and to confer our choicest favours often on the undeserving, as you must own was your case in your bounty to that worthless fellow Partridge: for two or three such examples must greatly lessen the inward satisfaction which a good man would otherwise find in generosity; nay, may even make him timorous in bestowing, lest he
68
should be guilty of supporting vice, and encouraging the wicked; a crime of a very black dye, and for which it will by no means be a sufficient excuse, that we have not actually intended such an encouragement; unless we have used the utmost caution in chusing the objects of our beneficence. A consideration which, I make no doubt, hath greatly checked the liberality of many a worthy and pious man."
Mr Allworthy answered, "He could not dispute with the captain in the Greek language, and therefore could say nothing as to the true sense of the word which is translated charity; but that he had always thought it was interpreted to consist in action, and that giving alms constituted at least one branch of that virtue.
"As to the meritorious part," he said, "he readily agreed with the captain; for where could be the merit of barely discharging a duty? which," he said, "let the word charity have what construction it would, it sufficiently appeared to be from the whole tenor of the New Testament. And as he thought it an indispensable duty, enjoined both by the Christian law, and by the law of nature itself; so was it withal so pleasant, that if any duty could be said to be its own reward, or to pay us while we are discharging it, it was this.
"To confess the truth," said he, "there is one degree of generosity (of charity I would have called it), which seems to have some show of merit, and that is, where, from a principle of benevolence and Christian love, we bestow on another what we really want ourselves; where, in order to lessen the distresses of another, we condescend to share some part of them, by giving what even our own necessities cannot well spare. This is, I think, meritorious; but to relieve our brethren only with our superfluities; to be charitable (I must use the word) rather at the expense of our coffers than ourselves; to save several families from misery rather than hang up an extraordinary picture in our houses or gratify any other idle ridiculous vanity一this seems to be only being human creatures. Nay, I will venture to go farther, it is being in some degree epicures: for what could the greatest epicure wish rather than to eat with many mouths instead of one? which I think may be predicated of any one who knows that the bread of many is owing to his own largesses.
"As to the apprehension of bestowing bounty on such as may hereafter prove unworthy objects, because many have proved such; surely it can never deter a good man from generosity. I do not think a few or many examples of ingratitude can justify a man's hardening his heart against the distresses of his fellow-creatures; nor do I believe it can ever have
69
such effect on a truly benevolent mind. Nothing less than a persuasion of universal depravity can lock up the charity of a good man; and this persuasion must lead him, I think, either into atheism, or enthusiasm; but surely it is unfair to argue such universal depravity from a few vicious individuals; nor was this, I believe, ever done by a man, who, upon searching his own mind, found one certain exception to the general rule." He then concluded by asking, "who that Partridge was, whom he had called a worthless fellow?"
"I mean," said the captain, "Partridge the barber, the schoolmaster, what do you call him? Partridge, the father of the little child which you found in your bed."
Mr Allworthy exprest great surprize at this account, and the captain as great at his ignorance of it; for he said he had known it above a month: and at length recollected with much difficulty that he was told it by Mrs Wilkins.
Upon this, Wilkins was immediately summoned; who having confirmed what the captain had said, was by Mr Allworthy, by and with the captain's advice, dispatched to Little Baddington, to inform herself of the truth of the fact: for the captain exprest great dislike at all hasty proceedings in criminal matters, and said he would by no means have Mr Allworthy take any resolution either to the prejudice of the child or its father, before he was satisfied that the latter was guilty; for though he had privately satisfied himself of this from one of Partridge's neighbours, yet he was too generous to give any such evidence to Mr Allworthy.
70
CT6
The trial of Partridge, the schoolmaster, for incontinency; the evidence of his wife; a short reflection on the wisdom of our law; with other grave matters, which those will like best who understand them most.
It may be wondered that a story so well known, and which had furnished so much matter of conversation, should never have been mentioned to Mr Allworthy himself, who was perhaps the only person in that country who had never heard of it.
To account in some measure for this to the reader, I think proper to inform him, that there was no one in the kingdom less interested in opposing that doctrine concerning the meaning of the word charity, which hath been seen in the preceding chapter, than our good man. Indeed, he was equally intitled to this virtue in either sense; for as no man was ever more sensible of the wants, or more ready to relieve the distresses of others, so none could be more tender of their characters, or slower to believe anything to their disadvantage.
Scandal, therefore, never found any access to his table; for as it hath been long since observed that you may know a man by his companions, so I will venture to say, that, by attending to the conversation at a great man's table, you may satisfy yourself of his religion, his politics, his taste, and indeed of his entire disposition: for though a few odd fellows will utter their own sentiments in all places, yet much the greater part of mankind have enough of the courtier to accommodate their conversation to the taste and inclination of their superiors.
But to return to Mrs Wilkins, who, having executed her commission with great dispatch, though at fifteen miles distance, brought back such a confirmation of the schoolmaster's guilt, that Mr Allworthy determined to send for the criminal, and examine him viva voce. Mr Partridge, therefore, was summoned to attend, in order to his defence (if he could make any) against this accusation.
71
At the time appointed, before Mr Allworthy himself, at Paradise-hall, came as well the said Partridge, with Anne, his wife, as Mrs Wilkins his accuser.
And now Mr Allworthy being seated in the chair of justice, Mr Partridge was brought before him. Having heard his accusation from the mouth of Mrs Wilkins, he pleaded not guilty, making many vehement protestations of his innocence.
Mrs Partridge was then examined, who, after a modest apology for being obliged to speak the truth against her husband, related all the circumstances with which the reader hath already been acquainted; and at last concluded with her husband's confession of his guilt.
Whether she had forgiven him or no, I will not venture to determine; but it is certain she was an unwilling witness in this cause; and it is probable from certain other reasons, would never have been brought to depose as she did, had not Mrs Wilkins, with great art, fished all out of her at her own house, and had she not indeed made promises, in Mr Allworthy's name, that the punishment of her husband should not be such as might anywise affect his family.
Partridge still persisted in asserting his innocence, though he admitted he had made the above-mentioned confession; which he however endeavoured to account for, by protesting that he was forced into it by the continued importunity she used: who vowed, that, as she was sure of his guilt, she would never leave tormenting him till he had owned it; and faithfully promised, that, in such case, she would never mention it to him more. Hence, he said, he had been induced falsely to confess himself guilty, though he was innocent; and that he believed he should have con-fest a murder from the same motive.
Mrs Partridge could not bear this imputation with patience; and having no other remedy in the present place but tears, she called forth a plentiful assistance from them, and then addressing herself to Mr Allworthy, she said (or rather cried), "May it please your worship, there never was any poor woman so injured as I am by that base man; for this is not the only instance of his falsehood to me. No, may it please your worship, he hath injured my bed many's the good time and often. I could have put up with his drunkenness and neglect of his business, if he had not broke one of the sacred commandments. Besides, if it had been out of doors I had not mattered it so much; but with my own servant, in my own house, under my own roof, to defile my own chaste bed, which to be sure he hath, with his beastly stinking whores. Yes, you villain, you

have defiled my own bed, you have; and then you have charged me with bullocking you into owning the truth. It is very likely, an't please your worship, that I should bullock him? I have marks enow about my body to show of his cruelty to me. If you had been a man, you villain, you would have scorned to injure a woman in that manner. But you an't half a man, you know it. Nor have you been half a husband to me. You need run after whores, you need, when I'm sure一And since he provokes me, I am ready, an't please your worship, to take my bodily oath that I found them a-bed together. What, you have forgot, I suppose, when you beat me into a fit, and made the blood run down my forehead, because I only civilly taxed you with adultery! but I can prove it by all my neighbours. You have almost broke my heart, you have, you have."
Here Mr Allworthy interrupted, and begged her to be pacified, promising her that she should have justice; then turning to Partridge, who stood aghast, one half of his wits being hurried away by surprize and the other half by fear, he said he was sorry to see there was so wicked a man in the world. He assured him that his prevaricating and lying backward and forward was a great aggravation of his guilt; for which the only atonement he could make was by confession and repentance. He exhorted him, therefore, to begin by immediately confessing the fact, and not to persist in denying what was so plainly proved against him even by his own wife.
Here, reader, I beg your patience a moment, while I make a just compliment to the great wisdom and sagacity of our law, which refuses to admit the evidence of a wife for or against her husband. This, says a certain learned author, who, I believe, was never quoted before in any but a law-book, would be the means of creating an eternal dissension between them. It would, indeed, be the means of much perjury, and of much whipping, fining, imprisoning, transporting, and hanging.
Partridge stood a while silent, till, being bid to speak, he said he had already spoken the truth, and appealed to Heaven for his innocence, and lastly to the girl herself, whom he desired his worship immediately to send for; for he was ignorant, or at least pretended to be so, that she had left that part of the country.
Mr Allworthy, whose natural love of justice, joined to his coolness of temper, made him always a most patient magistrate in hearing all the witnesses which an accused person could produce in his defence, agreed to defer his final determination of this matter till the arrival of Jenny, for whom he immediately dispatched a messenger; and then having
73
recommended peace between Partridge and his wife (though he addressed himself chiefly to the wrong person), he appointed them to attend again the third day; for he had sent Jenny a whole day's journey from his own house.
At the appointed time the parties all assembled, when the messenger returning brought word, that Jenny was not to be found; for that she had left her habitation a few days before, in company with a recruiting officer.
Mr Allworthy then declared that the evidence of such a slut as she appeared to be would have deserved no credit; but he said he could not help thinking that, had she been present, and would have declared the truth, she must have confirmed what so many circumstances, together with his own confession, and the declaration of his wife that she had caught her husband in the fact, did sufficiently prove. He therefore once more exhorted Partridge to confess; but he still avowing his innocence, Mr Allworthy declared himself satisfied of his guilt, and that he was too bad a man to receive any encouragement from him. He therefore deprived him of his annuity, and recommended repentance to him on account of another world, and industry to maintain himself and his wife in this.
There were not, perhaps, many more unhappy persons than poor Partridge. He had lost the best part of his income by the evidence of his wife, and yet was daily upbraided by her for having, among other things, been the occasion of depriving her of that benefit; but such was his fortune, and he was obliged to submit to it.
Though I called him poor Partridge in the last paragraph, I would have the reader rather impute that epithet to the compassion in my temper than conceive it to be any declaration of his innocence. Whether he was innocent or not will perhaps appear hereafter; but if the historic muse hath entrusted me with any secrets, I will by no means be guilty of discovering them till she shall give me leave.
Here therefore the reader must suspend his curiosity. Certain it is that, whatever was the truth of the case, there was evidence more than sufficient to convict him before Allworthy; indeed, much less would have satisfied a bench of justices on an order of bastardy; and yet, notwithstanding the positiveness of Mrs Partridge, who would have taken the sacrament upon the matter, there is a possibility that the schoolmaster was entirely innocent: for though it appeared clear on comparing the time when Jenny departed from Little Baddington with that of her delivery that she
74
had there conceived this infant, yet it by no means followed of necessity that Partridge must have been its father; for, to omit other particulars, there was in the same house a lad near eighteen, between whom and Jenny there had subsisted sufficient intimacy to found a reasonable suspicion; and yet, so blind is jealousy, this circumstance never once entered into the head of the enraged wife.
Whether Partridge repented or not, according to Mr Allworthy's advice, is not so apparent. Certain it is that his wife repented heartily of the evidence she had given against him: especially when she found Mrs Deborah had deceived her, and refused to make any application to Mr Allworthy on her behalf. She had, however, somewhat better success with Mrs Blifil, who was, as the reader must have perceived, a much better-tempered woman, and very kindly undertook to solicit her brother to restore the annuity; in which, though good-nature might have some share, yet a stronger and more natural motive will appear in the next chapter.
These solicitations were nevertheless unsuccessful: for though Mr Allworthy did not think, with some late writers, that mercy consists only in punishing offenders; yet he was as far from thinking that it is proper to this excellent quality to pardon great criminals wantonly, without any reason whatever. Any doubtfulness of the fact, or any circumstance of mitigation, was never disregarded: but the petitions of an offender, or the intercessions of others, did not in the least affect him. In a word, he never pardoned because the offender himself, or his friends, were unwilling that he should be punished.
Partridge and his wife were therefore both obliged to submit to their fate; which was indeed severe enough: for so far was he from doubling his industry on the account of his lessened income, that he did in a manner abandon himself to despair; and as he was by nature indolent, that vice now increased upon him, by which means he lost the little school he had; so that neither his wife nor himself would have had any bread to eat, had not the charity of some good Christian interposed, and provided them with what was just sufficient for their sustenance.
As this support was conveyed to them by an unknown hand, they imagined, and so, I doubt not, will the reader, that Mr Allworthy himself was their secret benefactor; who, though he would not openly encourage vice, could yet privately relieve the distresses of the vicious themselves, when these became too exquisite and disproportionate to their demerit. In which light their wretchedness appeared now to Fortune herself; for she at length took pity on this miserable couple, and considerably
75
lessened the wretched state of Partridge, by putting a final end to that of his wife, who soon after caught the small-pox, and died.
The justice which Mr Allworthy had executed on Partridge at first met with universal approbation; but no sooner had he felt its consequences, than his neighbours began to relent, and to compassionate his case; and presently after, to blame that as rigour and severity which they before called justice. They now exclaimed against punishing in cold blood, and sang forth the praises of mercy and forgiveness.
These cries were considerably increased by the death of Mrs Partridge, which, though owing to the distemper above mentioned, which is no consequence of poverty or distress, many were not ashamed to impute to Mr Allworthy's severity, or, as they now termed it, cruelty.
Partridge having now lost his wife, his school, and his annuity, and the unknown person having now discontinued the last-mentioned charity, resolved to change the scene, and left the country, where he was in danger of starving, with the universal compassion of all his neighbours.

Chapter /
A short sketch of that felicity which prudent couples may extract from hatred: with a short apology for those people who overlook imperfections in their friends.
Though the captain had effectually demolished poor Partridge, yet had he not reaped the harvest he hoped for, which was to turn the foundling out of Mr Allworthy's house.
On the contrary, that gentleman grew every day fonder of little Tommy, as if he intended to counterbalance his severity to the father with extraordinary fondness and affection towards the son.
This a good deal soured the captain's temper, as did all the other daily instances of Mr Allworthy's generosity; for he looked on all such largesses to be diminutions of his own wealth.
In this, we have said, he did not agree with his wife; nor, indeed, in anything else: for though an affection placed on the understanding is, by many wise persons, thought more durable than that which is founded on beauty, yet it happened otherwise in the present case. Nay, the understandings of this couple were their principal bone of contention, and one great cause of many quarrels, which from time to time arose between them; and which at last ended, on the side of the lady, in a sovereign contempt for her husband; and on the husband's, in an utter abhorrence of his wife.
As these had both exercised their talents chiefly in the study of divinity, this was, from their first acquaintance, the most common topic of conversation between them. The captain, like a well-bred man, had, before marriage, always given up his opinion to that of the lady; and this, not in the clumsy awkward manner of a conceited blockhead, who, while he civilly yields to a superior in an argument, is desirous of being still known to think himself in the right. The captain, on the contrary, though one of the proudest fellows in the world, so absolutely yielded the victory to his antagonist, that she, who had not the least doubt of his
77
sincerity, retired always from the dispute with an admiration of her own understanding and a love for his.
But though this complacence to one whom the captain thoroughly despised, was not so uneasy to him as it would have been had any hopes of preferment made it necessary to show the same submission to a Hoad-ley, or to some other of great reputation in the science, yet even this cost him too much to be endured without some motive. Matrimony, therefore, having removed all such motives, he grew weary of this condescension, and began to treat the opinions of his wife with that haughtiness and insolence, which none but those who deserve some contempt themselves can bestow, and those only who deserve no contempt can bear.
When the first torrent of tenderness was over, and when, in the calm and long interval between the fits, reason began to open the eyes of the lady, and she saw this alteration of behaviour in the captain, who at length answered all her arguments only with pish and pshaw, she was far from enduring the indignity with a tame submission. Indeed, it at first so highly provoked her, that it might have produced some tragical event, had it not taken a more harmless turn, by filling her with the utmost contempt for her husband's understanding, which somewhat qualified her hatred towards him; though of this likewise she had a pretty moderate share.
The captain's hatred to her was of a purer kind: for as to any imperfections in her knowledge or understanding, he no more despised her for them, than for her not being six feet high. In his opinion of the female sex, he exceeded the moroseness of Aristotle himself: he looked on a woman as on an animal of domestic use, of somewhat higher consideration than a cat, since her offices were of rather more importance; but the difference between these two was, in his estimation, so small, that, in his marriage contracted with Mr Allworthy's lands and tenements, it would have been pretty equal which of them he had taken into the bargain. And yet so tender was his pride, that it felt the contempt which his wife now began to express towards him; and this, added to the surfeit he had before taken of her love, created in him a degree of disgust and abhorrence, perhaps hardly to be exceeded.
One situation only of the married state is excluded from pleasure: and that is, a state of indifference: but as many of my readers, I hope, know what an exquisite delight there is in conveying pleasure to a beloved object, so some few, I am afraid, may have experienced the satisfaction of tormenting one we hate. It is, I apprehend, to come at this latter pleasure,
78
that we see both sexes often give up that ease in marriage which they might otherwise possess, though their mate was never so disagreeable to them. Hence the wife often puts on fits of love and jealousy, nay, even denies herself any pleasure, to disturb and prevent those of her husband; and he again, in return, puts frequent restraints on himself, and stays at home in company which he dislikes, in order to confine his wife to what she equally detests. Hence, too, must flow those tears which a widow sometimes so plentifully sheds over the ashes of a husband with whom she led a life of constant disquiet and turbulency, and whom now she can never hope to torment any more.
But if ever any couple enjoyed this pleasure, it was at present experienced by the captain and his lady. It was always a sufficient reason to either of them to be obstinate in any opinion, that the other had previously asserted the contrary. If the one proposed any amusement, the other constantly objected to it: they never loved or hated, commended or abused, the same person. And for this reason, as the captain looked with an evil eye on the little foundling, his wife began now to caress it almost equally with her own child.
The reader will be apt to conceive, that this behaviour between the husband and wife did not greatly contribute to Mr Allworthy's repose, as it tended so little to that serene happiness which he had designed for all three from this alliance; but the truth is, though he might be a little disappointed in his sanguine expectations, yet he was far from being acquainted with the whole matter; for, as the captain was, from certain obvious reasons, much on his guard before him, the lady was obliged, for fear of her brother's displeasure, to pursue the same conduct. In fact, it is possible for a third person to be very intimate, nay even to live long in the same house, with a married couple, who have any tolerable discretion, and not even guess at the sour sentiments which they bear to each other: for though the whole day may be sometimes too short for hatred, as well as for love; yet the many hours which they naturally spend together, apart from all observers, furnish people of tolerable moderation with such ample opportunity for the enjoyment of either passion, that, if they love, they can support being a few hours in company without toying, or if they hate, without spitting in each other's faces.
It is possible, however, that Mr Allworthy saw enough to render him a little uneasy; for we are not always to conclude, that a wise man is not hurt, because he doth not cry out and lament himself, like those of a childish or effeminate temper. But indeed it is possible he might see some faults in the captain without any uneasiness at all; for men of true
79
wisdom and goodness are contented to take persons and things as they are, without complaining of their imperfections, or attempting to amend them. They can see a fault in a friend, a relation, or an acquaintance, without ever mentioning it to the parties themselves, or to any others; and this often without lessening their affection. Indeed, unless great discernment be tempered with this overlooking disposition, we ought never to contract friendship but with a degree of folly which we can deceive; for I hope my friends will pardon me when I declare, I know none of them without a fault; and I should be sorry if I could imagine I had any friend who could not see mine. Forgiveness of this kind we give and demand in turn. It is an exercise of friendship, and perhaps none of the least pleasant. And this forgiveness we must bestow, without desire of amendment. There is, perhaps, no surer mark of folly, than an attempt to correct the natural infirmities of those we love. The finest composition of human nature, as well as the finest china, may have a flaw in it; and this, I am afraid, in either case, is equally incurable; though, nevertheless, the pattern may remain of the highest value.
Upon the whole, then, Mr Allworthy certainly saw some imperfections in the captain; but as this was a very artful man, and eternally upon his guard before him, these appeared to him no more than blemishes in a good character, which his goodness made him overlook, and his wisdom prevented him from discovering to the captain himself. Very different would have been his sentiments had he discovered the whole; which perhaps would in time have been the case, had the husband and wife long continued this kind of behaviour to each other; but this kind Fortune took effectual means to prevent, by forcing the captain to do that which rendered him again dear to his wife, and restored all her tenderness and affection towards him.

Chapter V?
A receipt to regain the lost affections of a wife, which hath never been known to fail in the most desperate cases.
The captain was made large amends for the unpleasant minutes which he passed in the conversation of his wife (and which were as few as he could contrive to make them), by the pleasant meditations he enjoyed when alone.
These meditations were entirely employed on Mr Allworthy's fortune; for, first, he exercised much thought in calculating, as well as he could, the exact value of the whole: which calculations he often saw occasion to alter in his own favour: and, secondly and chiefly, he pleased himself with intended alterations in the house and gardens, and in projecting many other schemes, as well for the improvement of the estate as of the grandeur of the place: for this purpose he applied himself to the studies of architecture and gardening, and read over many books on both these subjects; for these sciences, indeed, employed his whole time, and formed his only amusement. He at last completed a most excellent plan: and very sorry we are, that it is not in our power to present it to our reader, since even the luxury of the present age, I believe, would hardly match it. It had, indeed, in a superlative degree, the two principal ingredients which serve to recommend all great and noble designs of this nature; for it required an immoderate expense to execute, and a vast length of time to bring it to any sort of perfection. The former of these, the immense wealth of which the captain supposed Mr Allworthy possessed, and which he thought himself sure of inheriting, promised very effectually to supply; and the latter, the soundness of his own constitution, and his time of life, which was only what is called middle-age, removed all apprehension of his not living to accomplish.
Nothing was wanting to enable him to enter upon the immediate execution of this plan, but the death of Mr Allworthy; in calculating which he had employed much of his own algebra, besides purchasing every book extant that treats of the value of lives, reversions, &amp;c. From all
81
which he satisfied himself, that as he had every day a chance of this happening, so had he more than an even chance of its happening within a few years.
But while the captain was one day busied in deep contemplations of this kind, one of the most unlucky as well as unseasonable accidents happened to him. The utmost malice of Fortune could, indeed, have contrived nothing so cruel, so mal-a-propos, so absolutely destructive to all his schemes. In short, not to keep the reader in long suspense, just at the very instant when his heart was exulting in meditations on the happiness which would accrue to him by Mr Allworthy's death, he himself一died of an apoplexy.
This unfortunately befel the captain as he was taking his evening walk by himself, so that nobody was present to lend him any assistance, if indeed, any assistance could have preserved him. He took, therefore, measure of that proportion of soil which was now become adequate to all his future purposes, and he lay dead on the ground, a great (though not a living) example of the truth of that observation of Horace:
Tu secanda marmora Locas sub ipsum funus; et sepulchri Immemor, struis domos.
Which sentiment I shall thus give to the English reader: "You provide the noblest materials for building, when a pickaxe and a spade are only necessary: and build houses of five hundred by a hundred feet, forgetting that of six by two."

Chapter J
A proof of the infallibility of the foregoing receipt, in the lamentations of the widow; with other suitable decorations of death, such as physicians, &amp;c., and an epitaph in the true stile.
Mr Allworthy, his sister, and another lady, were assembled at the accustomed hour in the supper-room, where, having waited a considerable time longer than usual, Mr Allworthy first declared he began to grow uneasy at the captain's stay (for he was always most punctual at his meals); and gave orders that the bell should be rung without the doors, and especially towards those walks which the captain was wont to use.
All these summons proving ineffectual (for the captain had, by perverse accident, betaken himself to a new walk that evening), Mrs Blifil declared she was seriously frightened. Upon which the other lady, who was one of her most intimate acquaintance, and who well knew the true state of her affections, endeavoured all she could to pacify her, telling her一To be sure she could not help being uneasy; but that she should hope the best. That, perhaps the sweetness of the evening had inticed the captain to go farther than his usual walk: or he might be detained at some neighbour's. Mrs Blifil answered, No; she was sure some accident had befallen him; for that he would never stay out without sending her word, as he must know how uneasy it would make her. The other lady, having no other arguments to use, betook herself to the entreaties usual on such occasions, and begged her not to frighten herself, for it might be of very ill consequence to her own health; and, filling out a very large glass of wine, advised, and at last prevailed with her to drink it.
Mr Allworthy now returned into the parlour; for he had been himself in search after the captain. His countenance sufficiently showed the consternation he was under, which, indeed, had a good deal deprived him of speech; but as grief operates variously on different minds, so the same apprehension which depressed his voice, elevated that of Mrs Blifil. She now began to bewail herself in very bitter terms, and floods of tears accompanied her lamentations; which the lady, her companion, declared
83
she could not blame, but at the same time dissuaded her from indulging; attempting to moderate the grief of her friend by philosophical observations on the many disappointments to which human life is daily subject, which, she said, was a sufficient consideration to fortify our minds against any accidents, how sudden or terrible soever. She said her brother's example ought to teach her patience, who, though indeed he could not be supposed as much concerned as herself, yet was, doubtless, very uneasy, though his resignation to the Divine will had restrained his grief within due bounds.
"Mention not my brother," said Mrs Blifil; "I alone am the object of your pity. What are the terrors of friendship to what a wife feels on these occasions? Oh, he is lost! Somebody hath murdered him一I shall never see him more!"一Here a torrent of tears had the same consequence with what the suppression had occasioned to Mr Allworthy, and she remained silent.
At this interval a servant came running in, out of breath, and cried out, The captain was found; and, before he could proceed farther, he was followed by two more, bearing the dead body between them.
Here the curious reader may observe another diversity in the operations of grief: for as Mr Allworthy had been before silent, from the same cause which had made his sister vociferous; so did the present sight, which drew tears from the gentleman, put an entire stop to those of the lady; who first gave a violent scream, and presently after fell into a fit.
The room was soon full of servants, some of whom, with the lady visitant, were employed in care of the wife; and others, with Mr Allworthy, assisted in carrying off the captain to a warm bed; where every method was tried, in order to restore him to life.
And glad should we be, could we inform the reader that both these bodies had been attended with equal success; for those who undertook the care of the lady succeeded so well, that, after the fit had continued a decent time, she again revived, to their great satisfaction: but as to the captain, all experiments of bleeding, chafing, dropping, &amp;c., proved ineffectual. Death, that inexorable judge, had passed sentence on him, and refused to grant him a reprieve, though two doctors who arrived, and were fee'd at one and the same instant, were his counsel.
These two doctors, whom, to avoid any malicious applications, we shall distinguish by the names of Dr Y. and Dr Z., having felt his pulse; to wit, Dr Y. his right arm, and Dr Z. his left; both agreed that he was absolutely dead; but as to the distemper, or cause of his death, they
84
differed; Dr Y. holding that he died of an apoplexy, and Dr Z. of an epilepsy.
Hence arose a dispute between the learned men, in which each delivered the reasons of their several opinions. These were of such equal force, that they served both to confirm either doctor in his own sentiments, and made not the least impression on his adversary.
To say the truth, every physician almost hath his favourite disease, to which he ascribes all the victories obtained over human nature. The gout, the rheumatism, the stone, the gravel, and the consumption, have all their several patrons in the faculty; and none more than the nervous fever, or the fever on the spirits. And here we may account for those disagreements in opinion, concerning the cause of a patient's death, which sometimes occur, between the most learned of the college; and which have greatly surprized that part of the world who have been ignorant of the fact we have above asserted.
The reader may perhaps be surprized, that, instead of endeavouring to revive the patient, the learned gentlemen should fall immediately into a dispute on the occasion of his death; but in reality all such experiments had been made before their arrival: for the captain was put into a warm bed, had his veins scarified, his forehead chafed, and all sorts of strong drops applied to his lips and nostrils.
The physicians, therefore, finding themselves anticipated in everything they ordered, were at a loss how to apply that portion of time which it is usual and decent to remain for their fee, and were therefore necessitated to find some subject or other for discourse; and what could more naturally present itself than that before mentioned?
Our doctors were about to take their leave, when Mr Allworthy, having given over the captain, and acquiesced in the Divine will, began to enquire after his sister, whom he desired them to visit before their departure.
This lady was now recovered of her fit, and, to use the common phrase, as well as could be expected for one in her condition. The doctors, therefore, all previous ceremonies being complied with, as this was a new patient, attended, according to desire, and laid hold on each of her hands, as they had before done on those of the corpse.
The case of the lady was in the other extreme from that of her husband: for as he was past all the assistance of physic, so in reality she required none.
85
There is nothing more unjust than the vulgar opinion, by which physicians are misrepresented, as friends to death. On the contrary, I believe, if the number of those who recover by physic could be opposed to that of the martyrs to it, the former would rather exceed the latter. Nay, some are so cautious on this head, that, to avoid a possibility of killing the patient, they abstain from all methods of curing, and prescribe nothing but what can neither do good nor harm. I have heard some of these, with great gravity, deliver it as a maxim, "That Nature should be left to do her own work, while the physician stands by as it were to clap her on the back, and encourage her when she doth well."
So little then did our doctors delight in death, that they discharged the corpse after a single fee; but they were not so disgusted with their living patient; concerning whose case they immediately agreed, and fell to prescribing with great diligence.
Whether, as the lady had at first persuaded her physicians to believe her ill, they had now, in return, persuaded her to believe herself so, I will not determine; but she continued a whole month with all the decorations of sickness. During this time she was visited by physicians, attended by nurses, and received constant messages from her acquaintance to enquire after her health.
At length the decent time for sickness and immoderate grief being expired, the doctors were discharged, and the lady began to see company; being altered only from what she was before, by that colour of sadness in which she had dressed her person and countenance.
The captain was now interred, and might, perhaps, have already made a large progress towards oblivion, had not the friendship of Mr Allworthy taken care to preserve his memory, by the following epitaph, which was written by a man of as great genius as integrity, and one who perfectly well knew the captain.

Chapter 且
Containing little or nothing.
The reader will be pleased to remember, that, at the beginning of the second book of this history, we gave him a hint of our intention to pass over several large periods of time, in which nothing happened worthy of being recorded in a chronicle of this kind.
In so doing, we do not only consult our own dignity and ease, but the good and advantage of the reader: for besides that by these means we prevent him from throwing away his time, in reading without either pleasure or emolument, we give him, at all such seasons, an opportunity of employing that wonderful sagacity, of which he is master, by filling up these vacant spaces of time with his own conjectures; for which purpose we have taken care to qualify him in the preceding pages.
For instance, what reader but knows that Mr Allworthy felt, at first, for the loss of his friend, those emotions of grief, which on such occasions enter into all men whose hearts are not composed of flint, or their heads of as solid materials? Again, what reader doth not know that philosophy and religion in time moderated, and at last extinguished, this grief? The former of these teaching the folly and vanity of it, and the latter correcting it as unlawful, and at the same time assuaging it, by raising future hopes and assurances, which enable a strong and religious mind to take leave of a friend, on his deathbed, with little less indifference than if he was preparing for a long journey; and, indeed, with little less hope of seeing him again.
Nor can the judicious reader be at a greater loss on account of Mrs Bridget Blifil, who, he may be assured, conducted herself through the whole season in which grief is to make its appearance on the outside of the body, with the strictest regard to all the rules of custom and decency, suiting the alterations of her countenance to the several alterations of her habit: for as this changed from weeds to black, from black to grey, from grey to white, so did her countenance change from dismal to sorrowful,
89
from sorrowful to sad, and from sad to serious, till the day came in which she was allowed to return to her former serenity.
We have mentioned these two, as examples only of the task which may be imposed on readers of the lowest class. Much higher and harder exercises of judgment and penetration may reasonably be expected from the upper graduates in criticism. Many notable discoveries will, I doubt not, be made by such, of the transactions which happened in the family of our worthy man, during all the years which we have thought proper to pass over: for though nothing worthy of a place in this history occurred within that period, yet did several incidents happen of equal importance with those reported by the daily and weekly historians of the age; in reading which great numbers of persons consume a considerable part of their time, very little, I am afraid, to their emolument. Now, in the conjectures here proposed, some of the most excellent faculties of the mind may be employed to much advantage, since it is a more useful capacity to be able to foretel the actions of men, in any circumstance, from their characters, than to judge of their characters from their actions. The former, I own, requires the greater penetration; but may be accomplished by true sagacity with no less certainty than the latter.
As we are sensible that much the greatest part of our readers are very eminently possessed of this quality, we have left them a space of twelve years to exert it in; and shall now bring forth our heroe, at about fourteen years of age, not questioning that many have been long impatient to be introduced to his acquaintance.

Chapter
The heroe of this great history appears with very bad omens. A little tale of so LOW a kind that some may think it not worth their notice. A word or two concerning a squire, and more relating to a gamekeeper and a schoolmaster.
As we determined, when we first sat down to write this history, to flatter no man, but to guide our pen throughout by the directions of truth, we are obliged to bring our heroe on the stage in a much more disadvantageous manner than we could wish; and to declare honestly, even at his first appearance, that it was the universal opinion of all Mr Allworthy's family that he was certainly born to be hanged.
Indeed, I am sorry to say there was too much reason for this conjecture; the lad having from his earliest years discovered a propensity to many vices, and especially to one which hath as direct a tendency as any other to that fate which we have just now observed to have been prophetically denounced against him: he had been already convicted of three robberies, viz., of robbing an orchard, of stealing a duck out of a farmer's yard, and of picking Master Blifil's pocket of a ball.
The vices of this young man were, moreover, heightened by the disadvantageous light in which they appeared when opposed to the virtues of Master Blifil, his companion; a youth of so different a cast from little Jones, that not only the family but all the neighbourhood resounded his praises. He was, indeed, a lad of a remarkable disposition; sober, discreet, and pious beyond his age; qualities which gained him the love of every one who knew him: while Tom Jones was universally disliked; and many expressed their wonder that Mr Allworthy would suffer such a lad to be educated with his nephew, lest the morals of the latter should be corrupted by his example.
An incident which happened about this time will set the characters of these two lads more fairly before the discerning reader than is in the power of the longest dissertation.
91
Tom Jones, who, bad as he is, must serve for the heroe of this history, had only one friend among all the servants of the family; for as to Mrs Wilkins, she had long since given him up, and was perfectly reconciled to her mistress. This friend was the gamekeeper, a fellow of a loose kind of disposition, and who was thought not to entertain much stricter notions concerning the difference of meum and tuum than the young gentleman himself. And hence this friendship gave occasion to many sarcastical remarks among the domestics, most of which were either proverbs before, or at least are become so now; and, indeed, the wit of them all may be comprised in that short Latin proverb, "Noscitur a socio;" which, I think, is thus expressed in English, "You may know him by the company he keeps."
To say the truth, some of that atrocious wickedness in Jones, of which we have just mentioned three examples, might perhaps be derived from the encouragement he had received from this fellow, who, in two or three instances, had been what the law calls an accessary after the fact: for the whole duck, and great part of the apples, were converted to the use of the gamekeeper and his family; though, as Jones alone was discovered, the poor lad bore not only the whole smart, but the whole blame; both which fell again to his lot on the following occasion.
Contiguous to Mr Allworthy's estate was the manor of one of those gentlemen who are called preservers of the game. This species of men, from the great severity with which they revenge the death of a hare or partridge, might be thought to cultivate the same superstition with the Bannians in India; many of whom, we are told, dedicate their whole lives to the preservation and protection of certain animals; was it not that our English Bannians, while they preserve them from other enemies, will most unmercifully slaughter whole horse-loads themselves; so that they stand clearly acquitted of any such heathenish superstition.
I have, indeed, a much better opinion of this kind of men than is entertained by some, as I take them to answer the order of Nature, and the good purposes for which they were ordained, in a more ample manner than many others. Now, as Horace tells us that there are a set of human beings
Fruges consumere nati,
"Born to consume the fruits of the earth;" so I make no manner of doubt but that there are others
Feras consumere nati,
92
"Born to consume the beasts of the field;" or, as it is commonly called, the game; and none, I believe, will deny but that those squires fulfil this end of their creation.
Little Jones went one day a shooting with the gamekeeper; when happening to spring a covey of partridges near the border of that manor over which Fortune, to fulfil the wise purposes of Nature, had planted one of the game consumers, the birds flew into it, and were marked (as it is called) by the two sportsmen, in some furze bushes, about two or three hundred paces beyond Mr Allworthy's dominions.
Mr Allworthy had given the fellow strict orders, on pain of forfeiting his place, never to trespass on any of his neighbours; no more on those who were less rigid in this matter than on the lord of this manor. With regard to others, indeed, these orders had not been always very scrupulously kept; but as the disposition of the gentleman with whom the partridges had taken sanctuary was well known, the gamekeeper had never yet attempted to invade his territories. Nor had he done it now, had not the younger sportsman, who was excessively eager to pursue the flying game, over-persuaded him; but Jones being very importunate, the other, who was himself keen enough after the sport, yielded to his persuasions, entered the manor, and shot one of the partridges.
The gentleman himself was at that time on horse-back, at a little distance from them; and hearing the gun go off, he immediately made towards the place, and discovered poor Tom; for the gamekeeper had leapt into the thickest part of the furze-brake, where he had happily concealed himself.
The gentleman having searched the lad, and found the partridge upon him, denounced great vengeance, swearing he would acquaint Mr Allworthy. He was as good as his word: for he rode immediately to his house, and complained of the trespass on his manor in as high terms and as bitter language as if his house had been broken open, and the most valuable furniture stole out of it. He added, that some other person was in his company, though he could not discover him; for that two guns had been discharged almost in the same instant. And, says he, "We have found only this partridge, but the Lord knows what mischief they have done."
At his return home, Tom was presently convened before Mr Allworthy. He owned the fact, and alledged no other excuse but what was really true, viz., that the covey was originally sprung in Mr Allworthy's own manor.
93
Tom was then interrogated who was with him, which Mr Allworthy declared he was resolved to know, acquainting the culprit with the circumstance of the two guns, which had been deposed by the squire and both his servants; but Tom stoutly persisted in asserting that he was alone; yet, to say the truth, he hesitated a little at first, which would have confirmed Mr Allworthy's belief, had what the squire and his servants said wanted any further confirmation.
The gamekeeper, being a suspected person, was now sent for, and the question put to him; but he, relying on the promise which Tom had made him, to take all upon himself, very resolutely denied being in company with the young gentleman, or indeed having seen him the whole afternoon.
Mr Allworthy then turned towards Tom, with more than usual anger in his countenance, and advised him to confess who was with him; repeating, that he was resolved to know. The lad, however, still maintained his resolution, and was dismissed with much wrath by Mr Allworthy, who told him he should have to the next morning to consider of it, when he should be questioned by another person, and in another manner.
Poor Jones spent a very melancholy night; and the more so, as he was without his usual companion; for Master Blifil was gone abroad on a visit with his mother. Fear of the punishment he was to suffer was on this occasion his least evil; his chief anxiety being, lest his constancy should fail him, and he should be brought to betray the gamekeeper, whose ruin he knew must now be the consequence.
Nor did the gamekeeper pass his time much better. He had the same apprehensions with the youth; for whose honour he had likewise a much tenderer regard than for his skin.
In the morning, when Tom attended the reverend Mr Thwackum, the person to whom Mr Allworthy had committed the instruction of the two boys, he had the same questions put to him by that gentleman which he had been asked the evening before, to which he returned the same answers. The consequence of this was, so severe a whipping, that it possibly fell little short of the torture with which confessions are in some countries extorted from criminals.
Tom bore his punishment with great resolution; and though his master asked him, between every stroke, whether he would not confess, he was contented to be flead rather than betray his friend, or break the promise he had made.
94
The gamekeeper was now relieved from his anxiety, and Mr Allworthy himself began to be concerned at Tom's sufferings: for besides that Mr Thwackum, being highly enraged that he was not able to make the boy say what he himself pleased, had carried his severity much beyond the good man's intention, this latter began now to suspect that the squire had been mistaken; which his extreme eagerness and anger seemed to make probable; and as for what the servants had said in confirmation of their master's account, he laid no great stress upon that. Now, as cruelty and injustice were two ideas of which Mr Allworthy could by no means support the consciousness a single moment, he sent for Tom, and after many kind and friendly exhortations, said, "I am convinced, my dear child, that my suspicions have wronged you; I am sorry that you have been so severely punished on this account." And at last gave him a little horse to make him amends; again repeating his sorrow for what had past.
Tom's guilt now flew in his face more than any severity could make it. He could more easily bear the lashes of Thwackum, than the generosity of Allworthy. The tears burst from his eyes, and he fell upon his knees, crying, "Oh, sir, you are too good to me. Indeed you are. Indeed I don't deserve it." And at that very instant, from the fulness of his heart, had almost betrayed the secret; but the good genius of the gamekeeper suggested to him what might be the consequence to the poor fellow, and this consideration sealed his lips.
Thwackum did all he could to persuade Allworthy from showing any compassion or kindness to the boy, saying, "He had persisted in an untruth;" and gave some hints, that a second whipping might probably bring the matter to light.
But Mr Allworthy absolutely refused to consent to the experiment. He said, the boy had suffered enough already for concealing the truth, even if he was guilty, seeing that he could have no motive but a mistaken point of honour for so doing.
"Honour!" cryed Thwackum, with some warmth, "mere stubbornness and obstinacy! Can honour teach any one to tell a lie, or can any honour exist independent of religion?"
This discourse happened at table when dinner was just ended; and there were present Mr Allworthy, Mr Thwackum, and a third gentleman, who now entered into the debate, and whom, before we proceed any further, we shall briefly introduce to our reader's acquaintance.

Chapter U
The character of Mr Square the philosopher, and of Mr Thwackum the divine; with a dispute concerning------
The name of this gentleman, who had then resided some time at Mr Allworthy's house, was Mr Square. His natural parts were not of the first rate, but he had greatly improved them by a learned education. He was deeply read in the antients, and a profest master of all the works of Plato and Aristotle. Upon which great models he had principally formed himself; sometimes according with the opinion of the one, and sometimes with that of the other. In morals he was a profest Platonist, and in religion he inclined to be an Aristotelian.
But though he had, as we have said, formed his morals on the Platonic model, yet he perfectly agreed with the opinion of Aristotle, in considering that great man rather in the quality of a philosopher or a speculatist, than as a legislator. This sentiment he carried a great way; indeed, so far, as to regard all virtue as matter of theory only. This, it is true, he never affirmed, as I have heard, to any one; and yet upon the least attention to his conduct, I cannot help thinking it was his real opinion, as it will perfectly reconcile some contradictions which might otherwise appear in his character.
This gentleman and Mr Thwackum scarce ever met without a disputation; for their tenets were indeed diametrically opposite to each other. Square held human nature to be the perfection of all virtue, and that vice was a deviation from our nature, in the same manner as deformity of body is. Thwackum, on the contrary, maintained that the human mind, since the fall, was nothing but a sink of iniquity, till purified and redeemed by grace. In one point only they agreed, which was, in all their discourses on morality never to mention the word goodness. The favourite phrase of the former, was the natural beauty of virtue; that of the latter, was the divine power of grace. The former measured all actions by the unalterable rule of right, and the eternal fitness of things; the latter decided all matters by authority; but in doing this, he always used the
96
scriptures and their commentators, as the lawyer doth his Coke upon Lyttleton, where the comment is of equal authority with the text.
After this short introduction, the reader will be pleased to remember, that the parson had concluded his speech with a triumphant question, to which he had apprehended no answer; viz., Can any honour exist independent on religion?
To this Square answered; that it was impossible to discourse philosophically concerning words, till their meaning was first established: that there were scarce any two words of a more vague and uncertain signification, than the two he had mentioned; for that there were almost as many different opinions concerning honour, as concerning religion. "But," says he, "if by honour you mean the true natural beauty of virtue, I will maintain it may exist independent of any religion whatever. Nay," added he, "you yourself will allow it may exist independent of all but one: so will a Mahometan, a Jew, and all the maintainers of all the different sects in the world."
Thwackum replied, this was arguing with the usual malice of all the enemies to the true Church. He said, he doubted not but that all the infidels and hereticks in the world would, if they could, confine honour to their own absurd errors and damnable deceptions; "but honour," says he, "is not therefore manifold, because there are many absurd opinions about it; nor is religion manifold, because there are various sects and heresies in the world. When I mention religion, I mean the Christian religion; and not only the Christian religion, but the Protestant religion; and not only the Protestant religion, but the Church of England. And when I mention honour, I mean that mode of Divine grace which is not only consistent with, but dependent upon, this religion; and is consistent with and dependent upon no other. Now to say that the honour I here mean, and which was, I thought, all the honour I could be supposed to mean, will uphold, much less dictate an untruth, is to assert an absurdity too shocking to be conceived."
"I purposely avoided," says Square, "drawing a conclusion which I thought evident from what I have said; but if you perceived it, I am sure you have not attempted to answer it. However, to drop the article of religion, I think it is plain, from what you have said, that we have different ideas of honour; or why do we not agree in the same terms of its explanation? I have asserted, that true honour and true virtue are almost synonymous terms, and they are both founded on the unalterable rule of right, and the eternal fitness of things; to which an untruth being
97
absolutely repugnant and contrary, it is certain that true honour cannot support an untruth. In this, therefore, I think we are agreed; but that this honour can be said to be founded on religion, to which it is antecedent, if by religion be meant any positive law一"
"I agree," answered Thwackum, with great warmth, "with a man who asserts honour to be antecedent to religion! Mr Allworthy, did I agree一?
He was proceeding when Mr Allworthy interposed, telling them very coldly, they had both mistaken his meaning; for that he had said nothing of true honour.一It is possible, however, he would not have easily quieted the disputants, who were growing equally warm, had not another matter now fallen out, which put a final end to the conversation at present.
98
Containing a necessary apology for the author; and a childish incident, which perhaps requires an apology likewise.
Before I proceed farther, I shall beg leave to obviate some misconstructions into which the zeal of some few readers may lead them; for I would not willingly give offence to any, especially to men who are warm in the cause of virtue or religion.
I hope, therefore, no man will, by the grossest misunderstanding or perversion of my meaning, misrepresent me, as endeavouring to cast any ridicule on the greatest perfections of human nature; and which do, indeed, alone purify and ennoble the heart of man, and raise him above the brute creation. This, reader, I will venture to say (and by how much the better man you are yourself, by so much the more will you be inclined to believe me), that I would rather have buried the sentiments of these two persons in eternal oblivion, than have done any injury to either of these glorious causes.
On the contrary, it is with a view to their service, that I have taken upon me to record the lives and actions of two of their false and pretended champions. A treacherous friend is the most dangerous enemy; and I will say boldly, that both religion and virtue have received more real discredit from hypocrites than the wittiest profligates or infidels could ever cast upon them: nay, farther, as these two, in their purity, are rightly called the bands of civil society, and are indeed the greatest of blessings; so when poisoned and corrupted with fraud, pretence, and affectation, they have become the worst of civil curses, and have enabled men to perpetrate the most cruel mischiefs to their own species.
Indeed, I doubt not but this ridicule will in general be allowed: my chief apprehension is, as many true and just sentiments often came from the mouths of these persons, lest the whole should be taken together, and I should be conceived to ridicule all alike. Now the reader will be pleased to consider, that, as neither of these men were fools, they could
99
not be supposed to have holden none but wrong principles, and to have uttered nothing but absurdities; what injustice, therefore, must I have done to their characters, had I selected only what was bad! And how horribly wretched and maimed must their arguments have appeared!
Upon the whole, it is not religion or virtue, but the want of them, which is here exposed. Had not Thwackum too much neglected virtue, and Square, religion, in the composition of their several systems, and had not both utterly discarded all natural goodness of heart, they had never been represented as the objects of derision in this history; in which we will now proceed.
This matter then, which put an end to the debate mentioned in the last chapter, was no other than a quarrel between Master Blifil and Tom Jones, the consequence of which had been a bloody nose to the former; for though Master Blifil, notwithstanding he was the younger, was in size above the other's match, yet Tom was much his superior at the noble art of boxing.
Tom, however, cautiously avoided all engagements with that youth; for besides that Tommy Jones was an inoffensive lad amidst all his roguery, and really loved Blifil, Mr Thwackum being always the second of the latter, would have been sufficient to deter him.
But well says a certain author, No man is wise at all hours; it is therefore no wonder that a boy is not so. A difference arising at play between the two lads, Master Blifil called Tom a beggarly bastard. Upon which the latter, who was somewhat passionate in his disposition, immediately caused that phenomenon in the face of the former, which we have above remembered.
Master Blifil now, with his blood running from his nose, and the tears galloping after from his eyes, appeared before his uncle and the tremendous Thwackum. In which court an indictment of assault, battery, and wounding, was instantly preferred against Tom; who in his excuse only pleaded the provocation, which was indeed all the matter that Master Blifil had omitted.
It is indeed possible that this circumstance might have escaped his memory; for, in his reply, he positively insisted, that he had made use of no such appellation; adding, "Heaven forbid such naughty words should ever come out of his mouth!"
Tom, though against all form of law, rejoined in affirmance of the words. Upon which Master Blifil said, "It is no wonder. Those who will
100
tell one fib, will hardly stick at another. If I had told my master such a wicked fib as you have done, I should be ashamed to show my face."
"What fib, child?" cries Thwackum pretty eagerly.
"Why, he told you that nobody was with him a shooting when he killed the partridge; but he knows" (here he burst into a flood of tears), "yes, he knows, for he confessed it to me, that Black George the gamekeeper was there. Nay, he said一yes you did一deny it if you can, that you would not have confest the truth, though master had cut you to pieces."
At this the fire flashed from Thwackum's eyes, and he cried out in triumph一"Oh! ho! this is your mistaken notion of honour! This is the boy who was not to be whipped again!" But Mr Allworthy, with a more gentle aspect, turned towards the lad, and said, "Is this true, child? How came you to persist so obstinately in a falsehood?"
Tom said, "He scorned a lie as much as any one: but he thought his honour engaged him to act as he did; for he had promised the poor fellow to conceal him: which," he said, "he thought himself farther obliged to, as the gamekeeper had begged him not to go into the gentleman's manor, and had at last gone himself, in compliance with his persuasions." He said, "This was the whole truth of the matter, and he would take his oath of it;" and concluded with very passionately begging Mr Allworthy "to have compassion on the poor fellow's family, especially as he himself only had been guilty, and the other had been very difficultly prevailed on to do what he did. Indeed, sir," said he, "it could hardly be called a lie that I told; for the poor fellow was entirely innocent of the whole matter. I should have gone alone after the birds; nay, I did go at first, and he only followed me to prevent more mischief. Do, pray, sir, let me be punished; take my little horse away again; but pray, sir, forgive poor George."
Mr Allworthy hesitated a few moments, and then dismissed the boys, advising them to live more friendly and peaceably together.

Chapter U
The opinions of the divine and the philosopher concerning the two boys; with some reasons for their opinions, and other matters.
It is probable, that by disclosing this secret, which had been communicated in the utmost confidence to him, young Blifil preserved his companion from a good lashing; for the offence of the bloody nose would have been of itself sufficient cause for Thwackum to have proceeded to correction; but now this was totally absorbed in the consideration of the other matter; and with regard to this, Mr Allworthy declared privately, he thought the boy deserved reward rather than punishment, so that Thwackum's hand was withheld by a general pardon.
Thwackum, whose meditations were full of birch, exclaimed against this weak, and, as he said he would venture to call it, wicked lenity. To remit the punishment of such crimes was, he said, to encourage them. He enlarged much on the correction of children, and quoted many texts from Solomon, and others; which being to be found in so many other books, shall not be found here. He then applied himself to the vice of lying, on which head he was altogether as learned as he had been on the other.
Square said, he had been endeavouring to reconcile the behaviour of Tom with his idea of perfect virtue, but could not. He owned there was something which at first sight appeared like fortitude in the action; but as fortitude was a virtue, and falsehood a vice, they could by no means agree or unite together. He added, that as this was in some measure to confound virtue and vice, it might be worth Mr Thwackum's consideration, whether a larger castigation might not be laid on upon the account.
As both these learned men concurred in censuring Jones, so were they no less unanimous in applauding Master Blifil. To bring truth to light, was by the parson asserted to be the duty of every religious man; and by the philosopher this was declared to be highly conformable with the rule of right, and the eternal and unalterable fitness of things.
102
All this, however, weighed very little with Mr Allworthy. He could not be prevailed on to sign the warrant for the execution of Jones. There was something within his own breast with which the invincible fidelity which that youth had preserved, corresponded much better than it had done with the religion of Thwackum, or with the virtue of Square. He therefore strictly ordered the former of these gentlemen to abstain from laying violent hands on Tom for what had past. The pedagogue was obliged to obey those orders; but not without great reluctance, and frequent mutterings that the boy would be certainly spoiled.
Towards the gamekeeper the good man behaved with more severity. He presently summoned that poor fellow before him, and after many bitter remonstrances, paid him his wages, and dismist him from his service; for Mr Allworthy rightly observed, that there was a great difference between being guilty of a falsehood to excuse yourself, and to excuse another. He likewise urged, as the principal motive to his inflexible severity against this man, that he had basely suffered Tom Jones to undergo so heavy a punishment for his sake, whereas he ought to have prevented it by making the discovery himself.
When this story became public, many people differed from Square and Thwackum, in judging the conduct of the two lads on the occasion. Master Blifil was generally called a sneaking rascal, a poor-spirited wretch, with other epithets of the like kind; whilst Tom was honoured with the appellations of a brave lad, a jolly dog, and an honest fellow. Indeed, his behaviour to Black George much ingratiated him with all the servants; for though that fellow was before universally disliked, yet he was no sooner turned away than he was as universally pitied; and the friendship and gallantry of Tom Jones was celebrated by them all with the highest applause; and they condemned Master Blifil as openly as they durst, without incurring the danger of offending his mother. For all this, however, poor Tom smarted in the flesh; for though Thwackum had been inhibited to exercise his arm on the foregoing account, yet, as the proverb says, It is easy to find a stick, &amp;c. So was it easy to find a rod; and, indeed, the not being able to find one was the only thing which could have kept Thwackum any long time from chastising poor Jones.
Had the bare delight in the sport been the only inducement to the pedagogue, it is probable Master Blifil would likewise have had his share; but though Mr Allworthy had given him frequent orders to make no difference between the lads, yet was Thwackum altogether as kind and gentle to this youth, as he was harsh, nay even barbarous, to the other. To say the truth, Blifil had greatly gained his master's affections; partly
103
by the profound respect he always showed his person, but much more by the decent reverence with which he received his doctrine; for he had got by heart, and frequently repeated, his phrases, and maintained all his master's religious principles with a zeal which was surprizing in one so young, and which greatly endeared him to the worthy preceptor.
Tom Jones, on the other hand, was not only deficient in outward tokens of respect, often forgetting to pull off his hat, or to bow at his master's approach; but was altogether as unmindful both of his master's precepts and example. He was indeed a thoughtless, giddy youth, with little sobriety in his manners, and less in his countenance; and would often very impudently and indecently laugh at his companion for his serious behaviour.
Mr Square had the same reason for his preference of the former lad; for Tom Jones showed no more regard to the learned discourses which this gentleman would sometimes throw away upon him, than to those of Thwackum. He once ventured to make a jest of the rule of right; and at another time said, he believed there was no rule in the world capable of making such a man as his father (for so Mr Allworthy suffered himself to be called).
Master Blifil, on the contrary, had address enough at sixteen to recommend himself at one and the same time to both these opposites. With one he was all religion, with the other he was all virtue. And when both were present, he was profoundly silent, which both interpreted in his favour and in their own.
Nor was Blifil contented with flattering both these gentlemen to their faces; he took frequent occasions of praising them behind their backs to Allworthy; before whom, when they two were alone, and his uncle commended any religious or virtuous sentiment (for many such came constantly from him) he seldom failed to ascribe it to the good instructions he had received from either Thwackum or Square; for he knew his uncle repeated all such compliments to the persons for whose use they were meant; and he found by experience the great impressions which they made on the philosopher, as well as on the divine: for, to say the truth, there is no kind of flattery so irresistible as this, at second hand.
The young gentleman, moreover, soon perceived how extremely grateful all those panegyrics on his instructors were to Mr Allworthy himself, as they so loudly resounded the praise of that singular plan of education which he had laid down; for this worthy man having observed the imperfect institution of our public schools, and the many vices which boys
104
were there liable to learn, had resolved to educate his nephew, as well as the other lad, whom he had in a manner adopted, in his own house; where he thought their morals would escape all that danger of being corrupted to which they would be unavoidably exposed in any public school or university.
Having, therefore, determined to commit these boys to the tuition of a private tutor, Mr Thwackum was recommended to him for that office, by a very particular friend, of whose understanding Mr Allworthy had a great opinion, and in whose integrity he placed much confidence. This Thwackum was fellow of a college, where he almost entirely resided; and had a great reputation for learning, religion, and sobriety of manners. And these were doubtless the qualifications by which Mr Allworthy's friend had been induced to recommend him; though indeed this friend had some obligations to Thwackum's family, who were the most considerable persons in a borough which that gentleman represented in parliament.
Thwackum, at his first arrival, was extremely agreeable to Allworthy; and indeed he perfectly answered the character which had been given of him. Upon longer acquaintance, however, and more intimate conversation, this worthy man saw infirmities in the tutor, which he could have wished him to have been without; though as those seemed greatly overbalanced by his good qualities, they did not incline Mr Allworthy to part with him: nor would they indeed have justified such a proceeding; for the reader is greatly mistaken, if he conceives that Thwackum appeared to Mr Allworthy in the same light as he doth to him in this history; and he is as much deceived, if he imagines that the most intimate acquaintance which he himself could have had with that divine, would have informed him of those things which we, from our inspiration, are enabled to open and discover. Of readers who, from such conceits as these, condemn the wisdom or penetration of Mr Allworthy, I shall not scruple to say, that they make a very bad and ungrateful use of that knowledge which we have communicated to them.
These apparent errors in the doctrine of Thwackum served greatly to palliate the contrary errors in that of Square, which our good man no less saw and condemned. He thought, indeed, that the different exuberancies of these gentlemen would correct their different imperfections; and that from both, especially with his assistance, the two lads would derive sufficient precepts of true religion and virtue. If the event happened contrary to his expectations, this possibly proceeded from some fault in the plan itself; which the reader hath my leave to discover, if he can: for we
105
do not pretend to introduce any infallible characters into this history; where we hope nothing will be found which hath never yet been seen in human nature.
To return therefore: the reader will not, I think, wonder that the different behaviour of the two lads above commemorated, produced the different effects of which he hath already seen some instance; and besides this, there was another reason for the conduct of the philosopher and the pedagogue; but this being matter of great importance, we shall reveal it in the next chapter.
106
CT6
Containing a better reason still for the before-mentioned opinions.
It is to be known then, that those two learned personages, who have lately made a considerable figure on the theatre of this history, had, from their first arrival at Mr Allworthy's house, taken so great an affection, the one to his virtue, the other to his religion, that they had meditated the closest alliance with him.
For this purpose they had cast their eyes on that fair widow, whom, though we have not for some time made any mention of her, the reader, we trust, hath not forgot. Mrs Blifil was indeed the object to which they both aspired.
It may seem remarkable, that, of four persons whom we have commemorated at Mr Allworthy's house, three of them should fix their inclinations on a lady who was never greatly celebrated for her beauty, and who was, moreover, now a little descended into the vale of years; but in reality bosom friends, and intimate acquaintance, have a kind of natural propensity to particular females at the house of a friend一viz., to his grandmother, mother, sister, daughter, aunt, niece, or cousin, when they are rich; and to his wife, sister, daughter, niece, cousin, mistress, or servant-maid, if they should be handsome.
We would not, however, have our reader imagine, that persons of such characters as were supported by Thwackum and Square, would undertake a matter of this kind, which hath been a little censured by some rigid moralists, before they had thoroughly examined it, and considered whether it was (as Shakespear phrases it) "Stuff o' th' conscience," or no. Thwackum was encouraged to the undertaking by reflecting that to covet your neighbour's sister is nowhere forbidden: and he knew it was a rule in the construction of all laws, that "Expressum facit cessare tacitum.'' The sense of which is, "When a lawgiver sets down plainly his whole meaning, we are prevented from making him mean what we please ourselves." As some instances of women, therefore, are mentioned in the
107
divine law, which forbids us to covet our neighbour's goods, and that of a sister omitted, he concluded it to be lawful. And as to Square, who was in his person what is called a jolly fellow, or a widow's man, he easily reconciled his choice to the eternal fitness of things.
Now, as both of these gentlemen were industrious in taking every opportunity of recommending themselves to the widow, they apprehended one certain method was, by giving her son the constant preference to the other lad; and as they conceived the kindness and affection which Mr Allworthy showed the latter, must be highly disagreeable to her, they doubted not but the laying hold on all occasions to degrade and vilify him, would be highly pleasing to her; who, as she hated the boy, must love all those who did him any hurt. In this Thwackum had the advantage; for while Square could only scarify the poor lad's reputation, he could flea his skin; and, indeed, he considered every lash he gave him as a compliment paid to his mistress; so that he could, with the utmost propriety, repeat this old flogging line, "Castigo te non quod odio habeam, sed quod AMEM. I chastise thee not out of hatred, but out of love." And this, indeed, he often had in his mouth, or rather, according to the old phrase, never more properly applied, at his fingers' ends.
For this reason, principally, the two gentlemen concurred, as we have seen above, in their opinion concerning the two lads; this being, indeed, almost the only instance of their concurring on any point; for, beside the difference of their principles, they had both long ago strongly suspected each other's design, and hated one another with no little degree of inveteracy.
This mutual animosity was a good deal increased by their alternate successes; for Mrs Blifil knew what they would be at long before they imagined it; or, indeed, intended she should: for they proceeded with great caution, lest she should be offended, and acquaint Mr Allworthy. But they had no reason for any such fear; she was well enough pleased with a passion, of which she intended none should have any fruits but herself. And the only fruits she designed for herself were, flattery and courtship; for which purpose she soothed them by turns, and a long time equally. She was, indeed, rather inclined to favour the parson's principles; but Square's person was more agreeable to her eye, for he was a comely man; whereas the pedagogue did in countenance very nearly resemble that gentleman, who, in the Harlot's Progress, is seen correcting the ladies in Bridewell.
108
Whether Mrs Blifil had been surfeited with the sweets of marriage, or disgusted by its bitters, or from what other cause it proceeded, I will not determine; but she could never be brought to listen to any second proposals. However, she at last conversed with Square with such a degree of intimacy that malicious tongues began to whisper things of her, to which, as well for the sake of the lady, as that they were highly disagreeable to the rule of right and the fitness of things, we will give no credit, and therefore shall not blot our paper with them. The pedagogue, 'tis certain, whipped on, without getting a step nearer to his journey's end.
Indeed he had committed a great error, and that Square discovered much sooner than himself. Mrs Blifil (as, perhaps, the reader may have formerly guessed) was not over and above pleased with the behaviour of her husband; nay, to be honest, she absolutely hated him, till his death at last a little reconciled him to her affections. It will not be therefore greatly wondered at, if she had not the most violent regard to the offspring she had by him. And, in fact, she had so little of this regard, that in his infancy she seldom saw her son, or took any notice of him; and hence she acquiesced, after a little reluctance, in all the favours which Mr Allworthy showered on the foundling; whom the good man called his own boy, and in all things put on an entire equality with Master Blifil. This acquiescence in Mrs Blifil was considered by the neighbours, and by the family, as a mark of her condescension to her brother's humour, and she was imagined by all others, as well as Thwackum and Square, to hate the foundling in her heart; nay, the more civility she showed him, the more they conceived she detested him, and the surer schemes she was laying for his ruin: for as they thought it her interest to hate him, it was very difficult for her to persuade them she did not.
Thwackum was the more confirmed in his opinion, as she had more than once slily caused him to whip Tom Jones, when Mr Allworthy, who was an enemy to this exercise, was abroad; whereas she had never given any such orders concerning young Blifil. And this had likewise imposed upon Square. In reality, though she certainly hated her own son一of which, however monstrous it appears, I am assured she is not a singular instance一she appeared, notwithstanding all her outward compliance, to be in her heart sufficiently displeased with all the favour shown by Mr Allworthy to the foundling. She frequently complained of this behind her brother's back, and very sharply censured him for it, both to Thwack-um and Square; nay, she would throw it in the teeth of Allworthy himself, when a little quarrel, or miff, as it is vulgarly called, arose between them.
109
However, when Tom grew up, and gave tokens of that gallantry of temper which greatly recommends men to women, this disinclination which she had discovered to him when a child, by degrees abated, and at last she so evidently demonstrated her affection to him to be much stronger than what she bore her own son, that it was impossible to mistake her any longer. She was so desirous of often seeing him, and discovered such satisfaction and delight in his company, that before he was eighteen years old he was become a rival to both Square and Thwackum; and what is worse, the whole country began to talk as loudly of her inclination to Tom, as they had before done of that which she had shown to Square: on which account the philosopher conceived the most implacable hatred for our poor heroe.

Chapter /
In which the author himself makes his appearance on the stage.
Though Mr Allworthy was not of himself hasty to see things in a disadvantageous light, and was a stranger to the public voice, which seldom reaches to a brother or a husband, though it rings in the ears of all the neighbourhood; yet was this affection of Mrs Blifil to Tom, and the preference which she too visibly gave him to her own son, of the utmost disadvantage to that youth.
For such was the compassion which inhabited Mr Allworthy's mind, that nothing but the steel of justice could ever subdue it. To be unfortunate in any respect was sufficient, if there was no demerit to counterpoise it, to turn the scale of that good man's pity, and to engage his friendship and his benefaction.
When therefore he plainly saw Master Blifil was absolutely detested (for that he was) by his own mother, he began, on that account only, to look with an eye of compassion upon him; and what the effects of compassion are, in good and benevolent minds, I need not here explain to most of my readers.
Henceforward he saw every appearance of virtue in the youth through the magnifying end, and viewed all his faults with the glass inverted, so that they became scarce perceptible. And this perhaps the amiable temper of pity may make commendable; but the next step the weakness of human nature alone must excuse; for he no sooner perceived that preference which Mrs Blifil gave to Tom, than that poor youth (however innocent) began to sink in his affections as he rose in hers. This, it is true, would of itself alone never have been able to eradicate Jones from his bosom; but it was greatly injurious to him, and prepared Mr Allworthy's mind for those impressions which afterwards produced the mighty events that will be contained hereafter in this history; and to which, it must be confest, the unfortunate lad, by his own wantonness, wildness, and want of caution, too much contributed.
111
In recording some instances of these, we shall, if rightly understood, afford a very useful lesson to those well-disposed youths who shall hereafter be our readers; for they may here find, that goodness of heart, and openness of temper, though these may give them great comfort within, and administer to an honest pride in their own minds, will by no means, alas! do their business in the world. Prudence and circumspection are necessary even to the best of men. They are indeed, as it were, a guard to Virtue, without which she can never be safe. It is not enough that your designs, nay, that your actions, are intrinsically good; you must take care they shall appear so. If your inside be never so beautiful, you must preserve a fair outside also. This must be constantly looked to, or malice and envy will take care to blacken it so, that the sagacity and goodness of an Allworthy will not be able to see through it, and to discern the beauties within. Let this, my young readers, be your constant maxim, that no man can be good enough to enable him to neglect the rules of prudence; nor will Virtue herself look beautiful, unless she be bedecked with the outward ornaments of decency and decorum. And this precept, my worthy disciples, if you read with due attention, you will, I hope, find sufficiently enforced by examples in the following pages.
I ask pardon for this short appearance, by way of chorus, on the stage. It is in reality for my own sake, that, while I am discovering the rocks on which innocence and goodness often split, I may not be misunderstood to recommend the very means to my worthy readers, by which I intend to show them they will be undone. And this, as I could not prevail on any of my actors to speak, I myself was obliged to declare.

Chapter V?
A childish incident, in which, however, is seen a good-natured disposition in Tom Jones.
The reader may remember that Mr Allworthy gave Tom Jones a little horse, as a kind of smart-money for the punishment which he imagined he had suffered innocently.
This horse Tom kept above half a year, and then rode him to a neighbouring fair, and sold him.
At his return, being questioned by Thwackum what he had done with the money for which the horse was sold, he frankly declared he would not tell him.
"Oho!" says Thwackum, "you will not! then I will have it out of your br一h;" that being the place to which he always applied for information on every doubtful occasion.
Tom was now mounted on the back of a footman, and everything prepared for execution, when Mr Allworthy, entering the room, gave the criminal a reprieve, and took him with him into another apartment; where, being alone with Tom, he put the same question to him which Thwackum had before asked him.
Tom answered, he could in duty refuse him nothing; but as for that tyrannical rascal, he would never make him any other answer than with a cudgel, with which he hoped soon to be able to pay him for all his barbarities.
Mr Allworthy very severely reprimanded the lad for his indecent and disrespectful expressions concerning his master; but much more for his avowing an intention of revenge. He threatened him with the entire loss of his favour, if he ever heard such another word from his mouth; for, he said, he would never support or befriend a reprobate. By these and the like declarations, he extorted some compunction from Tom, in which that youth was not over-sincere; for he really meditated some return for all the smarting favours he had received at the hands of the pedagogue.
113
He was, however, brought by Mr Allworthy to express a concern for his resentment against Thwackum; and then the good man, after some wholesome admonition, permitted him to proceed, which he did as follows:一
"Indeed, my dear sir, I love and honour you more than all the world: I know the great obligations I have to you, and should detest myself if I thought my heart was capable of ingratitude. Could the little horse you gave me speak, I am sure he could tell you how fond I was of your present; for I had more pleasure in feeding him than in riding him. Indeed, sir, it went to my heart to part with him; nor would I have sold him upon any other account in the world than what I did. You yourself, sir, I am convinced, in my case, would have done the same: for none ever so sensibly felt the misfortunes of others. What would you feel, dear sir, if you thought yourself the occasion of them? Indeed, sir, there never was any misery like theirs."
"Like whose, child?" says Allworthy: "What do you mean?"
"Oh, sir!" answered Tom, "your poor gamekeeper, with all his large family, ever since your discarding him, have been perishing with all the miseries of cold and hunger: I could not bear to see these poor wretches naked and starving, and at the same time know myself to have been the occasion of all their sufferings. I could not bear it, sir; upon my soul, I could not." [Here the tears ran down his cheeks, and he thus proceeded.] "It was to save them from absolute destruction I parted with your dear present, notwithstanding all the value I had for it: I sold the horse for them, and they have every farthing of the money."
Mr Allworthy now stood silent for some moments, and before he spoke the tears started from his eyes. He at length dismissed Tom with a gentle rebuke, advising him for the future to apply to him in cases of distress, rather than to use extraordinary means of relieving them himself.
This affair was afterwards the subject of much debate between Thwackum and Square. Thwackum held, that this was flying in Mr Allworthy's face, who had intended to punish the fellow for his disobedience. He said, in some instances, what the world called charity appeared to him to be opposing the will of the Almighty, which had marked some particular persons for destruction; and that this was in like manner acting in opposition to Mr Allworthy; concluding, as usual, with a hearty recommendation of birch.
Square argued strongly on the other side, in opposition perhaps to Th-wackum, or in compliance with Mr Allworthy, who seemed very much
114
to approve what Jones had done. As to what he urged on this occasion, as I am convinced most of my readers will be much abler advocates for poor Jones, it would be impertinent to relate it. Indeed it was not difficult to reconcile to the rule of right an action which it would have been impossible to deduce from the rule of wrong.

Chapter J
Containing an incident of a more heinous kind, with the comments of Thwackum and Square.
It hath been observed by some man of much greater reputation for wisdom than myself, that misfortunes seldom come single. An instance of this may, I believe, be seen in those gentlemen who have the misfortune to have any of their rogueries detected; for here discovery seldom stops till the whole is come out. Thus it happened to poor Tom; who was no sooner pardoned for selling the horse, than he was discovered to have some time before sold a fine Bible which Mr Allworthy gave him, the money arising from which sale he had disposed of in the same manner. This Bible Master Blifil had purchased, though he had already such another of his own, partly out of respect for the book, and partly out of friendship to Tom, being unwilling that the Bible should be sold out of the family at half-price. He therefore deposited the said half-price himself; for he was a very prudent lad, and so careful of his money, that he had laid up almost every penny which he had received from Mr Allworthy.
Some people have been noted to be able to read in no book but their own. On the contrary, from the time when Master Blifil was first possessed of this Bible, he never used any other. Nay, he was seen reading in it much oftener than he had before been in his own. Now, as he frequently asked Thwackum to explain difficult passages to him, that gentleman unfortunately took notice of Tom's name, which was written in many parts of the book. This brought on an inquiry, which obliged Master Blifil to discover the whole matter.
Thwackum was resolved a crime of this kind, which he called sacrilege, should not go unpunished. He therefore proceeded immediately to castigation: and not contented with that he acquainted Mr Allworthy, at their next meeting, with this monstrous crime, as it appeared to him: inveighing against Tom in the most bitter terms, and likening him to the buyers and sellers who were driven out of the temple.
116
Square saw this matter in a very different light. He said, he could not perceive any higher crime in selling one book than in selling another. That to sell Bibles was strictly lawful by all laws both Divine and human, and consequently there was no unfitness in it. He told Thwackum, that his great concern on this occasion brought to his mind the story of a very devout woman, who, out of pure regard to religion, stole Tillotson's Sermons from a lady of her acquaintance.
This story caused a vast quantity of blood to rush into the parson's face, which of itself was none of the palest; and he was going to reply with great warmth and anger, had not Mrs Blifil, who was present at this debate, interposed. That lady declared herself absolutely of Mr Square's side. She argued, indeed, very learnedly in support of his opinion; and concluded with saying, if Tom had been guilty of any fault, she must confess her own son appeared to be equally culpable; for that she could see no difference between the buyer and the seller; both of whom were alike to be driven out of the temple.
Mrs Blifil having declared her opinion, put an end to the debate. Square's triumph would almost have stopt his words, had he needed them; and Thwackum, who, for reasons before-mentioned, durst not venture at disobliging the lady, was almost choaked with indignation. As to Mr Allworthy, he said, since the boy had been already punished he would not deliver his sentiments on the occasion; and whether he was or was not angry with the lad, I must leave to the reader's own conjecture.
Soon after this, an action was brought against the gamekeeper by Squire Western (the gentleman in whose manor the partridge was killed), for depredations of the like kind. This was a most unfortunate circumstance for the fellow, as it not only of itself threatened his ruin, but actually prevented Mr Allworthy from restoring him to his favour: for as that gentleman was walking out one evening with Master Blifil and young Jones, the latter slily drew him to the habitation of Black George; where the family of that poor wretch, namely, his wife and children, were found in all the misery with which cold, hunger, and nakedness, can affect human creatures: for as to the money they had received from Jones, former debts had consumed almost the whole.
Such a scene as this could not fail of affecting the heart of Mr Allworthy. He immediately gave the mother a couple of guineas, with which he bid her cloath her children. The poor woman burst into tears at this goodness, and while she was thanking him, could not refrain from expressing her gratitude to Tom; who had, she said, long preserved both
117
her and hers from starving. "We have not," says she, "had a morsel to eat, nor have these poor children had a rag to put on, but what his goodness hath bestowed on us." For, indeed, besides the horse and the Bible, Tom had sacrificed a night-gown, and other things, to the use of this distressed family.
On their return home, Tom made use of all his eloquence to display the wretchedness of these people, and the penitence of Black George himself; and in this he succeeded so well, that Mr Allworthy said, he thought the man had suffered enough for what was past; that he would forgive him, and think of some means of providing for him and his family.
Jones was so delighted with this news, that, though it was dark when they returned home, he could not help going back a mile, in a shower of rain, to acquaint the poor woman with the glad tidings; but, like other hasty divulgers of news, he only brought on himself the trouble of contradicting it: for the ill fortune of Black George made use of the very opportunity of his friend's absence to overturn all again.
118

Chapter A Vx
In which Master Blifil and Jones appear in different lights.
Master Blifil fell very short of his companion in the amiable quality of mercy; but he as greatly exceeded him in one of a much higher kind, namely, in justice: in which he followed both the precepts and example of Thwackum and Square; for though they would both make frequent use of the word mercy, yet it was plain that in reality Square held it to be inconsistent with the rule of right; and Thwackum was for doing justice, and leaving mercy to heaven. The two gentlemen did indeed somewhat differ in opinion concerning the objects of this sublime virtue; by which Thwackum would probably have destroyed one half of mankind, and Square the other half.
Master Blifil then, though he had kept silence in the presence of Jones, yet, when he had better considered the matter, could by no means endure the thought of suffering his uncle to confer favours on the undeserving. He therefore resolved immediately to acquaint him with the fact which we have above slightly hinted to the readers. The truth of which was as follows:
The gamekeeper, about a year after he was dismissed from Mr Allworthy's service, and before Tom's selling the horse, being in want of bread, either to fill his own mouth or those of his family, as he passed through a field belonging to Mr Western espied a hare sitting in her form. This hare he had basely and barbarously knocked on the head, against the laws of the land, and no less against the laws of sportsmen.
The higgler to whom the hare was sold, being unfortunately taken many months after with a quantity of game upon him, was obliged to make his peace with the squire, by becoming evidence against some poacher. And now Black George was pitched upon by him, as being a person already obnoxious to Mr Western, and one of no good fame in the country. He was, besides, the best sacrifice the higgler could make, as he had supplied him with no game since; and by this means the witness had
119
an opportunity of screening his better customers: for the squire, being charmed with the power of punishing Black George, whom a single transgression was sufficient to ruin, made no further enquiry.
Had this fact been truly laid before Mr Allworthy, it might probably have done the gamekeeper very little mischief. But there is no zeal blinder than that which is inspired with the love of justice against offenders. Master Blifil had forgot the distance of the time. He varied likewise in the manner of the fact: and by the hasty addition of the single letter S he considerably altered the story; for he said that George had wired hares. These alterations might probably have been set right, had not Master Blifil unluckily insisted on a promise of secrecy from Mr Allworthy before he revealed the matter to him; but by that means the poor gamekeeper was condemned without having an opportunity to defend himself: for as the fact of killing the hare, and of the action brought, were certainly true, Mr Allworthy had no doubt concerning the rest.
Short-lived then was the joy of these poor people; for Mr Allworthy the next morning declared he had fresh reason, without assigning it, for his anger, and strictly forbad Tom to mention George any more: though as for his family, he said he would endeavour to keep them from starving; but as to the fellow himself, he would leave him to the laws, which nothing could keep him from breaking.
Tom could by no means divine what had incensed Mr Allworthy, for of Master Blifil he had not the least suspicion. However, as his friendship was to be tired out by no disappointments, he now determined to try another method of preserving the poor gamekeeper from ruin.
Jones was lately grown very intimate with Mr Western. He had so greatly recommended himself to that gentleman, by leaping over five-barred gates, and by other acts of sportsmanship, that the squire had declared Tom would certainly make a great man if he had but sufficient encouragement. He often wished he had himself a son with such parts; and one day very solemnly asserted at a drinking bout, that Tom should hunt a pack of hounds for a thousand pound of his money, with any huntsman in the whole country.
By such kind of talents he had so ingratiated himself with the squire, that he was a most welcome guest at his table, and a favourite companion in his sport: everything which the squire held most dear, to wit, his guns, dogs, and horses, were now as much at the command of Jones, as if they had been his own. He resolved therefore to make use of this favour on behalf of his friend Black George, whom he hoped to introduce into
120
Mr Western's family, in the same capacity in which he had before served Mr Allworthy.
The reader, if he considers that this fellow was already obnoxious to Mr Western, and if he considers farther the weighty business by which that gentleman's displeasure had been incurred, will perhaps condemn this as a foolish and desperate undertaking; but if he should totally condemn young Jones on that account, he will greatly applaud him for strengthening himself with all imaginable interest on so arduous an occasion.
For this purpose, then, Tom applied to Mr Western's daughter, a young lady of about seventeen years of age, whom her father, next after those necessary implements of sport just before mentioned, loved and esteemed above all the world. Now, as she had some influence on the squire, so Tom had some little influence on her. But this being the intended heroine of this work, a lady with whom we ourselves are greatly in love, and with whom many of our readers will probably be in love too, before we part, it is by no means proper she should make her appearance at the end of a book.
121
Part 4
122

Chapter 且
Containing five pages of paper.
As truth distinguishes our writings from those idle romances which are filled with monsters, the productions, not of nature, but of distempered brains; and which have been therefore recommended by an eminent critic to the sole use of the pastry-cook; so, on the other hand, we would avoid any resemblance to that kind of history which a celebrated poet seems to think is no less calculated for the emolument of the brewer, as the reading it should be always attended with a tankard of good ale一
While一history with her comrade ale, Soothes the sad series of her serious tale
For as this is the liquor of modern historians, nay, perhaps their muse, if we may believe the opinion of Butler, who attributes inspiration to ale, it ought likewise to be the potation of their readers, since every book ought to be read with the same spirit and in the same manner as it is writ. Thus the famous author of Hurlothrumbo told a learned bishop, that the reason his lordship could not taste the excellence of his piece was, that he did not read it with a fiddle in his hand; which instrument he himself had always had in his own, when he composed it.
That our work, therefore, might be in no danger of being likened to the labours of these historians, we have taken every occasion of interspersing through the whole sundry similes, descriptions, and other kind of poetical embellishments. These are, indeed, designed to supply the place of the said ale, and to refresh the mind, whenever those slumbers, which in a long work are apt to invade the reader as well as the writer, shall begin to creep upon him. Without interruptions of this kind, the best narrative of plain matter of fact must overpower every reader; for nothing but the ever lasting watchfulness, which Homer has ascribed only to Jove himself, can be proof against a newspaper of many volumes.
123
We shall leave to the reader to determine with what judgment we have chosen the several occasions for inserting those ornamental parts of our work. Surely it will be allowed that none could be more proper than the present, where we are about to introduce a considerable character on the scene; no less, indeed, than the heroine of this heroic, historical, prosaic poem. Here, therefore, we have thought proper to prepare the mind of the reader for her reception, by filling it with every pleasing image which we can draw from the face of nature. And for this method we plead many precedents. First, this is an art well known to, and much practised by, our tragick poets, who seldom fail to prepare their audience for the reception of their principal characters.
Thus the heroe is always introduced with a flourish of drums and trumpets, in order to rouse a martial spirit in the audience, and to accommodate their ears to bombast and fustian, which Mr Locke's blind man would not have grossly erred in likening to the sound of a trumpet. Again, when lovers are coming forth, soft music often conducts them on the stage, either to soothe the audience with the softness of the tender passion, or to lull and prepare them for that gentle slumber in which they will most probably be composed by the ensuing scene.
And not only the poets, but the masters of these poets, the managers of playhouses, seem to be in this secret; for, besides the aforesaid kettledrums, &amp;c., which denote the heroe's approach, he is generally ushered on the stage by a large troop of half a dozen scene-shifters; and how necessary these are imagined to his appearance, may be concluded from the following theatrical story:一
King Pyrrhus was at dinner at an ale-house bordering on the theatre, when he was summoned to go on the stage. The heroe, being unwilling to quit his shoulder of mutton, and as unwilling to draw on himself the indignation of Mr Wilks (his brother-manager) for making the audience wait, had bribed these his harbingers to be out of the way. While Mr Wilks, therefore, was thundering out, "Where are the carpenters to walk on before King Pyrrhus?" that monarch very quietly eat his mutton, and the audience, however impatient, were obliged to entertain themselves with music in his absence.
To be plain, I much question whether the politician, who hath generally a good nose, hath not scented out somewhat of the utility of this practice. I am convinced that awful magistrate my lord-mayor contracts a good deal of that reverence which attends him through the year, by the several pageants which precede his pomp. Nay, I must confess, that even
124
I myself, who am not remarkably liable to be captivated with show, have yielded not a little to the impressions of much preceding state. When I have seen a man strutting in a procession, after others whose business was only to walk before him, I have conceived a higher notion of his dignity than I have felt on seeing him in a common situation. But there is one instance, which comes exactly up to my purpose. This is the custom of sending on a basket-woman, who is to precede the pomp at a coronation, and to strew the stage with flowers, before the great personages begin their procession. The antients would certainly have invoked the goddess Flora for this purpose, and it would have been no difficulty for their priests, or politicians to have persuaded the people of the real presence of the deity, though a plain mortal had personated her and performed her office. But we have no such design of imposing on our reader; and therefore those who object to the heathen theology, may, if they please, change our goddess into the above-mentioned basket-woman. Our intention, in short, is to introduce our heroine with the utmost solemnity in our power, with an elevation of stile, and all other circumstances proper to raise the veneration of our reader.一Indeed we would, for certain causes, advise those of our male readers who have any hearts, to read no farther, were we not well assured, that how amiable soever the picture of our heroine will appear, as it is really a copy from nature, many of our fair countrywomen will be found worthy to satisfy any passion, and to answer any idea of female perfection which our pencil will be able to raise.
And now, without any further preface, we proceed to our next chapter.
125

Chapter
A short hint of what we can do in the sublime, and a description of Miss Sophia Western.
Hushed be every ruder breath. May the heathen ruler of the winds confine in iron chains the boisterous limbs of noisy Boreas, and the sharp-pointed nose of bitter-biting Eurus. Do thou, sweet Zephyrus, rising from thy fragrant bed, mount the western sky, and lead on those delicious gales, the charms of which call forth the lovely Flora from her chamber, perfumed with pearly dews, when on the 1st of June, her birthday, the blooming maid, in loose attire, gently trips it over the verdant mead, where every flower rises to do her homage, till the whole field becomes enamelled, and colours contend with sweets which shall ravish her most.
So charming may she now appear! and you the feathered choristers of nature, whose sweetest notes not even Handel can excell, tune your melodious throats to celebrate her appearance. From love proceeds your music, and to love it returns. Awaken therefore that gentle passion in every swain: for lo! adorned with all the charms in which nature can array her; bedecked with beauty, youth, sprightliness, innocence, modesty, and tenderness, breathing sweetness from her rosy lips, and darting brightness from her sparkling eyes, the lovely Sophia comes!
Reader, perhaps thou hast seen the statue of the Venus de Medicis. Perhaps, too, thou hast seen the gallery of beauties at Hampton Court. Thou may'st remember each bright Churchill of the galaxy, and all the toasts of the Kit-cat. Or, if their reign was before thy times, at least thou hast seen their daughters, the no less dazzling beauties of the present age; whose names, should we here insert, we apprehend they would fill the whole volume.
Now if thou hast seen all these, be not afraid of the rude answer which Lord Rochester once gave to a man who had seen many things. No. If
126
thou hast seen all these without knowing what beauty is, thou hast no eyes; if without feeling its power, thou hast no heart.
Yet is it possible, my friend, that thou mayest have seen all these without being able to form an exact idea of Sophia; for she did not exactly resemble any of them. She was most like the picture of Lady Ranelagh: and, I have heard, more still to the famous dutchess of Mazarine; but most of all she resembled one whose image never can depart from my breast, and whom, if thou dost remember, thou hast then, my friend, an adequate idea of Sophia.
But lest this should not have been thy fortune, we will endeavour with our utmost skill to describe this paragon, though we are sensible that our highest abilities are very inadequate to the task.
Sophia, then, the only daughter of Mr Western, was a middle-sized woman; but rather inclining to tall. Her shape was not only exact, but extremely delicate: and the nice proportion of her arms promised the truest symmetry in her limbs. Her hair, which was black, was so luxuriant, that it reached her middle, before she cut it to comply with the modern fashion; and it was now curled so gracefully in her neck, that few could believe it to be her own. If envy could find any part of the face which demanded less commendation than the rest, it might possibly think her forehead might have been higher without prejudice to her. Her eyebrows were full, even, and arched beyond the power of art to imitate. Her black eyes had a lustre in them, which all her softness could not extinguish. Her nose was exactly regular, and her mouth, in which were two rows of ivory, exactly answered Sir John Suckling's description in those lines:一
Her lips were red, and one was thin, Compar'd to that was next her chin. Some bee had stung it newly.
Her cheeks were of the oval kind; and in her right she had a dimple, which the least smile discovered. Her chin had certainly its share in forming the beauty of her face; but it was difficult to say it was either large or small, though perhaps it was rather of the former kind. Her complexion had rather more of the lily than of the rose; but when exercise or modesty increased her natural colour, no vermilion could equal it. Then one might indeed cry out with the celebrated Dr Donne:
一Her pure and eloquent blood Spoke in her cheeks, and so distinctly wrought That one might almost say her body thought.
Her neck was long and finely turned: and here, if I was not afraid of offending her delicacy, I might justly say, the highest beauties of the famous Venus de Medicis were outdone. Here was whiteness which no lilies,
127
ivory, nor alabaster could match. The finest cambric might indeed be supposed from envy to cover that bosom which was much whiter than itself.一It was indeed,
Nitor splendens Pario marmore purius.
A gloss shining beyond the purest brightness of Parian marble.
Such was the outside of Sophia; nor was this beautiful frame disgraced by an inhabitant unworthy of it. Her mind was every way equal to her person; nay, the latter borrowed some charms from the former; for when she smiled, the sweetness of her temper diffused that glory over her countenance which no regularity of features can give. But as there are no perfections of the mind which do not discover themselves in that perfect intimacy to which we intend to introduce our reader with this charming young creature, so it is needless to mention them here: nay, it is a kind of tacit affront to our reader's understanding, and may also rob him of that pleasure which he will receive in forming his own judgment of her character.
It may, however, be proper to say, that whatever mental accomplishments she had derived from nature, they were somewhat improved and cultivated by art: for she had been educated under the care of an aunt, who was a lady of great discretion, and was thoroughly acquainted with the world, having lived in her youth about the court, whence she had retired some years since into the country. By her conversation and instructions, Sophia was perfectly well bred, though perhaps she wanted a little of that ease in her behaviour which is to be acquired only by habit, and living within what is called the polite circle. But this, to say the truth, is often too dearly purchased; and though it hath charms so inexpressible, that the French, perhaps, among other qualities, mean to express this, when they declare they know not what it is; yet its absence is well compensated by innocence; nor can good sense and a natural gentility ever stand in need of it.

Chapter U
Wherein the history goes back to commemorate a trifling incident that happened some years since; but which, trifling as it was, had some future consequences.
The amiable Sophia was now in her eighteenth year, when she is introduced into this history. Her father, as hath been said, was fonder of her than of any other human creature. To her, therefore, Tom Jones applied, in order to engage her interest on the behalf of his friend the gamekeeper.
But before we proceed to this business, a short recapitulation of some previous matters may be necessary.
Though the different tempers of Mr Allworthy and of Mr Western did not admit of a very intimate correspondence, yet they lived upon what is called a decent footing together; by which means the young people of both families had been acquainted from their infancy; and as they were all near of the same age, had been frequent playmates together.
The gaiety of Tom's temper suited better with Sophia, than the grave and sober disposition of Master Blifil. And the preference which she gave the former of these, would often appear so plainly, that a lad of a more passionate turn than Master Blifil was, might have shown some displeasure at it.
As he did not, however, outwardly express any such disgust, it would be an ill office in us to pay a visit to the inmost recesses of his mind, as some scandalous people search into the most secret affairs of their friends, and often pry into their closets and cupboards, only to discover their poverty and meanness to the world.
However, as persons who suspect they have given others cause of offence, are apt to conclude they are offended; so Sophia imputed an action of Master Blifil to his anger, which the superior sagacity of Thwackum and Square discerned to have arisen from a much better principle.
129
Tom Jones, when very young, had presented Sophia with a little bird, which he had taken from the nest, had nursed up, and taught to sing.
Of this bird, Sophia, then about thirteen years old, was so extremely fond, that her chief business was to feed and tend it, and her chief pleasure to play with it. By these means little Tommy, for so the bird was called, was become so tame, that it would feed out of the hand of its mistress, would perch upon the finger, and lie contented in her bosom, where it seemed almost sensible of its own happiness; though she always kept a small string about its leg, nor would ever trust it with the liberty of flying away.
One day, when Mr Allworthy and his whole family dined at Mr Western's, Master Blifil, being in the garden with little Sophia, and observing the extreme fondness that she showed for her little bird, desired her to trust it for a moment in his hands. Sophia presently complied with the young gentleman's request, and after some previous caution, delivered him her bird; of which he was no sooner in possession, than he slipt the string from its leg and tossed it into the air.
The foolish animal no sooner perceived itself at liberty, than forgetting all the favours it had received from Sophia, it flew directly from her, and perched on a bough at some distance.
Sophia, seeing her bird gone, screamed out so loud, that Tom Jones, who was at a little distance, immediately ran to her assistance.
He was no sooner informed of what had happened, than he cursed Bli-fil for a pitiful malicious rascal; and then immediately stripping off his coat he applied himself to climbing the tree to which the bird escaped.
Tom had almost recovered his little namesake, when the branch on which it was perched, and that hung over a canal, broke, and the poor lad plumped over head and ears into the water.
Sophia's concern now changed its object. And as she apprehended the boy's life was in danger, she screamed ten times louder than before; and indeed Master Blifil himself now seconded her with all the vociferation in his power.
The company, who were sitting in a room next the garden, were instantly alarmed, and came all forth; but just as they reached the canal, Tom (for the water was luckily pretty shallow in that part) arrived safely on shore.
Thwackum fell violently on poor Tom, who stood dropping and shivering before him, when Mr Allworthy desired him to have patience; and
130
turning to Master Blifil, said, "Pray, child, what is the reason of all this disturbance?"
Master Blifil answered, "Indeed, uncle, I am very sorry for what I have done; I have been unhappily the occasion of it all. I had Miss Sophia's bird in my hand, and thinking the poor creature languished for liberty, I own I could not forbear giving it what it desired; for I always thought there was something very cruel in confining anything. It seemed to be against the law of nature, by which everything hath a right to liberty; nay, it is even unchristian, for it is not doing what we would be done by; but if I had imagined Miss Sophia would have been so much concerned at it, I am sure I never would have done it; nay, if I had known what would have happened to the bird itself: for when Master Jones, who climbed up that tree after it, fell into the water, the bird took a second flight, and presently a nasty hawk carried it away."
Poor Sophia, who now first heard of her little Tommy's fate (for her concern for Jones had prevented her perceiving it when it happened), shed a shower of tears. These Mr Allworthy endeavoured to assuage, promising her a much finer bird: but she declared she would never have another. Her father chid her for crying so for a foolish bird; but could not help telling young Blifil, if he was a son of his, his backside should be well flead.
Sophia now returned to her chamber, the two young gentlemen were sent home, and the rest of the company returned to their bottle; where a conversation ensued on the subject of the bird, so curious, that we think it deserves a chapter by itself.
131
Containing such very deep and grave matters, that some readers, perhaps, may not relish it.
Square had no sooner lighted his pipe, than, addressing himself to Allworthy, he thus began: "Sir, I cannot help congratulating you on your nephew; who, at an age when few lads have any ideas but of sensible objects, is arrived at a capacity of distinguishing right from wrong. To confine anything, seems to me against the law of nature, by which everything hath a right to liberty. These were his words; and the impression they have made on me is never to be eradicated. Can any man have a higher notion of the rule of right, and the eternal fitness of things? I cannot help promising myself, from such a dawn, that the meridian of this youth will be equal to that of either the elder or the younger Brutus."
Here Thwackum hastily interrupted, and spilling some of his wine, and swallowing the rest with great eagerness, answered, "From another expression he made use of, I hope he will resemble much better men. The law of nature is a jargon of words, which means nothing. I know not of any such law, nor of any right which can be derived from it. To do as we would be done by, is indeed a Christian motive, as the boy well expressed himself; and I am glad to find my instructions have borne such good fruit."
"If vanity was a thing fit," says Square, "I might indulge some on the same occasion; for whence only he can have learnt his notions of right or wrong, I think is pretty apparent. If there be no law of nature, there is no right nor wrong."
"How!" says the parson, "do you then banish revelation? Am I talking with a deist or an atheist?"
"Drink about," says Western. "Pox of your laws of nature! I don't know what you mean, either of you, by right and wrong. To take away my girl's bird was wrong, in my opinion; and my neighbour Allworthy may
132
do as he pleases; but to encourage boys in such practices, is to breed them up to the gallows."
Allworthy answered, "That he was sorry for what his nephew had done, but could not consent to punish him, as he acted rather from a generous than unworthy motive." He said, "If the boy had stolen the bird, none would have been more ready to vote for a severe chastisement than himself; but it was plain that was not his design:" and, indeed, it was as apparent to him, that he could have no other view but what he had himself avowed. (For as to that malicious purpose which Sophia suspected, it never once entered into the head of Mr Allworthy.) He at length concluded with again blaming the action as inconsiderate, and which, he said, was pardonable only in a child.
Square had delivered his opinion so openly, that if he was now silent, he must submit to have his judgment censured. He said, therefore, with some warmth, "That Mr Allworthy had too much respect to the dirty consideration of property. That in passing our judgments on great and mighty actions, all private regards should be laid aside; for by adhering to those narrow rules, the younger Brutus had been condemned of ingratitude, and the elder of parricide."
"And if they had been hanged too for those crimes," cried Thwackum, "they would have had no more than their deserts. A couple of heathenish villains! Heaven be praised we have no Brutuses now-a-days! I wish, Mr Square, you would desist from filling the minds of my pupils with such antichristian stuff; for the consequence must be, while they are under my care, its being well scourged out of them again. There is your disciple Tom almost spoiled already. I overheard him the other day disputing with Master Blifil that there was no merit in faith without works. I know that is one of your tenets, and I suppose he had it from you."
"Don't accuse me of spoiling him," says Square. "Who taught him to laugh at whatever is virtuous and decent, and fit and right in the nature of things? He is your own scholar, and I disclaim him. No, no, Master Blifil is my boy. Young as he is, that lad's notions of moral rectitude I defy you ever to eradicate."
Thwackum put on a contemptuous sneer at this, and replied, "Ay, ay, I will venture him with you. He is too well grounded for all your philosophical cant to hurt. No, no, I have taken care to instil such principles into him—"
"And I have instilled principles into him too," cries Square. "What but the sublime idea of virtue could inspire a human mind with the generous
133
thought of giving liberty? And I repeat to you again, if it was a fit thing to be proud, I might claim the honour of having infused that idea."一
"And if pride was not forbidden," said Thwackum, "I might boast of having taught him that duty which he himself assigned as his motive."
"So between you both," says the squire, "the young gentleman hath been taught to rob my daughter of her bird. I find I must take care of my partridge-mew. I shall have some virtuous religious man or other set all my partridges at liberty." Then slapping a gentleman of the law, who was present, on the back, he cried out, "What say you to this, Mr Counsellor? Is not this against law?"
The lawyer with great gravity delivered himself as follows:一
"If the case be put of a partridge, there can be no doubt but an action would lie; for though this be ferae naturae, yet being reclaimed, property vests: but being the case of a singing bird, though reclaimed, as it is a thing of base nature, it must be considered as nullius in bonis. In this case, therefore, I conceive the plaintiff must be non-suited; and I should disad-vise the bringing any such action."
"Well," says the squire, "if it be nullus bonus, let us drink about, and talk a little of the state of the nation, or some such discourse that we all understand; for I am sure I don't understand a word of this. It may be learning and sense for aught I know: but you shall never persuade me into it. Pox! you have neither of you mentioned a word of that poor lad who deserves to be commended: to venture breaking his neck to oblige my girl was a generous-spirited action: I have learning enough to see that. D一n me, here's Tom's health! I shall love the boy for it the longest day I have to live."
Thus was the debate interrupted; but it would probably have been soon resumed, had not Mr Allworthy presently called for his coach, and carried off the two combatants.
Such was the conclusion of this adventure of the bird, and of the dialogue occasioned by it; which we could not help recounting to our reader, though it happened some years before that stage or period of time at which our history is now arrived.

Chapter U
Containing matter accommodated to every taste.
"Parva leves capiunt animos一Small things affect light minds," was the sentiment of a great master of the passion of love. And certain it is, that from this day Sophia began to have some little kindness for Tom Jones, and no little aversion for his companion.
Many accidents from time to time improved both these passions in her breast; which, without our recounting, the reader may well conclude, from what we have before hinted of the different tempers of these lads, and how much the one suited with her own inclinations more than the other. To say the truth, Sophia, when very young, discerned that Tom, though an idle, thoughtless, rattling rascal, was nobody's enemy but his own; and that Master Blifil, though a prudent, discreet, sober young gentleman, was at the same time strongly attached to the interest only of one single person; and who that single person was the reader will be able to divine without any assistance of ours.
These two characters are not always received in the world with the different regard which seems severally due to either; and which one would imagine mankind, from self-interest, should show towards them. But perhaps there may be a political reason for it: in finding one of a truly benevolent disposition, men may very reasonably suppose they have found a treasure, and be desirous of keeping it, like all other good things, to themselves. Hence they may imagine, that to trumpet forth the praises of such a person, would, in the vulgar phrase, be crying Roast-meat, and calling in partakers of what they intend to apply solely to their own use. If this reason does not satisfy the reader, I know no other means of accounting for the little respect which I have commonly seen paid to a character which really does great honour to human nature, and is productive of the highest good to society. But it was otherwise with Sophia. She honoured Tom Jones, and scorned Master Blifil, almost as soon as she knew the meaning of those two words.
135
Sophia had been absent upwards of three years with her aunt; during all which time she had seldom seen either of these young gentlemen. She dined, however, once, together with her aunt, at Mr Allworthy's. This was a few days after the adventure of the partridge, before commemorated. Sophia heard the whole story at table, where she said nothing: nor indeed could her aunt get many words from her as she returned home; but her maid, when undressing her, happening to say, "Well, miss, I suppose you have seen young Master Blifil to-day?" she answered with much passion, "I hate the name of Master Blifil, as I do whatever is base and treacherous: and I wonder Mr Allworthy would suffer that old barbarous schoolmaster to punish a poor boy so cruelly for what was only the effect of his good-nature." She then recounted the story to her maid, and concluded with saying, "Don't you think he is a boy of noble spirit?"
This young lady was now returned to her father; who gave her the command of his house, and placed her at the upper end of his table, where Tom (who for his great love of hunting was become a great favourite of the squire) often dined. Young men of open, generous dispositions are naturally inclined to gallantry, which, if they have good understandings, as was in reality Tom's case, exerts itself in an obliging complacent behaviour to all women in general. This greatly distinguished Tom from the boisterous brutality of mere country squires on the one hand, and from the solemn and somewhat sullen deportment of Master Blifil on the other; and he began now, at twenty, to have the name of a pretty fellow among all the women in the neighbourhood.
Tom behaved to Sophia with no particularity, unless perhaps by showing her a higher respect than he paid to any other. This distinction her beauty, fortune, sense, and amiable carriage, seemed to demand; but as to design upon her person he had none; for which we shall at present suffer the reader to condemn him of stupidity; but perhaps we shall be able indifferently well to account for it hereafter.
Sophia, with the highest degree of innocence and modesty, had a remarkable sprightliness in her temper. This was so greatly increased whenever she was in company with Tom, that had he not been very young and thoughtless, he must have observed it: or had not Mr Western's thoughts been generally either in the field, the stable, or the dog-kennel, it might have perhaps created some jealousy in him: but so far was the good gentleman from entertaining any such suspicions, that he gave Tom every opportunity with his daughter which any lover could have wished; and this Tom innocently improved to better advantage, by following only the dictates of his natural gallantry and good-nature, than
136
he might perhaps have done had he had the deepest designs on the young lady.
But indeed it can occasion little wonder that this matter escaped the observation of others, since poor Sophia herself never remarked it; and her heart was irretrievably lost before she suspected it was in danger.
Matters were in this situation, when Tom, one afternoon, finding Sophia alone, began, after a short apology, with a very serious face, to acquaint her that he had a favour to ask of her which he hoped her goodness would comply with.
Though neither the young man's behaviour, nor indeed his manner of opening this business, were such as could give her any just cause of suspecting he intended to make love to her; yet whether Nature whispered something into her ear, or from what cause it arose I will not determine; certain it is, some idea of that kind must have intruded itself; for her colour forsook her cheeks, her limbs trembled, and her tongue would have faltered, had Tom stopped for an answer; but he soon relieved her from her perplexity, by proceeding to inform her of his request; which was to solicit her interest on behalf of the gamekeeper, whose own ruin, and that of a large family, must be, he said, the consequence of Mr Western's pursuing his action against him.
Sophia presently recovered her confusion, and, with a smile full of sweetness, said, "Is this the mighty favour you asked with so much gravity? I will do it with all my heart. I really pity the poor fellow, and no longer ago than yesterday sent a small matter to his wife." This small matter was one of her gowns, some linen, and ten shillings in money, of which Tom had heard, and it had, in reality, put this solicitation into his head.
Our youth, now, emboldened with his success, resolved to push the matter farther, and ventured even to beg her recommendation of him to her father's service; protesting that he thought him one of the honestest fellows in the country, and extremely well qualified for the place of a gamekeeper, which luckily then happened to be vacant.
Sophia answered, "Well, I will undertake this too; but I cannot promise you as much success as in the former part, which I assure you I will not quit my father without obtaining. However, I will do what I can for the poor fellow; for I sincerely look upon him and his family as objects of great compassion. And now, Mr Jones, I must ask you a favour."
"A favour, madam!" cries Tom: "if you knew the pleasure you have given me in the hopes of receiving a command from you, you would
137
think by mentioning it you did confer the greatest favour on me; for by this dear hand I would sacrifice my life to oblige you."
He then snatched her hand, and eagerly kissed it, which was the first time his lips had ever touched her. The blood, which before had forsaken her cheeks, now made her sufficient amends, by rushing all over her face and neck with such violence, that they became all of a scarlet colour. She now first felt a sensation to which she had been before a stranger, and which, when she had leisure to reflect on it, began to acquaint her with some secrets, which the reader, if he doth not already guess them, will know in due time.
Sophia, as soon as she could speak (which was not instantly), informed him that the favour she had to desire of him was, not to lead her father through so many dangers in hunting; for that, from what she had heard, she was terribly frightened every time they went out together, and expected some day or other to see her father brought home with broken limbs. She therefore begged him, for her sake, to be more cautious; and as he well knew Mr Western would follow him, not to ride so madly, nor to take those dangerous leaps for the future.
Tom promised faithfully to obey her commands; and after thanking her for her kind compliance with his request, took his leave, and departed highly charmed with his success.
Poor Sophia was charmed too, but in a very different way. Her sensations, however, the reader's heart (if he or she have any) will better represent than I can, if I had as many mouths as ever poet wished for, to eat, I suppose, those many dainties with which he was so plentifully provided.
It was Mr Western's custom every afternoon, as soon as he was drunk, to hear his daughter play on the harpsichord; for he was a great lover of music, and perhaps, had he lived in town, might have passed for a connoisseur; for he always excepted against the finest compositions of Mr Handel. He never relished any music but what was light and airy; and indeed his most favourite tunes were Old Sir Simon the King, St George he was for England, Bobbing Joan, and some others.
His daughter, though she was a perfect mistress of music, and would never willingly have played any but Handel's, was so devoted to her father's pleasure, that she learnt all those tunes to oblige him. However, she would now and then endeavour to lead him into her own taste; and when he required the repetition of his ballads, would answer with a
138
"Nay, dear sir;" and would often beg him to suffer her to play something else.
This evening, however, when the gentleman was retired from his bottle, she played all his favourites three times over without any solicitation. This so pleased the good squire, that he started from his couch, gave his daughter a kiss, and swore her hand was greatly improved. She took this opportunity to execute her promise to Tom; in which she succeeded so well, that the squire declared, if she would give him t'other bout of Old Sir Simon, he would give the gamekeeper his deputation the next morning. Sir Simon was played again and again, till the charms of the music soothed Mr Western to sleep. In the morning Sophia did not fail to remind him of his engagement; and his attorney was immediately sent for, ordered to stop any further proceedings in the action, and to make out the deputation.
Tom's success in this affair soon began to ring over the country, and various were the censures passed upon it; some greatly applauding it as an act of good nature; others sneering, and saying, "No wonder that one idle fellow should love another." Young Blifil was greatly enraged at it. He had long hated Black George in the same proportion as Jones delighted in him; not from any offence which he had ever received, but from his great love to religion and virtue;一for Black George had the reputation of a loose kind of a fellow. Blifil therefore represented this as flying in Mr Allworthy's face; and declared, with great concern, that it was impossible to find any other motive for doing good to such a wretch.
Thwackum and Square likewise sung to the same tune. They were now (especially the latter) become greatly jealous of young Jones with the widow; for he now approached the age of twenty, was really a fine young fellow, and that lady, by her encouragements to him, seemed daily more and more to think him so.
Allworthy was not, however, moved with their malice. He declared himself very well satisfied with what Jones had done. He said the perseverance and integrity of his friendship was highly commendable, and he wished he could see more frequent instances of that virtue.
But Fortune, who seldom greatly relishes such sparks as my friend Tom, perhaps because they do not pay more ardent addresses to her, gave now a very different turn to all his actions, and showed them to Mr Allworthy in a light far less agreeable than that gentleman's goodness had hitherto seen them in.
139

An apology for the insensibility of Mr Jones to all the charms of the lovely Sophia; in which possibly we may, in a considerable degree, lower his character in the estimation of those men of wit and gallantry who approve the heroes in most of our modern comedies.
There are two sorts of people, who, I am afraid, have already conceived some contempt for my heroe, on account of his behaviour to Sophia. The former of these will blame his prudence in neglecting an opportunity to possess himself of Mr Western's fortune; and the latter will no less despise him for his backwardness to so fine a girl, who seemed ready to fly into his arms, if he would open them to receive her.
Now, though I shall not perhaps be able absolutely to acquit him of either of these charges (for want of prudence admits of no excuse; and what I shall produce against the latter charge will, I apprehend, be scarce satisfactory); yet, as evidence may sometimes be offered in mitigation, I shall set forth the plain matter of fact, and leave the whole to the reader's determination.
Mr Jones had somewhat about him, which, though I think writers are not thoroughly agreed in its name, doth certainly inhabit some human breasts; whose use is not so properly to distinguish right from wrong, as to prompt and incite them to the former, and to restrain and withhold them from the latter.
This somewhat may be indeed resembled to the famous trunk-maker in the playhouse; for, whenever the person who is possessed of it doth what is right, no ravished or friendly spectator is so eager or so loud in his applause: on the contrary, when he doth wrong, no critic is so apt to hiss and explode him.
To give a higher idea of the principle I mean, as well as one more familiar to the present age; it may be considered as sitting on its throne in the mind, like the Lord High Chancellor of this kingdom in his court; where it presides, governs, directs, judges, acquits, and condemns
140
according to merit and justice, with a knowledge which nothing escapes, a penetration which nothing can deceive, and an integrity which nothing can corrupt.
This active principle may perhaps be said to constitute the most essential barrier between us and our neighbours the brutes; for if there be some in the human shape who are not under any such dominion, I choose rather to consider them as deserters from us to our neighbours; among whom they will have the fate of deserters, and not be placed in the first rank.
Our heroe, whether he derived it from Thwackum or Square I will not determine, was very strongly under the guidance of this principle; for though he did not always act rightly, yet he never did otherwise without feeling and suffering for it. It was this which taught him, that to repay the civilities and little friendships of hospitality by robbing the house where you have received them, is to be the basest and meanest of thieves. He did not think the baseness of this offence lessened by the height of the injury committed; on the contrary, if to steal another's plate deserved death and infamy, it seemed to him difficult to assign a punishment adequate to the robbing a man of his whole fortune, and of his child into the bargain.
This principle, therefore, prevented him from any thought of making his fortune by such means (for this, as I have said, is an active principle, and doth not content itself with knowledge or belief only). Had he been greatly enamoured of Sophia, he possibly might have thought otherwise; but give me leave to say, there is great difference between running away with a man's daughter from the motive of love, and doing the same thing from the motive of theft.
Now, though this young gentleman was not insensible of the charms of Sophia; though he greatly liked her beauty, and esteemed all her other qualifications, she had made, however, no deep impression on his heart; for which, as it renders him liable to the charge of stupidity, or at least of want of taste, we shall now proceed to account.
The truth then is, his heart was in the possession of another woman. Here I question not but the reader will be surprized at our long taciturnity as to this matter; and quite at a loss to divine who this woman was, since we have hitherto not dropt a hint of any one likely to be a rival to Sophia; for as to Mrs Blifil, though we have been obliged to mention some suspicions of her affection for Tom, we have not hitherto given the least latitude for imagining that he had any for her; and, indeed, I am
141
sorry to say it, but the youth of both sexes are too apt to be deficient in their gratitude for that regard with which persons more advanced in years are sometimes so kind to honour them.
That the reader may be no longer in suspense, he will be pleased to remember, that we have often mentioned the family of George Seagrim (commonly called Black George, the gamekeeper), which consisted at present of a wife and five children.
The second of these children was a daughter, whose name was Molly, and who was esteemed one of the handsomest girls in the whole country.
Congreve well says there is in true beauty something which vulgar souls cannot admire; so can no dirt or rags hide this something from those souls which are not of the vulgar stamp.
The beauty of this girl made, however, no impression on Tom, till she grew towards the age of sixteen, when Tom, who was near three years older, began first to cast the eyes of affection upon her. And this affection he had fixed on the girl long before he could bring himself to attempt the possession of her person: for though his constitution urged him greatly to this, his principles no less forcibly restrained him. To debauch a young woman, however low her condition was, appeared to him a very heinous crime; and the good-will he bore the father, with the compassion he had for his family, very strongly corroborated all such sober reflections; so that he once resolved to get the better of his inclinations, and he actually abstained three whole months without ever going to Seagrim's house, or seeing his daughter.
Now, though Molly was, as we have said, generally thought a very fine girl, and in reality she was so, yet her beauty was not of the most amiable kind. It had, indeed, very little of feminine in it, and would have become a man at least as well as a woman; for, to say the truth, youth and florid health had a very considerable share in the composition.
Nor was her mind more effeminate than her person. As this was tall and robust, so was that bold and forward. So little had she of modesty, that Jones had more regard for her virtue than she herself. And as most probably she liked Tom as well as he liked her, so when she perceived his backwardness she herself grew proportionably forward; and when she saw he had entirely deserted the house, she found means of throwing herself in his way, and behaved in such a manner that the youth must have had very much or very little of the heroe if her endeavours had proved unsuccessful. In a word, she soon triumphed over all the
142
virtuous resolutions of Jones; for though she behaved at last with all decent reluctance, yet I rather chuse to attribute the triumph to her, since, in fact, it was her design which succeeded.
In the conduct of this matter, I say, Molly so well played her part, that Jones attributed the conquest entirely to himself, and considered the young woman as one who had yielded to the violent attacks of his passion. He likewise imputed her yielding to the ungovernable force of her love towards him; and this the reader will allow to have been a very natural and probable supposition, as we have more than once mentioned the uncommon comeliness of his person: and, indeed, he was one of the handsomest young fellows in the world.
As there are some minds whose affections, like Master Blifil's, are solely placed on one single person, whose interest and indulgence alone they consider on every occasion; regarding the good and ill of all others as merely indifferent, any farther than as they contribute to the pleasure or advantage of that person: so there is a different temper of mind which borrows a degree of virtue even from self-love. Such can never receive any kind of satisfaction from another, without loving the creature to whom that satisfaction is owing, and without making its well-being in some sort necessary to their own ease.
Of this latter species was our heroe. He considered this poor girl as one whose happiness or misery he had caused to be dependent on himself. Her beauty was still the object of desire, though greater beauty, or a fresher object, might have been more so; but the little abatement which fruition had occasioned to this was highly overbalanced by the considerations of the affection which she visibly bore him, and of the situation into which he had brought her. The former of these created gratitude, the latter compassion; and both, together with his desire for her person, raised in him a passion which might, without any great violence to the word, be called love; though, perhaps, it was at first not very judiciously placed.
This, then, was the true reason of that insensibility which he had shown to the charms of Sophia, and that behaviour in her which might have been reasonably enough interpreted as an encouragement to his addresses; for as he could not think of abandoning his Molly, poor and destitute as she was, so no more could he entertain a notion of betraying such a creature as Sophia. And surely, had he given the least encouragement to any passion for that young lady, he must have been absolutely guilty of one or other of those crimes; either of which would, in my
143
opinion, have very justly subjected him to that fate, which, at his first introduction into this history, I mentioned to have been generally predicted as his certain destiny.

Chapter /
Being the shortest chapter in this book.
Her mother first perceived the alteration in the shape of Molly; and in order to hide it from her neighbours, she foolishly clothed her in that sack which Sophia had sent her; though, indeed, that young lady had little apprehension that the poor woman would have been weak enough to let any of her daughters wear it in that form.
Molly was charmed with the first opportunity she ever had of showing her beauty to advantage; for though she could very well bear to contemplate herself in the glass, even when dressed in rags; and though she had in that dress conquered the heart of Jones, and perhaps of some others; yet she thought the addition of finery would much improve her charms, and extend her conquests.
Molly, therefore, having dressed herself out in this sack, with a new laced cap, and some other ornaments which Tom had given her, repairs to church with her fan in her hand the very next Sunday. The great are deceived if they imagine they have appropriated ambition and vanity to themselves. These noble qualities flourish as notably in a country church and churchyard as in the drawing-room, or in the closet. Schemes have indeed been laid in the vestry which would hardly disgrace the conclave. Here is a ministry, and here is an opposition. Here are plots and circumventions, parties and factions, equal to those which are to be found in courts.
Nor are the women here less practised in the highest feminine arts than their fair superiors in quality and fortune. Here are prudes and coquettes. Here are dressing and ogling, falsehood, envy, malice, scandal; in short, everything which is common to the most splendid assembly, or politest circle. Let those of high life, therefore, no longer despise the ignorance of their inferiors; nor the vulgar any longer rail at the vices of their betters.
145
Molly had seated herself some time before she was known by her neighbours. And then a whisper ran through the whole congregation, "Who is she?" but when she was discovered, such sneering, gigling, tittering, and laughing ensued among the women, that Mr Allworthy was obliged to exert his authority to preserve any decency among them.

Chapter V?
A battle sung by the muse in the Homerican style, and which none but the classical reader can taste.
Mr Western had an estate in this parish; and as his house stood at little greater distance from this church than from his own, he very often came to Divine Service here; and both he and the charming Sophia happened to be present at this time.
Sophia was much pleased with the beauty of the girl, whom she pitied for her simplicity in having dressed herself in that manner, as she saw the envy which it had occasioned among her equals. She no sooner came home than she sent for the gamekeeper, and ordered him to bring his daughter to her; saying she would provide for her in the family, and might possibly place the girl about her own person, when her own maid, who was now going away, had left her.
Poor Seagrim was thunderstruck at this; for he was no stranger to the fault in the shape of his daughter. He answered, in a stammering voice, "That he was afraid Molly would be too awkward to wait on her ladyship, as she had never been at service." "No matter for that," says Sophia; "she will soon improve. I am pleased with the girl, and am resolved to try her."
Black George now repaired to his wife, on whose prudent counsel he depended to extricate him out of this dilemma; but when he came thither he found his house in some confusion. So great envy had this sack occasioned, that when Mr Allworthy and the other gentry were gone from church, the rage, which had hitherto been confined, burst into an uproar; and, having vented itself at first in opprobrious words, laughs, hisses, and gestures, betook itself at last to certain missile weapons; which, though from their plastic nature they threatened neither the loss of life or of limb, were however sufficiently dreadful to a well-dressed lady. Molly had too much spirit to bear this treatment tamely. Having therefore一but
147
hold, as we are diffident of our own abilities, let us here invite a superior power to our assistance.
Ye Muses, then, whoever ye are, who love to sing battles, and principally thou who whilom didst recount the slaughter in those fields where Hudibras and Trulla fought, if thou wert not starved with thy friend Butler, assist me on this great occasion. All things are not in the power of all.
As a vast herd of cows in a rich farmer's yard, if, while they are milked, they hear their calves at a distance, lamenting the robbery which is then committing, roar and bellow; so roared forth the Somersetshire mob an hallaloo, made up of almost as many squalls, screams, and other different sounds as there were persons, or indeed passions among them: some were inspired by rage, others alarmed by fear, and others had nothing in their heads but the love of fun; but chiefly Envy, the sister of Satan, and his constant companion, rushed among the crowd, and blew up the fury of the women; who no sooner came up to Molly than they pelted her with dirt and rubbish.
Molly, having endeavoured in vain to make a handsome retreat, faced about; and laying hold of ragged Bess, who advanced in the front of the enemy, she at one blow felled her to the ground. The whole army of the enemy (though near a hundred in number), seeing the fate of their general, gave back many paces, and retired behind a new-dug grave; for the churchyard was the field of battle, where there was to be a funeral that very evening. Molly pursued her victory, and catching up a skull which lay on the side of the grave, discharged it with such fury, that having hit a taylor on the head, the two skulls sent equally forth a hollow sound at their meeting, and the taylor took presently measure of his length on the ground, where the skulls lay side by side, and it was doubtful which was the more valuable of the two. Molly then taking a thigh-bone in her hand, fell in among the flying ranks, and dealing her blows with great liberality on either side, overthrew the carcass of many a mighty heroe and heroine.
Recount, O Muse, the names of those who fell on this fatal day. First, Jemmy Tweedle felt on his hinder head the direful bone. Him the pleasant banks of sweetly-winding Stour had nourished, where he first learnt the vocal art, with which, wandering up and down at wakes and fairs, he cheered the rural nymphs and swains, when upon the green they interweaved the sprightly dance; while he himself stood fiddling and jumping to his own music. How little now avails his fiddle! He thumps the verdant floor with his carcass. Next, old Echepole, the sowgelder,
148
received a blow in his forehead from our Amazonian heroine, and immediately fell to the ground. He was a swinging fat fellow, and fell with almost as much noise as a house. His tobacco-box dropped at the same time from his pocket, which Molly took up as lawful spoils. Then Kate of the Mill tumbled unfortunately over a tombstone, which catching hold of her ungartered stocking inverted the order of nature, and gave her heels the superiority to her head. Betty Pippin, with young Roger her lover, fell both to the ground; where, oh perverse fate! she salutes the earth, and he the sky. Tom Freckle, the smith's son, was the next victim to her rage. He was an ingenious workman, and made excellent pattens; nay, the very patten with which he was knocked down was his own workmanship. Had he been at that time singing psalms in the church, he would have avoided a broken head. Miss Crow, the daughter of a farmer; John Giddish, himself a farmer; Nan Slouch, Esther Codling, Will Spray, Tom Bennet; the three Misses Potter, whose father keeps the sign of the Red Lion; Betty Chambermaid, Jack Ostler, and many others of inferior note, lay rolling among the graves.
Not that the strenuous arm of Molly reached all these; for many of them in their flight overthrew each other.
But now Fortune, fearing she had acted out of character, and had inclined too long to the same side, especially as it was the right side, hastily turned about: for now Goody Brown一whom Zekiel Brown caressed in his arms; nor he alone, but half the parish besides; so famous was she in the fields of Venus, nor indeed less in those of Mars. The trophies of both these her husband always bore about on his head and face; for if ever human head did by its horns display the amorous glories of a wife, Zekiel's did; nor did his well-scratched face less denote her talents (or rather talons) of a different kind.
No longer bore this Amazon the shameful flight of her party. She stopt short, and, calling aloud to all who fled, spoke as follows: "Ye Somersetshire men, or rather ye Somersetshire women, are ye not ashamed thus to fly from a single woman? But if no other will oppose her, I myself and Joan Top here will have the honour of the victory." Having thus said, she flew at Molly Seagrim, and easily wrenched the thigh-bone from her hand, at the same time clawing off her cap from her head. Then laying hold of the hair of Molly with her left hand, she attacked her so furiously in the face with the right, that the blood soon began to trickle from her nose. Molly was not idle this while. She soon removed the clout from the head of Goody Brown, and then fastening on her hair with one hand,
149
with the other she caused another bloody stream to issue forth from the nostrils of the enemy.
When each of the combatants had borne off sufficient spoils of hair from the head of her antagonist, the next rage was against the garments. In this attack they exerted so much violence, that in a very few minutes they were both naked to the middle.
It is lucky for the women that the seat of fistycuff war is not the same with them as among men; but though they may seem a little to deviate from their sex, when they go forth to battle, yet I have observed, they never so far forget, as to assail the bosoms of each other; where a few blows would be fatal to most of them. This, I know, some derive from their being of a more bloody inclination than the males. On which account they apply to the nose, as to the part whence blood may most easily be drawn; but this seems a far-fetched as well as ill-natured supposition.
Goody Brown had great advantage of Molly in this particular; for the former had indeed no breasts, her bosom (if it may be so called), as well in colour as in many other properties, exactly resembling an antient piece of parchment, upon which any one might have drummed a considerable while without doing her any great damage.
Molly, beside her present unhappy condition, was differently formed in those parts, and might, perhaps, have tempted the envy of Brown to give her a fatal blow, had not the lucky arrival of Tom Jones at this instant put an immediate end to the bloody scene.
This accident was luckily owing to Mr Square; for he, Master Blifil, and Jones, had mounted their horses, after church, to take the air, and had ridden about a quarter of a mile, when Square, changing his mind (not idly, but for a reason which we shall unfold as soon as we have leisure), desired the young gentlemen to ride with him another way than they had at first purposed. This motion being complied with, brought them of necessity back again to the churchyard.
Master Blifil, who rode first, seeing such a mob assembled, and two women in the posture in which we left the combatants, stopt his horse to enquire what was the matter. A country fellow, scratching his head, answered him: "I don't know, measter, un't I; an't please your honour, here hath been a vight, I think, between Goody Brown and Moll Seagrim."
"Who, who?" cries Tom; but without waiting for an answer, having discovered the features of his Molly through all the discomposure in
150
which they now were, he hastily alighted, turned his horse loose, and, leaping over the wall, ran to her. She now first bursting into tears, told him how barbarously she had been treated. Upon which, forgetting the sex of Goody Brown, or perhaps not knowing it in his rage一for, in reality, she had no feminine appearance but a petticoat, which he might not observe一he gave her a lash or two with his horsewhip; and then flying at the mob, who were all accused by Moll, he dealt his blows so profusely on all sides, that unless I would again invoke the muse (which the good-natured reader may think a little too hard upon her, as she hath so lately been violently sweated), it would be impossible for me to recount the horse-whipping of that day.
Having scoured the whole coast of the enemy, as well as any of Homer's heroes ever did, or as Don Quixote or any knight-errant in the world could have done, he returned to Molly, whom he found in a condition which must give both me and my reader pain, was it to be described here. Tom raved like a madman, beat his breast, tore his hair, stamped on the ground, and vowed the utmost vengeance on all who had been concerned. He then pulled off his coat, and buttoned it round her, put his hat upon her head, wiped the blood from her face as well as he could with his handkerchief, and called out to the servant to ride as fast as possible for a side-saddle, or a pillion, that he might carry her safe home.
Master Blifil objected to the sending away the servant, as they had only one with them; but as Square seconded the order of Jones, he was obliged to comply.
The servant returned in a very short time with the pillion, and Molly, having collected her rags as well as she could, was placed behind him. In which manner she was carried home, Square, Blifil, and Jones attending.
Here Jones having received his coat, given her a sly kiss, and whispered her, that he would return in the evening, quitted his Molly, and rode on after his companions.

Chapter J
Containing matter of no very peaceable colour.
Molly had no sooner apparelled herself in her accustomed rags, than her sisters began to fall violently upon her, particularly her eldest sister, who told her she was well enough served. "How had she the assurance to wear a gown which young Madam Western had given to mother! If one of us was to wear it, I think," says she, "I myself have the best right; but I warrant you think it belongs to your beauty. I suppose you think yourself more handsomer than any of us."一"Hand her down the bit of glass from over the cupboard," cries another; "I'd wash the blood from my face before I talked of my beauty."一"You'd better have minded what the parson says," cries the eldest, "and not a harkened after men voke."一"Indeed, child, and so she had," says the mother, sobbing: "she hath brought a disgrace upon us all. She's the vurst of the vamily that ever was a whore."
"You need not upbraid me with that, mother," cries Molly; "you yourself was brought-to-bed of sister there, within a week after you was married."
"Yes, hussy," answered the enraged mother, "so I was, and what was the mighty matter of that? I was made an honest woman then; and if you was to be made an honest woman, I should not be angry; but you must have to doing with a gentleman, you nasty slut; you will have a bastard, hussy, you will; and that I defy any one to say of me."
In this situation Black George found his family, when he came home for the purpose before mentioned. As his wife and three daughters were all of them talking together, and most of them crying, it was some time before he could get an opportunity of being heard; but as soon as such an interval occurred, he acquainted the company with what Sophia had said to him.
152
Goody Seagrim then began to revile her daughter afresh. "Here," says she, "you have brought us into a fine quandary indeed. What will madam say to that big belly? Oh that ever I should live to see this day!"
Molly answered with great spirit, "And what is this mighty place which you have got for me, father?" (for he had not well understood the phrase used by Sophia of being about her person). "I suppose it is to be under the cook; but I shan't wash dishes for anybody. My gentleman will provide better for me. See what he hath given me this afternoon. He hath promised I shall never want money; and you shan't want money neither, mother, if you will hold your tongue, and know when you are well." And so saying, she pulled out several guineas, and gave her mother one of them.
The good woman no sooner felt the gold within her palm, than her temper began (such is the efficacy of that panacea) to be mollified. "Why, husband," says she, "would any but such a blockhead as you not have enquired what place this was before he had accepted it? Perhaps, as Molly says, it may be in the kitchen; and truly I don't care my daughter should be a scullion wench; for, poor as I am, I am a gentlewoman. And thof I was obliged, as my father, who was a clergyman, died worse than nothing, and so could not give me a shilling of potion, to undervalue myself by marrying a poor man; yet I would have you to know, I have a spirit above all them things. Marry come up! it would better become Madam Western to look at home, and remember who her own grandfather was. Some of my family, for aught I know, might ride in their coaches, when the grandfathers of some voke walked a-voot. I warrant she fancies she did a mighty matter, when she sent us that old gownd; some of my family would not have picked up such rags in the street; but poor people are always trampled upon.一The parish need not have been in such a fluster with Molly. You might have told them, child, your grandmother wore better things new out of the shop."
"Well, but consider," cried George, "what answer shall I make to madam?"
"I don't know what answer," says she; "you are always bringing your family into one quandary or other. Do you remember when you shot the partridge, the occasion of all our misfortunes? Did not I advise you never to go into Squire Western's manor? Did not I tell you many a good year ago what would come of it? But you would have your own headstrong ways; yes, you would, you villain."
153
Black George was, in the main, a peaceable kind of fellow, and nothing choleric nor rash; yet did he bear about him something of what the antients called the irascible, and which his wife, if she had been endowed with much wisdom, would have feared. He had long experienced, that when the storm grew very high, arguments were but wind, which served rather to increase, than to abate it. He was therefore seldom unprovided with a small switch, a remedy of wonderful force, as he had often essayed, and which the word villain served as a hint for his applying.
No sooner, therefore, had this symptom appeared, than he had immediate recourse to the said remedy, which though, as it is usual in all very efficacious medicines, it at first seemed to heighten and inflame the disease, soon produced a total calm, and restored the patient to perfect ease and tranquillity.
This is, however, a kind of horse-medicine, which requires a very robust constitution to digest, and is therefore proper only for the vulgar, unless in one single instance, viz., where superiority of birth breaks out; in which case, we should not think it very improperly applied by any husband whatever, if the application was not in itself so base, that, like certain applications of the physical kind which need not be mentioned, it so much degrades and contaminates the hand employed in it, that no gentleman should endure the thought of anything so low and detestable.
The whole family were soon reduced to a state of perfect quiet; for the virtue of this medicine, like that of electricity, is often communicated through one person to many others, who are not touched by the instrument. To say the truth, as they both operate by friction, it may be doubted whether there is not something analogous between them, of which Mr Freke would do well to enquire, before he publishes the next edition of his book.
A council was now called, in which, after many debates, Molly still persisting that she would not go to service, it was at length resolved, that Goody Seagrim herself should wait on Miss Western, and endeavour to procure the place for her eldest daughter, who declared great readiness to accept it: but Fortune, who seems to have been an enemy of this little family, afterwards put a stop to her promotion.

Chapter A Vx
A story told by Mr Supple, the curate. The penetration of Squire Western. His great love for his daughter, and the return to it made by her.
The next morning Tom Jones hunted with Mr Western, and was at his return invited by that gentleman to dinner.
The lovely Sophia shone forth that day with more gaiety and sprightliness than usual. Her battery was certainly levelled at our heroe; though, I believe, she herself scarce yet knew her own intention; but if she had any design of charming him, she now succeeded.
Mr Supple, the curate of Mr Allworthy's parish, made one of the company. He was a good-natured worthy man; but chiefly remarkable for his great taciturnity at table, though his mouth was never shut at it. In short, he had one of the best appetites in the world. However, the cloth was no sooner taken away, than he always made sufficient amends for his silence: for he was a very hearty fellow; and his conversation was often entertaining, never offensive.
At his first arrival, which was immediately before the entrance of the roast-beef, he had given an intimation that he had brought some news with him, and was beginning to tell, that he came that moment from Mr Allworthy's, when the sight of the roast-beef struck him dumb, permitting him only to say grace, and to declare he must pay his respect to the baronet, for so he called the sirloin.
When dinner was over, being reminded by Sophia of his news, he began as follows: "I believe, lady, your ladyship observed a young woman at church yesterday at even-song, who was drest in one of your outlandish garments; I think I have seen your ladyship in such a one. However, in the country, such dresses are
Rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima cygno.
That is, madam, as much as to say, 'A rare bird upon the earth, and very like a black swan.' The verse is in Juvenal. But to return to what I
155
was relating. I was saying such garments are rare sights in the country; and perchance, too, it was thought the more rare, respect being had to the person who wore it, who, they tell me, is the daughter of Black George, your worship's gamekeeper, whose sufferings, I should have opined, might have taught him more wit, than to dress forth his wenches in such gaudy apparel. She created so much confusion in the congregation, that if Squire Allworthy had not silenced it, it would have interrupted the service: for I was once about to stop in the middle of the first lesson. Howbeit, nevertheless, after prayer was over, and I was departed home, this occasioned a battle in the churchyard, where, amongst other mischief, the head of a travelling fidler was very much broken. This morning the fidler came to Squire Allworthy for a warrant, and the wench was brought before him. The squire was inclined to have compounded matters; when, lo! on a sudden the wench appeared (I ask your ladyship's pardon) to be, as it were, at the eve of bringing forth a bastard. The squire demanded of her who was the father? But she pertinaciously refused to make any response. So that he was about to make her mittimus to Bridewell when I departed."
"And is a wench having a bastard all your news, doctor?" cries Western; "I thought it might have been some public matter, something about the nation."
"I am afraid it is too common, indeed," answered the parson; "but I thought the whole story altogether deserved commemorating. As to national matters, your worship knows them best. My concerns extend no farther than my own parish."
"Why, ay," says the squire, "I believe I do know a little of that matter, as you say. But, come, Tommy, drink about; the bottle stands with you."
Tom begged to be excused, for that he had particular business; and getting up from table, escaped the clutches of the squire, who was rising to stop him, and went off with very little ceremony.
The squire gave him a good curse at his departure; and then turning to the parson, he cried out, "I smoke it: I smoke it. Tom is certainly the father of this bastard. Zooks, parson, you remember how he recommended the veather o' her to me. D一n un, what a sly b一ch 'tis. Ay, ay, as sure as two-pence, Tom is the veather of the bastard."
"I should be very sorry for that," says the parson.
"Why sorry," cries the squire: "Where is the mighty matter o't? What, I suppose dost pretend that thee hast never got a bastard? Pox! more good
156
luck's thine? for I warrant hast a done a therefore many's the good time and often."
"Your worship is pleased to be jocular," answered the parson; "but I do not only animadvert on the sinfulness of the action一though that surely is to be greatly deprecated一but I fear his unrighteousness may injure him with Mr Allworthy. And truly I must say, though he hath the character of being a little wild, I never saw any harm in the young man; nor can I say I have heard any, save what your worship now mentions. I wish, indeed, he was a little more regular in his responses at church; but altogether he seems
Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris.
That is a classical line, young lady; and, being rendered into English, is, 'a lad of an ingenuous countenance, and of an ingenuous modesty;' for this was a virtue in great repute both among the Latins and Greeks. I must say, the young gentleman (for so I think I may call him, notwithstanding his birth) appears to me a very modest, civil lad, and I should be sorry that he should do himself any injury in Squire Allworthy's opinion."
"Poogh!" says the squire: "Injury, with Allworthy! Why, Allworthy loves a wench himself. Doth not all the country know whose son Tom is? You must talk to another person in that manner. I remember Allworthy at college."
"I thought," said the parson, "he had never been at the university."
"Yes, yes, he was," says the squire: "and many a wench have we two had together. As arrant a whore-master as any within five miles o'un. No, no. It will do'n no harm with he, assure yourself; nor with anybody else. Ask Sophy there一You have not the worse opinion of a young fellow for getting a bastard, have you, girl? No, no, the women will like un the better for't."
This was a cruel question to poor Sophia. She had observed Tom's colour change at the parson's story; and that, with his hasty and abrupt departure, gave her sufficient reason to think her father's suspicion not groundless. Her heart now at once discovered the great secret to her which it had been so long disclosing by little and little; and she found herself highly interested in this matter. In such a situation, her father's malapert question rushing suddenly upon her, produced some symptoms which might have alarmed a suspicious heart; but, to do the squire justice, that was not his fault. When she rose therefore from her chair, and told him a hint from him was always sufficient to make her
157
withdraw, he suffered her to leave the room, and then with great gravity of countenance remarked, "That it was better to see a daughter overmodest than over-forward;"—a sentiment which was highly applauded by the parson.
There now ensued between the squire and the parson a most excellent political discourse, framed out of newspapers and political pamphlets; in which they made a libation of four bottles of wine to the good of their country: and then, the squire being fast asleep, the parson lighted his pipe, mounted his horse, and rode home.
When the squire had finished his half-hour's nap, he summoned his daughter to her harpsichord; but she begged to be excused that evening, on account of a violent head-ache. This remission was presently granted; for indeed she seldom had occasion to ask him twice, as he loved her with such ardent affection, that, by gratifying her, he commonly conveyed the highest gratification to himself. She was really, what he frequently called her, his little darling, and she well deserved to be so; for she returned all his affection in the most ample manner. She had preserved the most inviolable duty to him in all things; and this her love made not only easy, but so delightful, that when one of her companions laughed at her for placing so much merit in such scrupulous obedience, as that young lady called it, Sophia answered, "You mistake me, madam, if you think I value myself upon this account; for besides that I am barely discharging my duty, I am likewise pleasing myself. I can truly say I have no delight equal to that of contributing to my father's happiness; and if I value myself, my dear, it is on having this power, and not on executing it."
This was a satisfaction, however, which poor Sophia was incapable of tasting this evening. She therefore not only desired to be excused from her attendance at the harpsichord, but likewise begged that he would suffer her to absent herself from supper. To this request likewise the squire agreed, though not without some reluctance; for he scarce ever permitted her to be out of his sight, unless when he was engaged with his horses, dogs, or bottle. Nevertheless he yielded to the desire of his daughter, though the poor man was at the same time obliged to avoid his own company (if I may so express myself), by sending for a neighbouring farmer to sit with him.
158
The narrow escape of Molly Seagrim, with some observations for which we have been forced to dive pretty deep into nature.
Tom Jones had ridden one of Mr Western's horses that morning in the chase; so that having no horse of his own in the squire's stable, he was obliged to go home on foot: this he did so expeditiously that he ran upwards of three miles within the half-hour.
Just as he arrived at Mr Allworthy's outward gate, he met the constable and company with Molly in their possession, whom they were conducting to that house where the inferior sort of people may learn one good lesson, viz., respect and deference to their superiors; since it must show them the wide distinction Fortune intends between those persons who are to be corrected for their faults, and those who are not; which lesson if they do not learn, I am afraid they very rarely learn any other good lesson, or improve their morals, at the house of correction.
A lawyer may perhaps think Mr Allworthy exceeded his authority a little in this instance. And, to say the truth, I question, as here was no regular information before him, whether his conduct was strictly regular. However, as his intention was truly upright, he ought to be excused in foro conscientiae; since so many arbitrary acts are daily committed by magistrates who have not this excuse to plead for themselves.
Tom was no sooner informed by the constable whither they were proceeding (indeed he pretty well guessed it of himself), than he caught Molly in his arms, and embracing her tenderly before them all, swore he would murder the first man who offered to lay hold of her. He bid her dry her eyes and be comforted; for, wherever she went, he would accompany her. Then turning to the constable, who stood trembling with his hat off, he desired him, in a very mild voice, to return with him for a moment only to his father (for so he now called Allworthy); for he durst, he said, be assured, that, when he had alledged what he had to say in her favour, the girl would be discharged.
159
The constable, who, I make no doubt, would have surrendered his prisoner had Tom demanded her, very readily consented to this request. So back they all went into Mr Allworthy's hall; where Tom desired them to stay till his return, and then went himself in pursuit of the good man. As soon as he was found, Tom threw himself at his feet, and having begged a patient hearing, confessed himself to be the father of the child of which Molly was then big. He entreated him to have compassion on the poor girl, and to consider, if there was any guilt in the case, it lay principally at his door.
"If there is any guilt in the case!" answered Allworthy warmly: "Are you then so profligate and abandoned a libertine to doubt whether the breaking the laws of God and man, the corrupting and ruining a poor girl be guilt? I own, indeed, it doth lie principally upon you; and so heavy it is, that you ought to expect it should crush you."
"Whatever may be my fate," says Tom, "let me succeed in my intercessions for the poor girl. I confess I have corrupted her! but whether she shall be ruined, depends on you. For Heaven's sake, sir, revoke your warrant, and do not send her to a place which must unavoidably prove her destruction."
Allworthy bid him immediately call a servant. Tom answered there was no occasion; for he had luckily met them at the gate, and relying upon his goodness, had brought them all back into his hall, where they now waited his final resolution, which upon his knees he besought him might be in favour of the girl; that she might be permitted to go home to her parents, and not be exposed to a greater degree of shame and scorn than must necessarily fall upon her. "I know," said he, "that is too much. I know I am the wicked occasion of it. I will endeavour to make amends, if possible; and if you shall have hereafter the goodness to forgive me, I hope I shall deserve it."
Allworthy hesitated some time, and at last said, "Well, I will discharge my mittimus.一You may send the constable to me." He was instantly called, discharged, and so was the girl.
It will be believed that Mr Allworthy failed not to read Tom a very severe lecture on this occasion; but it is unnecessary to insert it here, as we have faithfully transcribed what he said to Jenny Jones in the first book, most of which may be applied to the men, equally with the women. So sensible an effect had these reproofs on the young man, who was no hardened sinner, that he retired to his own room, where he passed the evening alone, in much melancholy contemplation.
160
Allworthy was sufficiently offended by this transgression of Jones; for notwithstanding the assertions of Mr Western, it is certain this worthy man had never indulged himself in any loose pleasures with women, and greatly condemned the vice of incontinence in others. Indeed, there is much reason to imagine that there was not the least truth in what Mr Western affirmed, especially as he laid the scene of those impurities at the university, where Mr Allworthy had never been. In fact, the good squire was a little too apt to indulge that kind of pleasantry which is generally called rhodomontade: but which may, with as much propriety, be expressed by a much shorter word; and perhaps we too often supply the use of this little monosyllable by others; since very much of what frequently passes in the world for wit and humour, should, in the strictest purity of language, receive that short appellation, which, in conformity to the well-bred laws of custom, I here suppress.
But whatever detestation Mr Allworthy had to this or to any other vice, he was not so blinded by it but that he could discern any virtue in the guilty person, as clearly indeed as if there had been no mixture of vice in the same character. While he was angry therefore with the incontinence of Jones, he was no less pleased with the honour and honesty of his self-accusation. He began now to form in his mind the same opinion of this young fellow, which, we hope, our reader may have conceived. And in balancing his faults with his perfections, the latter seemed rather to preponderate.
It was to no purpose, therefore, that Thwackum, who was immediately charged by Mr Blifil with the story, unbended all his rancour against poor Tom. Allworthy gave a patient hearing to their invectives, and then answered coldly: "That young men of Tom's complexion were too generally addicted to this vice; but he believed that youth was sincerely affected with what he had said to him on the occasion, and he hoped he would not transgress again." So that, as the days of whipping were at an end, the tutor had no other vent but his own mouth for his gall, the usual poor resource of impotent revenge.
But Square, who was a less violent, was a much more artful man; and as he hated Jones more perhaps than Thwackum himself did, so he contrived to do him more mischief in the mind of Mr Allworthy.
The reader must remember the several little incidents of the partridge, the horse, and the Bible, which were recounted in the second book. By all which Jones had rather improved than injured the affection which Mr Allworthy was inclined to entertain for him. The same, I believe, must
161
have happened to him with every other person who hath any idea of friendship, generosity, and greatness of spirit, that is to say, who hath any traces of goodness in his mind.
Square himself was not unacquainted with the true impression which those several instances of goodness had made on the excellent heart of Allworthy; for the philosopher very well knew what virtue was, though he was not always perhaps steady in its pursuit; but as for Thwackum, from what reason I will not determine, no such thoughts ever entered into his head: he saw Jones in a bad light, and he imagined Allworthy saw him in the same, but that he was resolved, from pride and stubbornness of spirit, not to give up the boy whom he had once cherished; since by so doing, he must tacitly acknowledge that his former opinion of him had been wrong.
Square therefore embraced this opportunity of injuring Jones in the tenderest part, by giving a very bad turn to all these before-mentioned occurrences. "I am sorry, sir," said he, "to own I have been deceived as well as yourself. I could not, I confess, help being pleased with what I ascribed to the motive of friendship, though it was carried to an excess, and all excess is faulty and vicious: but in this I made allowance for youth. Little did I suspect that the sacrifice of truth, which we both imagined to have been made to friendship, was in reality a prostitution of it to a depraved and debauched appetite. You now plainly see whence all the seeming generosity of this young man to the family of the gamekeeper proceeded. He supported the father in order to corrupt the daughter, and preserved the family from starving, to bring one of them to shame and ruin. This is friendship! this is generosity! As Sir Richard Steele says, 'Gluttons who give high prices for delicacies, are very worthy to be called generous.' In short I am resolved, from this instance, never to give way to the weakness of human nature more, nor to think anything virtue which doth not exactly quadrate with the unerring rule of right."
The goodness of Allworthy had prevented those considerations from occurring to himself; yet were they too plausible to be absolutely and hastily rejected, when laid before his eyes by another. Indeed what Square had said sunk very deeply into his mind, and the uneasiness which it there created was very visible to the other; though the good man would not acknowledge this, but made a very slight answer, and forcibly drove off the discourse to some other subject. It was well perhaps for poor Tom, that no such suggestions had been made before he was pardoned; for they certainly stamped in the mind of Allworthy the first bad impression concerning Jones.

Containing much clearer matters; but which flowed from the same fountain with those in the preceding chapter.
The reader will be pleased, I believe, to return with me to Sophia. She passed the night, after we saw her last, in no very agreeable manner. Sleep befriended her but little, and dreams less. In the morning, when Mrs Honour, her maid, attended her at the usual hour, she was found already up and drest.
Persons who live two or three miles' distance in the country are considered as next-door neighbours, and transactions at the one house fly with incredible celerity to the other. Mrs Honour, therefore, had heard the whole story of Molly's shame; which she, being of a very communicative temper, had no sooner entered the apartment of her mistress, than she began to relate in the following manner:一
"La, ma'am, what doth your la'ship think? the girl that your la'ship saw at church on Sunday, whom you thought so handsome; though you would not have thought her so handsome neither, if you had seen her nearer, but to be sure she hath been carried before the justice for being big with child. She seemed to me to look like a confident slut: and to be sure she hath laid the child to young Mr Jones. And all the parish says Mr Allworthy is so angry with young Mr Jones, that he won't see him. To be sure, one can't help pitying the poor young man, and yet he doth not deserve much pity neither, for demeaning himself with such kind of trumpery. Yet he is so pretty a gentleman, I should be sorry to have him turned out of doors. I dares to swear the wench was as willing as he; for she was always a forward kind of body. And when wenches are so coming, young men are not so much to be blamed neither; for to be sure they do no more than what is natural. Indeed it is beneath them to meddle with such dirty draggle-tails; and whatever happens to them, it is good enough for them. And yet, to be sure, the vile baggages are most in fault. I wishes, with all my heart, they were well to be whipped at the cart's tail; for it is pity they should be the ruin of a pretty young gentleman;
163
and nobody can deny but that Mr Jones is one of the most handsomest young men that ever-----"
She was running on thus, when Sophia, with a more peevish voice than she had ever spoken to her in before, cried, "Prithee, why dost thou trouble me with all this stuff? What concern have I in what Mr Jones doth? I suppose you are all alike. And you seem to me to be angry it was not your own case."
"I, ma'am!" answered Mrs Honour, "I am sorry your ladyship should have such an opinion of me. I am sure nobody can say any such thing of me. All the young fellows in the world may go to the divil for me. Because I said he was a handsome man? Everybody says it as well as I. To be sure, I never thought as it was any harm to say a young man was handsome; but to be sure I shall never think him so any more now; for handsome is that handsome does. A beggar wench!一"
"Stop thy torrent of impertinence," cries Sophia, "and see whether my father wants me at breakfast."
Mrs Honour then flung out of the room, muttering much to herself, of which "Marry come up, I assure you," was all that could be plainly distinguished.
Whether Mrs Honour really deserved that suspicion, of which her mistress gave her a hint, is a matter which we cannot indulge our reader's curiosity by resolving. We will, however, make him amends in disclosing what passed in the mind of Sophia.
The reader will be pleased to recollect, that a secret affection for Mr Jones had insensibly stolen into the bosom of this young lady. That it had there grown to a pretty great height before she herself had discovered it. When she first began to perceive its symptoms, the sensations were so sweet and pleasing, that she had not resolution sufficient to check or repel them; and thus she went on cherishing a passion of which she never once considered the consequences.
This incident relating to Molly first opened her eyes. She now first perceived the weakness of which she had been guilty; and though it caused the utmost perturbation in her mind, yet it had the effect of other nauseous physic, and for the time expelled her distemper. Its operation indeed was most wonderfully quick; and in the short interval, while her maid was absent, so entirely removed all symptoms, that when Mrs Honour returned with a summons from her father, she was become perfectly easy, and had brought herself to a thorough indifference for Mr Jones.
164
The diseases of the mind do in almost every particular imitate those of the body. For which reason, we hope, that learned faculty, for whom we have so profound a respect, will pardon us the violent hands we have been necessitated to lay on several words and phrases, which of right belong to them, and without which our descriptions must have been often unintelligible.
Now there is no one circumstance in which the distempers of the mind bear a more exact analogy to those which are called bodily, than that aptness which both have to a relapse. This is plain in the violent diseases of ambition and avarice. I have known ambition, when cured at court by frequent disappointments (which are the only physic for it), to break out again in a contest for foreman of the grand jury at an assizes; and have heard of a man who had so far conquered avarice, as to give away many a sixpence, that comforted himself, at last, on his deathbed, by making a crafty and advantageous bargain concerning his ensuing funeral, with an undertaker who had married his only child.
In the affair of love, which, out of strict conformity with the Stoic philosophy, we shall here treat as a disease, this proneness to relapse is no less conspicuous. Thus it happened to poor Sophia; upon whom, the very next time she saw young Jones, all the former symptoms returned, and from that time cold and hot fits alternately seized her heart.
The situation of this young lady was now very different from what it had ever been before. That passion which had formerly been so exquisitely delicious, became now a scorpion in her bosom. She resisted it therefore with her utmost force, and summoned every argument her reason (which was surprisingly strong for her age) could suggest, to subdue and expel it. In this she so far succeeded, that she began to hope from time and absence a perfect cure. She resolved therefore to avoid Tom Jones as much as possible; for which purpose she began to conceive a design of visiting her aunt, to which she made no doubt of obtaining her father's consent.
But Fortune, who had other designs in her head, put an immediate stop to any such proceeding, by introducing an accident, which will be related in the next chapter.
165
13
Chapter 且 U
A dreadful accident which befel Sophia. The gallant behaviour of Jones, and the more dreadful consequence of that behaviour to the young lady; with a short digression in favour of the female sex.
Mr Western grew every day fonder and fonder of Sophia, insomuch that his beloved dogs themselves almost gave place to her in his affections; but as he could not prevail on himself to abandon these, he contrived very cunningly to enjoy their company, together with that of his daughter, by insisting on her riding a hunting with him.
Sophia, to whom her father's word was a law, readily complied with his desires, though she had not the least delight in a sport, which was of too rough and masculine a nature to suit with her disposition. She had however another motive, beside her obedience, to accompany the old gentleman in the chase; for by her presence she hoped in some measure to restrain his impetuosity, and to prevent him from so frequently exposing his neck to the utmost hazard.
The strongest objection was that which would have formerly been an inducement to her, namely, the frequent meeting with young Jones, whom she had determined to avoid; but as the end of the hunting season now approached, she hoped, by a short absence with her aunt, to reason herself entirely out of her unfortunate passion; and had not any doubt of being able to meet him in the field the subsequent season without the least danger.
On the second day of her hunting, as she was returning from the chase, and was arrived within a little distance from Mr Western's house, her horse, whose mettlesome spirit required a better rider, fell suddenly to prancing and capering in such a manner that she was in the most imminent peril of falling. Tom Jones, who was at a little distance behind, saw this, and immediately galloped up to her assistance. As soon as he came up, he leapt from his own horse, and caught hold of hers by the bridle. The unruly beast presently reared himself an end on his hind legs,
166
and threw his lovely burthen from his back, and Jones caught her in his arms.
She was so affected with the fright, that she was not immediately able to satisfy Jones, who was very sollicitous to know whether she had received any hurt. She soon after, however, recovered her spirits, assured him she was safe, and thanked him for the care he had taken of her. Jones answered, "If I have preserved you, madam, I am sufficiently repaid; for I promise you, I would have secured you from the least harm at the expense of a much greater misfortune to myself than I have suffered on this occasion."
"What misfortune?" replied Sophia eagerly; "I hope you have come to no mischief?"
"Be not concerned, madam," answered Jones. "Heaven be praised you have escaped so well, considering the danger you was in. If I have broke my arm, I consider it as a trifle, in comparison of what I feared upon your account."
Sophia then screamed out, "Broke your arm! Heaven forbid."
"I am afraid I have, madam," says Jones: "but I beg you will suffer me first to take care of you. I have a right hand yet at your service, to help you into the next field, whence we have but a very little walk to your father's house."
Sophia seeing his left arm dangling by his side, while he was using the other to lead her, no longer doubted of the truth. She now grew much paler than her fears for herself had made her before. All her limbs were seized with a trembling, insomuch that Jones could scarce support her; and as her thoughts were in no less agitation, she could not refrain from giving Jones a look so full of tenderness, that it almost argued a stronger sensation in her mind, than even gratitude and pity united can raise in the gentlest female bosom, without the assistance of a third more powerful passion.
Mr Western, who was advanced at some distance when this accident happened, was now returned, as were the rest of the horsemen. Sophia immediately acquainted them with what had befallen Jones, and begged them to take care of him. Upon which Western, who had been much alarmed by meeting his daughter's horse without its rider, and was now overjoyed to find her unhurt, cried out, "I am glad it is no worse. If Tom hath broken his arm, we will get a joiner to mend un again."
167
The squire alighted from his horse, and proceeded to his house on foot, with his daughter and Jones. An impartial spectator, who had met them on the way, would, on viewing their several countenances, have concluded Sophia alone to have been the object of compassion: for as to Jones, he exulted in having probably saved the life of the young lady, at the price only of a broken bone; and Mr Western, though he was not unconcerned at the accident which had befallen Jones, was, however, delighted in a much higher degree with the fortunate escape of his daughter.
The generosity of Sophia's temper construed this behaviour of Jones into great bravery; and it made a deep impression on her heart: for certain it is, that there is no one quality which so generally recommends men to women as this; proceeding, if we believe the common opinion, from that natural timidity of the sex, which is, says Mr Osborne, "so great, that a woman is the most cowardly of all the creatures God ever made;"一a sentiment more remarkable for its bluntness than for its truth. Aristotle, in his Politics, doth them, I believe, more justice, when he says, "The modesty and fortitude of men differ from those virtues in women; for the fortitude which becomes a woman, would be cowardice in a man; and the modesty which becomes a man, would be pertness in a woman." Nor is there, perhaps, more of truth in the opinion of those who derive the partiality which women are inclined to show to the brave, from this excess of their fear. Mr Bayle (I think, in his article of Helen) imputes this, and with greater probability, to their violent love of glory; for the truth of which, we have the authority of him who of all others saw farthest into human nature, and who introduces the heroine of his Odyssey, the great pattern of matrimonial love and constancy, assigning the glory of her husband as the only source of her affection towards him. 2
However this be, certain it is that the accident operated very strongly on Sophia; and, indeed, after much enquiry into the matter, I am inclined to believe, that, at this very time, the charming Sophia made no less impression on the heart of Jones; to say truth, he had for some time become sensible of the irresistible power of her charms.
2.The English reader will not find this in the poem; for the sentiment is entirely left out in the translation.

Chapter 且 T
The arrival of a surgeon.—His operations, and a long dialogue between Sophia and her maid.
When they arrived at Mr Western's hall, Sophia, who had tottered along with much difficulty, sunk down in her chair; but by the assistance of hartshorn and water, she was prevented from fainting away, and had pretty well recovered her spirits, when the surgeon who was sent for to Jones appeared. Mr Western, who imputed these symptoms in his daughter to her fall, advised her to be presently blooded by way of prevention. In this opinion he was seconded by the surgeon, who gave so many reasons for bleeding, and quoted so many cases where persons had miscarried for want of it, that the squire became very importunate, and indeed insisted peremptorily that his daughter should be blooded.
Sophia soon yielded to the commands of her father, though entirely contrary to her own inclinations, for she suspected, I believe, less danger from the fright, than either the squire or the surgeon. She then stretched out her beautiful arm, and the operator began to prepare for his work.
While the servants were busied in providing materials, the surgeon, who imputed the backwardness which had appeared in Sophia to her fears, began to comfort her with assurances that there was not the least danger; for no accident, he said, could ever happen in bleeding, but from the monstrous ignorance of pretenders to surgery, which he pretty plainly insinuated was not at present to be apprehended. Sophia declared she was not under the least apprehension; adding, "If you open an artery, I promise you I'll forgive you." "Will you?" cries Western: "D一n me, if I will. If he does thee the least mischief, d一n me if I don't ha' the heart's blood o'un out." The surgeon assented to bleed her upon these conditions, and then proceeded to his operation, which he performed with as much dexterity as he had promised; and with as much quickness: for he took but little blood from her, saying, it was much safer to bleed again and again, than to take away too much at once.
169
Sophia, when her arm was bound up, retired: for she was not willing (nor was it, perhaps, strictly decent) to be present at the operation on Jones. Indeed, one objection which she had to bleeding (though she did not make it) was the delay which it would occasion to setting the broken bone. For Western, when Sophia was concerned, had no consideration but for her; and as for Jones himself, he "sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief." To say the truth, when he saw the blood springing from the lovely arm of Sophia, he scarce thought of what had happened to himself.
The surgeon now ordered his patient to be stript to his shirt, and then entirely baring the arm, he began to stretch and examine it, in such a manner that the tortures he put him to caused Jones to make several wry faces; which the surgeon observing, greatly wondered at, crying, "What is the matter, sir? I am sure it is impossible I should hurt you." And then holding forth the broken arm, he began a long and very learned lecture of anatomy, in which simple and double fractures were most accurately considered; and the several ways in which Jones might have broken his arm were discussed, with proper annotations showing how many of these would have been better, and how many worse than the present case.
Having at length finished his laboured harangue, with which the audience, though it had greatly raised their attention and admiration, were not much edified, as they really understood not a single syllable of all he had said, he proceeded to business, which he was more expeditious in finishing, than he had been in beginning.
Jones was then ordered into a bed, which Mr Western compelled him to accept at his own house, and sentence of water-gruel was passed upon him.
Among the good company which had attended in the hall during the bone-setting, Mrs Honour was one; who being summoned to her mistress as soon as it was over, and asked by her how the young gentleman did, presently launched into extravagant praises on the magnanimity, as she called it, of his behaviour, which, she said, "was so charming in so pretty a creature." She then burst forth into much warmer encomiums on the beauty of his person; enumerating many particulars, and ending with the whiteness of his skin.
This discourse had an effect on Sophia's countenance, which would not perhaps have escaped the observance of the sagacious waiting-woman, had she once looked her mistress in the face, all the time she was
170
speaking: but as a looking-glass, which was most commodiously placed opposite to her, gave her an opportunity of surveying those features, in which, of all others, she took most delight; so she had not once removed her eyes from that amiable object during her whole speech.
Mrs Honour was so intirely wrapped up in the subject on which she exercised her tongue, and the object before her eyes, that she gave her mistress time to conquer her confusion; which having done, she smiled on her maid, and told her, "she was certainly in love with this young fel-low."一"I in love, madam!" answers she: "upon my word, ma'am, I assure you, ma'am, upon my soul, ma'am, I am not."一"Why, if you was," cries her mistress, "I see no reason that you should be ashamed of it; for he is certainly a pretty fellow."一"Yes, ma'am," answered the other, "that he is, the most handsomest man I ever saw in my life. Yes, to be sure, that he is, and, as your ladyship says, I don't know why I should be ashamed of loving him, though he is my betters. To be sure, gentlefolks are but flesh and blood no more than us servants. Besides, as for Mr Jones, thof Squire Allworthy hath made a gentleman of him, he was not so good as myself by birth: for thof I am a poor body, I am an honest person's child, and my father and mother were married, which is more than some people can say, as high as they hold their heads. Marry, come up! I assure you, my dirty cousin! thof his skin be so white, and to be sure it is the most whitest that ever was seen, I am a Christian as well as he, and nobody can say that I am base born: my grandfather was a clergyman, 3 and would have been very angry, I believe, to have thought any of his family should have taken up with Molly Seagrim's dirty leavings."
Perhaps Sophia might have suffered her maid to run on in this manner, from wanting sufficient spirits to stop her tongue, which the reader may probably conjecture was no very easy task; for certainly there were some passages in her speech which were far from being agreeable to the lady. However, she now checked the torrent, as there seemed no end of its flowing. "I wonder," says she, "at your assurance in daring to talk thus of one of my father's friends. As to the wench, I order you never to mention her name to me. And with regard to the young gentleman's birth, those who can say nothing more to his disadvantage, may as well be silent on that head, as I desire you will be for the future."
3.This is the second person of low condition whom we have recorded in this history to have sprung from the clergy. It is to be hoped such instances will, in future ages, when some provision is made for the families of the inferior clergy, appear stranger than they can be thought at present.
171
"I am sorry I have offended your ladyship," answered Mrs Honour. "I am sure I hate Molly Seagrim as much as your ladyship can; and as for abusing Squire Jones, I can call all the servants in the house to witness, that whenever any talk hath been about bastards, I have always taken his part; for which of you, says I to the footmen, would not be a bastard, if he could, to be made a gentleman of? And, says I, I am sure he is a very fine gentleman; and he hath one of the whitest hands in the world; for to be sure so he hath: and, says I, one of the sweetest temperedest, best naturedest men in the world he is; and, says I, all the servants and neighbours all round the country loves him. And, to be sure, I could tell your ladyship something, but that I am afraid it would offend you."一"What could you tell me, Honour?" says Sophia. "Nay, ma'am, to be sure he meant nothing by it, therefore I would not have your ladyship be offended."—"Prithee tell me," says Sophia; "I will know it this instant."一"Why, ma'am," answered Mrs Honour, "he came into the room one day last week when I was at work, and there lay your ladyship's muff on a chair, and to be sure he put his hands into it; that very muff your ladyship gave me but yesterday. La! says I, Mr Jones, you will stretch my lady's muff, and spoil it: but he still kept his hands in it: and then he kissed it—to be sure I hardly ever saw such a kiss in my life as he gave it."一"I suppose he did not know it was mine," replied Sophia. "Your ladyship shall hear, ma'am. He kissed it again and again, and said it was the prettiest muff in the world. La! sir, says I, you have seen it a hundred times. Yes, Mrs Honour, cried he; but who can see anything beautiful in the presence of your lady but herself?一Nay, that's not all neither; but I hope your ladyship won't be offended, for to be sure he meant nothing. One day, as your ladyship was playing on the harpsichord to my master, Mr Jones was sitting in the next room, and methought he looked melancholy. La! says I, Mr Jones, what's the matter? a penny for your thoughts, says I. Why, hussy, says he, starting up from a dream, what can I be thinking of, when that angel your mistress is playing? And then squeezing me by the hand, Oh! Mrs Honour, says he, how happy will that man be!—and then he sighed. Upon my troth, his breath is as sweet as a nosegay.一But to be sure he meant no harm by it. So I hope your ladyship will not mention a word; for he gave me a crown never to mention it, and made me swear upon a book, but I believe, indeed, it was not the Bible."
Till something of a more beautiful red than vermilion be found out, I shall say nothing of Sophia's colour on this occasion. "Ho一nour," says she, "I—if you will not mention this any more to me—nor to anybody
172
else, I will not betray you一I mean, I will not be angry; but I am afraid of your tongue. Why, my girl, will you give it such liberties?"—"Nay, ma'am," answered she, "to be sure, I would sooner cut out my tongue than offend your ladyship. To be sure I shall never mention a word that your ladyship would not have me."一"Why, I would not have you mention this any more," said Sophia, "for it may come to my father's ears, and he would be angry with Mr Jones; though I really believe, as you say, he meant nothing. I should be very angry myself, if I ima-gined一"一"Nay, ma'am," says Honour, "I protest I believe he meant nothing. I thought he talked as if he was out of his senses; nay, he said he believed he was beside himself when he had spoken the words. Ay, sir, says I, I believe so too. Yes, says he, Honour.一But I ask your ladyship's pardon; I could tear my tongue out for offending you." "Go on," says Sophia; "you may mention anything you have not told me before."一"Yes, Honour, says he (this was some time afterwards, when he gave me the crown), I am neither such a coxcomb, or such a villain, as to think of her in any other delight but as my goddess; as such I will always worship and adore her while I have breath.一This was all, ma'am, I will be sworn, to the best of my remembrance. I was in a passion with him myself, till I found he meant no harm."一"Indeed, Honour," says Sophia, "I believe you have a real affection for me. I was provoked the other day when I gave you warning; but if you have a desire to stay with me, you shall."一"To be sure, ma'am," answered Mrs Honour, "I shall never desire to part with your ladyship. To be sure, I almost cried my eyes out when you gave me warning. It would be very ungrateful in me to desire to leave your ladyship; because as why, I should never get so good a place again. I am sure I would live and die with your ladyship; for, as poor Mr Jones said, happy is the man----"
Here the dinner bell interrupted a conversation which had wrought such an effect on Sophia, that she was, perhaps, more obliged to her bleeding in the morning, than she, at the time, had apprehended she should be. As to the present situation of her mind, I shall adhere to a rule of Horace, by not attempting to describe it, from despair of success. Most of my readers will suggest it easily to themselves; and the few who cannot, would not understand the picture, or at least would deny it to be natural, if ever so well drawn.

Chapter 且
Of the SERIOUS in writing, and for what purpose it is introduced.
Peradventure there may be no parts in this prodigious work which will give the reader less pleasure in the perusing, than those which have given the author the greatest pains in composing. Among these probably may be reckoned those initial essays which we have prefixed to the historical matter contained in every book; and which we have determined to be essentially necessary to this kind of writing, of which we have set ourselves at the head.
For this our determination we do not hold ourselves strictly bound to assign any reason; it being abundantly sufficient that we have laid it down as a rule necessary to be observed in all prosai-comi-epic writing. Who ever demanded the reasons of that nice unity of time or place which is now established to be so essential to dramatic poetry? What critic hath been ever asked, why a play may not contain two days as well as one? Or why the audience (provided they travel, like electors, without any expense) may not be wafted fifty miles as well as five? Hath any commentator well accounted for the limitation which an antient critic hath set to the drama, which he will have contain neither more nor less than five acts? Or hath any one living attempted to explain what the modern judges of our theatres mean by that word low; by which they have happily succeeded in banishing all humour from the stage, and have made the theatre as dull as a drawing-room! Upon all these occasions the world seems to have embraced a maxim of our law, viz., cui-cunque in arte sua perito credendum est: for it seems perhaps difficult to conceive that any one should have had enough of impudence to lay down dogmatical rules in any art or science without the least foundation. In such cases, therefore, we are apt to conclude there are sound and good reasons at the bottom, though we are unfortunately not able to see so far.
Now, in reality, the world have paid too great a compliment to critics, and have imagined them men of much greater profundity than they really are. From this complacence, the critics have been emboldened to
175
assume a dictatorial power, and have so far succeeded, that they are now become the masters, and have the assurance to give laws to those authors from whose predecessors they originally received them.
The critic, rightly considered, is no more than the clerk, whose office it is to transcribe the rules and laws laid down by those great judges whose vast strength of genius hath placed them in the light of legislators, in the several sciences over which they presided. This office was all which the critics of old aspired to; nor did they ever dare to advance a sentence, without supporting it by the authority of the judge from whence it was borrowed.
But in process of time, and in ages of ignorance, the clerk began to invade the power and assume the dignity of his master. The laws of writing were no longer founded on the practice of the author, but on the dictates of the critic. The clerk became the legislator, and those very peremptorily gave laws whose business it was, at first, only to transcribe them.
Hence arose an obvious, and perhaps an unavoidable error; for these critics being men of shallow capacities, very easily mistook mere form for substance. They acted as a judge would, who should adhere to the lifeless letter of law, and reject the spirit. Little circumstances, which were perhaps accidental in a great author, were by these critics considered to constitute his chief merit, and transmitted as essentials to be observed by all his successors. To these encroachments, time and ignorance, the two great supporters of imposture, gave authority; and thus many rules for good writing have been established, which have not the least foundation in truth or nature; and which commonly serve for no other purpose than to curb and restrain genius, in the same manner as it would have restrained the dancing-master, had the many excellent treatises on that art laid it down as an essential rule that every man must dance in chains.
To avoid, therefore, all imputation of laying down a rule for posterity, founded only on the authority of ipse dixit一for which, to say the truth, we have not the profoundest veneration一we shall here waive the privilege above contended for, and proceed to lay before the reader the reasons which have induced us to intersperse these several digressive essays in the course of this work.
And here we shall of necessity be led to open a new vein of knowledge, which if it hath been discovered, hath not, to our remembrance, been wrought on by any antient or modern writer. This vein is no other
176
than that of contrast, which runs through all the works of the creation, and may probably have a large share in constituting in us the idea of all beauty, as well natural as artificial: for what demonstrates the beauty and excellence of anything but its reverse? Thus the beauty of day, and that of summer, is set off by the horrors of night and winter. And, I believe, if it was possible for a man to have seen only the two former, he would have a very imperfect idea of their beauty.
But to avoid too serious an air; can it be doubted, but that the finest woman in the world would lose all benefit of her charms in the eye of a man who had never seen one of another cast? The ladies themselves seem so sensible of this, that they are all industrious to procure foils: nay, they will become foils to themselves; for I have observed (at Bath particularly) that they endeavour to appear as ugly as possible in the morning, in order to set off that beauty which they intend to show you in the evening.
Most artists have this secret in practice, though some, perhaps, have not much studied the theory. The jeweller knows that the finest brilliant requires a foil; and the painter, by the contrast of his figures, often acquires great applause.
A great genius among us will illustrate this matter fully. I cannot, indeed, range him under any general head of common artists, as he hath a title to be placed among those
Inventas qui vitam excoluere per artes. Who by invented arts have life improved.
I mean here the inventor of that most exquisite entertainment, called the English Pantomime.
This entertainment consisted of two parts, which the inventor distinguished by the names of the serious and the comic. The serious exhibited a certain number of heathen gods and heroes, who were certainly the worst and dullest company into which an audience was ever introduced; and (which was a secret known to few) were actually intended so to be, in order to contrast the comic part of the entertainment, and to display the tricks of harlequin to the better advantage.
This was, perhaps, no very civil use of such personages: but the contrivance was, nevertheless, ingenious enough, and had its effect. And this will now plainly appear, if, instead of serious and comic, we supply the words duller and dullest; for the comic was certainly duller than anything before shown on the stage, and could be set off only by that superlative degree of dulness which composed the serious. So intolerably
177
serious, indeed, were these gods and heroes, that harlequin (though the English gentleman of that name is not at all related to the French family, for he is of a much more serious disposition) was always welcome on the stage, as he relieved the audience from worse company.
Judicious writers have always practised this art of contrast with great success. I have been surprized that Horace should cavil at this art in Homer; but indeed he contradicts himself in the very next line:
Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus; Verum opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum.
I grieve if e'er great Homer chance to sleep, Yet slumbers on long works have right to creep.
For we are not here to understand, as perhaps some have, that an author actually falls asleep while he is writing. It is true, that readers are too apt to be so overtaken; but if the work was as long as any of Oldmix-on, the author himself is too well entertained to be subject to the least drowsiness. He is, as Mr Pope observes,
Sleepless himself to give his readers sleep.
To say the truth, these soporific parts are so many scenes of serious artfully interwoven, in order to contrast and set off the rest; and this is the true meaning of a late facetious writer, who told the public that whenever he was dull they might be assured there was a design in it.
In this light, then, or rather in this darkness, I would have the reader to consider these initial essays. And after this warning, if he shall be of opinion that he can find enough of serious in other parts of this history, he may pass over these, in which we profess to be laboriously dull, and begin the following books at the second chapter.

Chapter
In which Mr Jones receives many friendly visits during his confinement; with some fine touches of the passion of love, scarce visible to the naked eye.
Tom Jones had many visitors during his confinement, though some, perhaps, were not very agreeable to him. Mr Allworthy saw him almost every day; but though he pitied Tom's sufferings, and greatly approved the gallant behaviour which had occasioned them; yet he thought this was a favourable opportunity to bring him to a sober sense of his indiscreet conduct; and that wholesome advice for that purpose could never be applied at a more proper season than at the present, when the mind was softened by pain and sickness, and alarmed by danger; and when its attention was unembarrassed with those turbulent passions which engage us in the pursuit of pleasure.
At all seasons, therefore, when the good man was alone with the youth, especially when the latter was totally at ease, he took occasion to remind him of his former miscarriages, but in the mildest and tenderest manner, and only in order to introduce the caution which he prescribed for his future behaviour; "on which alone," he assured him, "would depend his own felicity, and the kindness which he might yet promise himself to receive at the hands of his father by adoption, unless he should hereafter forfeit his good opinion: for as to what had past," he said, "it should be all forgiven and forgotten. He therefore advised him to make a good use of this accident, that so in the end it might prove a visitation for his own good."
Thwackum was likewise pretty assiduous in his visits; and he too considered a sick-bed to be a convenient scene for lectures. His stile, however, was more severe than Mr Allworthy's: he told his pupil, "That he ought to look on his broken limb as a judgment from heaven on his sins. That it would become him to be daily on his knees, pouring forth thanksgivings that he had broken his arm only, and not his neck; which latter," he said, "was very probably reserved for some future occasion,
179
and that, perhaps, not very remote. For his part," he said, "he had often wondered some judgment had not overtaken him before; but it might be perceived by this, that Divine punishments, though slow, are always sure." Hence likewise he advised him, "to foresee, with equal certainty, the greater evils which were yet behind, and which were as sure as this of overtaking him in his state of reprobacy. These are," said he, "to be averted only by such a thorough and sincere repentance as is not to be expected or hoped for from one so abandoned in his youth, and whose mind, I am afraid, is totally corrupted. It is my duty, however, to exhort you to this repentance, though I too well know all exhortations will be vain and fruitless. But liberavi animam meam. I can accuse my own conscience of no neglect; though it is at the same time with the utmost concern I see you travelling on to certain misery in this world, and to as certain damnation in the next."
Square talked in a very different strain; he said, "Such accidents as a broken bone were below the consideration of a wise man. That it was abundantly sufficient to reconcile the mind to any of these mischances, to reflect that they are liable to befal the wisest of mankind, and are undoubtedly for the good of the whole." He said, "It was a mere abuse of words to call those things evils, in which there was no moral unfitness: that pain, which was the worst consequence of such accidents, was the most contemptible thing in the world;" with more of the like sentences, extracted out of the second book of Tully's Tusculan questions, and from the great Lord Shaftesbury. In pronouncing these he was one day so eager, that he unfortunately bit his tongue; and in such a manner, that it not only put an end to his discourse, but created much emotion in him, and caused him to mutter an oath or two: but what was worst of all, this accident gave Thwackum, who was present, and who held all such doctrine to be heathenish and atheistical, an opportunity to clap a judgment on his back. Now this was done with so malicious a sneer, that it totally unhinged (if I may so say) the temper of the philosopher, which the bite of his tongue had somewhat ruffled; and as he was disabled from venting his wrath at his lips, he had possibly found a more violent method of revenging himself, had not the surgeon, who was then luckily in the room, contrary to his own interest, interposed and preserved the peace.
Mr Blifil visited his friend Jones but seldom, and never alone. This worthy young man, however, professed much regard for him, and as great concern at his misfortune; but cautiously avoided any intimacy, lest, as he frequently hinted, it might contaminate the sobriety of his own character: for which purpose he had constantly in his mouth that
180
proverb in which Solomon speaks against evil communication. Not that he was so bitter as Thwackum; for he always expressed some hopes of Tom's reformation; "which," he said, "the unparalleled goodness shown by his uncle on this occasion, must certainly effect in one not absolutely abandoned:" but concluded, "if Mr Jones ever offends hereafter, I shall not be able to say a syllable in his favour."
As to Squire Western, he was seldom out of the sick-room, unless when he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle. Nay, he would sometimes retire hither to take his beer, and it was not without difficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his beer too: for no quack ever held his nostrum to be a more general panacea than he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in all the physic in an apothecary's shop. He was, however, by much entreaty, prevailed on to forbear the application of this medicine; but from serenading his patient every hunting morning with the horn under his window, it was impossible to withhold him; nor did he ever lay aside that hallow, with which he entered into all companies, when he visited Jones, without any regard to the sick person's being at that time either awake or asleep.
This boisterous behaviour, as it meant no harm, so happily it effected none, and was abundantly compensated to Jones, as soon as he was able to sit up, by the company of Sophia, whom the squire then brought to visit him; nor was it, indeed, long before Jones was able to attend her to the harpsichord, where she would kindly condescend, for hours together, to charm him with the most delicious music, unless when the squire thought proper to interrupt her, by insisting on Old Sir Simon, or some other of his favourite pieces.
Notwithstanding the nicest guard which Sophia endeavoured to set on her behaviour, she could not avoid letting some appearances now and then slip forth: for love may again be likened to a disease in this, that when it is denied a vent in one part, it will certainly break out in another. What her lips, therefore, concealed, her eyes, her blushes, and many little involuntary actions, betrayed.
One day, when Sophia was playing on the harpsichord, and Jones was attending, the squire came into the room, crying, "There, Tom, I have had a battle for thee below-stairs with thick parson Thwackum. He hath been a telling Allworthy, before my face, that the broken bone was a judgment upon thee. D一n it, says I, how can that be? Did he not come by it in defence of a young woman? A judgment indeed! Pox, if he never doth anything worse, he will go to heaven sooner than all the parsons in the
181
country. He hath more reason to glory in it than to be ashamed of it."一"Indeed, sir," says Jones, "I have no reason for either; but if it preserved Miss Western, I shall always think it the happiest accident of my life."一"And to gu," said the squire, "to zet Allworthy against thee vor it! D一n un, if the parson had unt his petticuoats on, I should have lent un o flick; for I love thee dearly, my boy, and d一n me if there is anything in my power which I won't do for thee. Sha't take thy choice of all the horses in my stable to-morrow morning, except only the Chevalier and Miss Slouch." Jones thanked him, but declined accepting the offer. "Nay," added the squire, "sha't ha the sorrel mare that Sophy rode. She cost me fifty guineas, and comes six years old this grass." "If she had cost me a thousand," cries Jones passionately, "I would have given her to the dogs." "Pooh! pooh!" answered Western; "what! because she broke thy arm? Shouldst forget and forgive. I thought hadst been more a man than to bear malice against a dumb creature."一Here Sophia interposed, and put an end to the conversation, by desiring her father's leave to play to him; a request which he never refused.
The countenance of Sophia had undergone more than one change during the foregoing speeches; and probably she imputed the passionate resentment which Jones had expressed against the mare, to a different motive from that from which her father had derived it. Her spirits were at this time in a visible flutter; and she played so intolerably ill, that had not Western soon fallen asleep, he must have remarked it. Jones, however, who was sufficiently awake, and was not without an ear any more than without eyes, made some observations; which being joined to all which the reader may remember to have passed formerly, gave him pretty strong assurances, when he came to reflect on the whole, that all was not well in the tender bosom of Sophia; an opinion which many young gentlemen will, I doubt not, extremely wonder at his not having been well confirmed in long ago. To confess the truth, he had rather too much diffidence in himself, and was not forward enough in seeing the advances of a young lady; a misfortune which can be cured only by that early town education, which is at present so generally in fashion.
When these thoughts had fully taken possession of Jones, they occasioned a perturbation in his mind, which, in a constitution less pure and firm than his, might have been, at such a season, attended with very dangerous consequences. He was truly sensible of the great worth of Sophia. He extremely liked her person, no less admired her accomplishments, and tenderly loved her goodness. In reality, as he had never once entertained any thought of possessing her, nor had ever given the least
182
voluntary indulgence to his inclinations, he had a much stronger passion for her than he himself was acquainted with. His heart now brought forth the full secret, at the same time that it assured him the adorable object returned his affection.

Chapter U
Which all who have no heart will think to contain much ado about nothing.
The reader will perhaps imagine the sensations which now arose in Jones to have been so sweet and delicious, that they would rather tend to produce a chearful serenity in the mind, than any of those dangerous effects which we have mentioned; but in fact, sensations of this kind, however delicious, are, at their first recognition, of a very tumultuous nature, and have very little of the opiate in them. They were, moreover, in the present case, embittered with certain circumstances, which being mixed with sweeter ingredients, tended altogether to compose a draught that might be termed bitter-sweet; than which, as nothing can be more disagreeable to the palate, so nothing, in the metaphorical sense, can be so injurious to the mind.
For first, though he had sufficient foundation to flatter himself in what he had observed in Sophia, he was not yet free from doubt of misconstruing compassion, or at best, esteem, into a warmer regard. He was far from a sanguine assurance that Sophia had any such affection towards him, as might promise his inclinations that harvest, which, if they were encouraged and nursed, they would finally grow up to require. Besides, if he could hope to find no bar to his happiness from the daughter, he thought himself certain of meeting an effectual bar in the father; who, though he was a country squire in his diversions, was perfectly a man of the world in whatever regarded his fortune; had the most violent affection for his only daughter, and had often signified, in his cups, the pleasure he proposed in seeing her married to one of the richest men in the county. Jones was not so vain and senseless a coxcomb as to expect, from any regard which Western had professed for him, that he would ever be induced to lay aside these views of advancing his daughter. He well knew that fortune is generally the principal, if not the sole, consideration, which operates on the best of parents in these matters: for friendship makes us warmly espouse the interest of others; but it is very cold
184
to the gratification of their passions. Indeed, to feel the happiness which may result from this, it is necessary we should possess the passion ourselves. As he had therefore no hopes of obtaining her father's consent; so he thought to endeavour to succeed without it, and by such means to frustrate the great point of Mr Western's life, was to make a very ill use of his hospitality, and a very ungrateful return to the many little favours received (however roughly) at his hands. If he saw such a consequence with horror and disdain, how much more was he shocked with what regarded Mr Allworthy; to whom, as he had more than filial obligations, so had he for him more than filial piety! He knew the nature of that good man to be so averse to any baseness or treachery, that the least attempt of such a kind would make the sight of the guilty person for ever odious to his eyes, and his name a detestable sound in his ears. The appearance of such unsurmountable difficulties was sufficient to have inspired him with despair, however ardent his wishes had been; but even these were contruoled by compassion for another woman. The idea of lovely Molly now intruded itself before him. He had sworn eternal constancy in her arms, and she had as often vowed never to out-live his deserting her. He now saw her in all the most shocking postures of death; nay, he considered all the miseries of prostitution to which she would be liable, and of which he would be doubly the occasion; first by seducing, and then by deserting her; for he well knew the hatred which all her neighbours, and even her own sisters, bore her, and how ready they would all be to tear her to pieces. Indeed, he had exposed her to more envy than shame, or rather to the latter by means of the former: for many women abused her for being a whore, while they envied her her lover, and her finery, and would have been themselves glad to have purchased these at the same rate. The ruin, therefore, of the poor girl must, he foresaw, unavoidably attend his deserting her; and this thought stung him to the soul. Poverty and distress seemed to him to give none a right of aggravating those misfortunes. The meanness of her condition did not represent her misery as of little consequence in his eyes, nor did it appear to justify, or even to palliate, his guilt, in bringing that misery upon her. But why do I mention justification? His own heart would not suffer him to destroy a human creature who, he thought, loved him, and had to that love sacrificed her innocence. His own good heart pleaded her cause; not as a cold venal advocate, but as one interested in the event, and which must itself deeply share in all the agonies its owner brought on another.
When this powerful advocate had sufficiently raised the pity of Jones, by painting poor Molly in all the circumstances of wretchedness; it
185
artfully called in the assistance of another passion, and represented the girl in all the amiable colours of youth, health, and beauty; as one greatly the object of desire, and much more so, at least to a good mind, from being, at the same time, the object of compassion.
Amidst these thoughts, poor Jones passed a long sleepless night, and in the morning the result of the whole was to abide by Molly, and to think no more of Sophia.
In this virtuous resolution he continued all the next day till the evening, cherishing the idea of Molly, and driving Sophia from his thoughts; but in the fatal evening, a very trifling accident set all his passions again on float, and worked so total a change in his mind, that we think it decent to communicate it in a fresh chapter.
186
A little chapter, in which is contained a little incident.
Among other visitants, who paid their compliments to the young gentleman in his confinement, Mrs Honour was one. The reader, perhaps, when he reflects on some expressions which have formerly dropt from her, may conceive that she herself had a very particular affection for Mr Jones; but, in reality, it was no such thing. Tom was a handsome young fellow; and for that species of men Mrs Honour had some regard; but this was perfectly indiscriminate; for having being crossed in the love which she bore a certain nobleman's footman, who had basely deserted her after a promise of marriage, she had so securely kept together the broken remains of her heart, that no man had ever since been able to possess himself of any single fragment. She viewed all handsome men with that equal regard and benevolence which a sober and virtuous mind bears to all the good. She might indeed be called a lover of men, as Socrates was a lover of mankind, preferring one to another for corporeal, as he for mental qualifications; but never carrying this preference so far as to cause any perturbation in the philosophical serenity of her temper.
The day after Mr Jones had that conflict with himself which we have seen in the preceding chapter, Mrs Honour came into his room, and finding him alone, began in the following manner:一"La, sir, where do you think I have been? I warrants you, you would not guess in fifty years; but if you did guess, to be sure I must not tell you neither."一"Nay, if it be something which you must not tell me," said Jones, "I shall have the curiosity to enquire, and I know you will not be so barbarous to refuse me."—"I don't know," cries she, "why I should refuse you neither, for that matter; for to be sure you won't mention it any more. And for that matter, if you knew where I have been, unless you knew what I have been about, it would not signify much. Nay, I don't see why it should be kept a secret for my part; for to be sure she is the best lady in the world." Upon this, Jones began to beg earnestly to be let into this secret, and faithfully promised not to divulge it. She then proceeded thus:一"Why,
187
you must know, sir, my young lady sent me to enquire after Molly Seagrim, and to see whether the wench wanted anything; to be sure, I did not care to go, methinks; but servants must do what they are ordered.一How could you undervalue yourself so, Mr Jones?一So my lady bid me go and carry her some linen, and other things. She is too good. If such forward sluts were sent to Bridewell, it would be better for them. I told my lady, says I, madam, your la'ship is encouraging idleness."一"And was my Sophia so good?" says Jones. "My Sophia! I assure you, marry come up," answered Honour. "And yet if you knew all一indeed, if I was as Mr Jones, I should look a little higher than such trumpery as Molly Seagrim." "What do you mean by these words," replied Jones, "if I knew all?" "I mean what I mean," says Honour. "Don't you remember putting your hands in my lady's muff once? I vow I could almost find in my heart to tell, if I was certain my lady would never come to the hearing on't." Jones then made several solemn protestations. And Honour proceeded一"Then to be sure, my lady gave me that muff; and afterwards, upon hearing what you had done"一"Then you told her what I had done?" interrupted Jones. "If I did, sir," answered she, "you need not be angry with me. Many's the man would have given his head to have had my lady told, if they had known,一for, to be sure, the biggest lord in the land might be proud一but, I protest, I have a great mind not to tell you." Jones fell to entreaties, and soon prevailed on her to go on thus. "You must know then, sir, that my lady had given this muff to me; but about a day or two after I had told her the story, she quarrels with her new muff, and to be sure it is the prettiest that ever was seen. Honour, says she, this is an odious muff; it is too big for me, I can't wear it: till I can get another, you must let me have my old one again, and you may have this in the room on't一for she's a good lady, and scorns to give a thing and take a thing, I promise you that. So to be sure I fetched it her back again, and, I believe, she hath worn it upon her arm almost ever since, and I warrants hath given it many a kiss when nobody hath seen her."
Here the conversation was interrupted by Mr Western himself, who came to summon Jones to the harpsichord; whither the poor young fellow went all pale and trembling. This Western observed, but, on seeing Mrs Honour, imputed it to a wrong cause; and having given Jones a hearty curse between jest and earnest, he bid him beat abroad, and not poach up the game in his warren.
188
Sophia looked this evening with more than usual beauty, and we may believe it was no small addition to her charms, in the eye of Mr Jones, that she now happened to have on her right arm this very muff.
She was playing one of her father's favourite tunes, and he was leaning on her chair, when the muff fell over her fingers, and put her out. This so disconcerted the squire, that he snatched the muff from her, and with a hearty curse threw it into the fire. Sophia instantly started up, and with the utmost eagerness recovered it from the flames.
Though this incident will probably appear of little consequence to many of our readers; yet, trifling as it was, it had so violent an effect on poor Jones, that we thought it our duty to relate it. In reality, there are many little circumstances too often omitted by injudicious historians, from which events of the utmost importance arise. The world may indeed be considered as a vast machine, in which the great wheels are originally set in motion by those which are very minute, and almost imperceptible to any but the strongest eyes.
Thus, not all the charms of the incomparable Sophia; not all the dazzling brightness, and languishing softness of her eyes; the harmony of her voice, and of her person; not all her wit, good-humour, greatness of mind, or sweetness of disposition, had been able so absolutely to conquer and enslave the heart of poor Jones, as this little incident of the muff. Thus the poet sweetly sings of Troy一
一Captique dolis lachrymisque coacti Quos neque Tydides, nec Larissaeus Achilles, Non anni domuere decem, non mille Carinae.
What Diomede or Thetis' greater son, A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege had done False tears and fawning words the city won.
The citadel of Jones was now taken by surprize. All those considerations of honour and prudence which our heroe had lately with so much military wisdom placed as guards over the avenues of his heart, ran away from their posts, and the god of love marched in, in triumph.
189

Chapter U
A very long chapter, containing a very great incident.
But though this victorious deity easily expelled his avowed enemies from the heart of Jones, he found it more difficult to supplant the garrison which he himself had placed there. To lay aside all allegory, the concern for what must become of poor Molly greatly disturbed and perplexed the mind of the worthy youth. The superior merit of Sophia totally eclipsed, or rather extinguished, all the beauties of the poor girl; but compassion instead of contempt succeeded to love. He was convinced the girl had placed all her affections, and all her prospect of future happiness, in him only. For this he had, he knew, given sufficient occasion, by the utmost profusion of tenderness towards her: a tenderness which he had taken every means to persuade her he would always maintain. She, on her side, had assured him of her firm belief in his promise, and had with the most solemn vows declared, that on his fulfilling or breaking these promises, it depended, whether she should be the happiest or most miserable of womankind. And to be the author of this highest degree of misery to a human being, was a thought on which he could not bear to ruminate a single moment. He considered this poor girl as having sacrificed to him everything in her little power; as having been at her own expense the object of his pleasure; as sighing and languishing for him even at that very instant. Shall then, says he, my recovery, for which she hath so ardently wished; shall my presence, which she hath so eagerly expected, instead of giving her that joy with which she hath flattered herself, cast her at once down into misery and despair? Can I be such a villain? Here, when the genius of poor Molly seemed triumphant, the love of Sophia towards him, which now appeared no longer dubious, rushed upon his mind, and bore away every obstacle before it.
At length it occurred to him, that he might possibly be able to make Molly amends another way; namely, by giving her a sum of money. This, nevertheless, he almost despaired of her accepting, when he recollected
190
the frequent and vehement assurances he had received from her, that the world put in balance with him would make her no amends for his loss. However, her extreme poverty, and chiefly her egregious vanity (somewhat of which hath been already hinted to the reader), gave him some little hope, that, notwithstanding all her avowed tenderness, she might in time be brought to content herself with a fortune superior to her expectation, and which might indulge her vanity, by setting her above all her equals. He resolved therefore to take the first opportunity of making a proposal of this kind.
One day, accordingly, when his arm was so well recovered that he could walk easily with it slung in a sash, he stole forth, at a season when the squire was engaged in his field exercises, and visited his fair one. Her mother and sisters, whom he found taking their tea, informed him first that Molly was not at home; but afterwards the eldest sister acquainted him, with a malicious smile, that she was above stairs a-bed. Tom had no objection to this situation of his mistress, and immediately ascended the ladder which led towards her bed-chamber; but when he came to the top, he, to his great surprize, found the door fast; nor could he for some time obtain any answer from within; for Molly, as she herself afterwards informed him, was fast asleep.
The extremes of grief and joy have been remarked to produce very similar effects; and when either of these rushes on us by surprize, it is apt to create such a total perturbation and confusion, that we are often thereby deprived of the use of all our faculties. It cannot therefore be wondered at, that the unexpected sight of Mr Jones should so strongly operate on the mind of Molly, and should overwhelm her with such confusion, that for some minutes she was unable to express the great raptures, with which the reader will suppose she was affected on this occasion. As for Jones, he was so entirely possessed, and as it were enchanted, by the presence of his beloved object, that he for a while forgot Sophia, and consequently the principal purpose of his visit.
This, however, soon recurred to his memory; and after the first transports of their meeting were over, he found means by degrees to introduce a discourse on the fatal consequences which must attend their amour, if Mr Allworthy, who had strictly forbidden him ever seeing her more, should discover that he still carried on this commerce. Such a discovery, which his enemies gave him reason to think would be unavoidable, must, he said, end in his ruin, and consequently in hers. Since therefore their hard fates had determined that they must separate, he advised her to bear it with resolution, and swore he would never omit any
191
opportunity, through the course of his life, of showing her the sincerity of his affection, by providing for her in a manner beyond her utmost expectation, or even beyond her wishes, if ever that should be in his power; concluding at last, that she might soon find some man who would marry her, and who would make her much happier than she could be by leading a disreputable life with him.
Molly remained a few moments in silence, and then bursting into a flood of tears, she began to upbraid him in the following words: "And this is your love for me, to forsake me in this manner, now you have ruined me! How often, when I have told you that all men are false and perjury alike, and grow tired of us as soon as ever they have had their wicked wills of us, how often have you sworn you would never forsake me! And can you be such a perjury man after all? What signifies all the riches in the world to me without you, now you have gained my heart, so you have一you have一? Why do you mention another man to me? I can never love any other man as long as I live. All other men are nothing to me. If the greatest squire in all the country would come a suiting to me to-morrow, I would not give my company to him. No, I shall always hate and despise the whole sex for your sake."一
She was proceeding thus, when an accident put a stop to her tongue, before it had run out half its career. The room, or rather garret, in which Molly lay, being up one pair of stairs, that is to say, at the top of the house, was of a sloping figure, resembling the great Delta of the Greeks. The English reader may perhaps form a better idea of it, by being told that it was impossible to stand upright anywhere but in the middle. Now, as this room wanted the conveniency of a closet, Molly had, to supply that defect, nailed up an old rug against the rafters of the house, which enclosed a little hole where her best apparel, such as the remains of that sack which we have formerly mentioned, some caps, and other things with which she had lately provided herself, were hung up and secured from the dust.
This enclosed place exactly fronted the foot of the bed, to which, indeed, the rug hung so near, that it served in a manner to supply the want of curtains. Now, whether Molly, in the agonies of her rage, pushed this rug with her feet; or Jones might touch it; or whether the pin or nail gave way of its own accord, I am not certain; but as Molly pronounced those last words, which are recorded above, the wicked rug got loose from its fastening, and discovered everything hid behind it; where among other female utensils appeared—(with shame I write it, and with sorrow will it be read)一the philosopher Square, in a posture (for the place would not
192
near admit his standing upright) as ridiculous as can possibly be conceived.
The posture, indeed, in which he stood, was not greatly unlike that of a soldier who is tied neck and heels; or rather resembling the attitude in which we often see fellows in the public streets of London, who are not suffering but deserving punishment by so standing. He had a nightcap belonging to Molly on his head, and his two large eyes, the moment the rug fell, stared directly at Jones; so that when the idea of philosophy was added to the figure now discovered, it would have been very difficult for any spectator to have refrained from immoderate laughter.
I question not but the surprize of the reader will be here equal to that of Jones; as the suspicions which must arise from the appearance of this wise and grave man in such a place, may seem so inconsistent with that character which he hath, doubtless, maintained hitherto, in the opinion of every one.
But to confess the truth, this inconsistency is rather imaginary than real. Philosophers are composed of flesh and blood as well as other human creatures; and however sublimated and refined the theory of these may be, a little practical frailty is as incident to them as to other mortals. It is, indeed, in theory only, and not in practice, as we have before hinted, that consists the difference: for though such great beings think much better and more wisely, they always act exactly like other men. They know very well how to subdue all appetites and passions, and to despise both pain and pleasure; and this knowledge affords much delightful contemplation, and is easily acquired; but the practice would be vexatious and troublesome; and, therefore, the same wisdom which teaches them to know this, teaches them to avoid carrying it into execution.
Mr Square happened to be at church on that Sunday, when, as the reader may be pleased to remember, the appearance of Molly in her sack had caused all that disturbance. Here he first observed her, and was so pleased with her beauty, that he prevailed with the young gentlemen to change their intended ride that evening, that he might pass by the habitation of Molly, and by that means might obtain a second chance of seeing her. This reason, however, as he did not at that time mention to any, so neither did we think proper to communicate it then to the reader.
Among other particulars which constituted the unfitness of things in Mr Square's opinion, danger and difficulty were two. The difficulty therefore which he apprehended there might be in corrupting this young wench, and the danger which would accrue to his character on the
193
discovery, were such strong dissuasives, that it is probable he at first intended to have contented himself with the pleasing ideas which the sight of beauty furnishes us with. These the gravest men, after a full meal of serious meditation, often allow themselves by way of dessert: for which purpose, certain books and pictures find their way into the most private recesses of their study, and a certain liquorish part of natural philosophy is often the principal subject of their conversation.
But when the philosopher heard, a day or two afterwards, that the fortress of virtue had already been subdued, he began to give a larger scope to his desires. His appetite was not of that squeamish kind which cannot feed on a dainty because another hath tasted it. In short, he liked the girl the better for the want of that chastity, which, if she had possessed it, must have been a bar to his pleasures; he pursued and obtained her.
The reader will be mistaken, if he thinks Molly gave Square the preference to her younger lover: on the contrary, had she been confined to the choice of one only, Tom Jones would undoubtedly have been, of the two, the victorious person. Nor was it solely the consideration that two are better than one (though this had its proper weight) to which Mr Square owed his success: the absence of Jones during his confinement was an unlucky circumstance; and in that interval some well-chosen presents from the philosopher so softened and unguarded the girl's heart, that a favourable opportunity became irresistible, and Square triumphed over the poor remains of virtue which subsisted in the bosom of Molly.
It was now about a fortnight since this conquest, when Jones paid the above-mentioned visit to his mistress, at a time when she and Square were in bed together. This was the true reason why the mother denied her as we have seen; for as the old woman shared in the profits arising from the iniquity of her daughter, she encouraged and protected her in it to the utmost of her power; but such was the envy and hatred which the elder sister bore towards Molly, that, notwithstanding she had some part of the booty, she would willingly have parted with this to ruin her sister and spoil her trade. Hence she had acquainted Jones with her being above-stairs in bed, in hopes that he might have caught her in Square's arms. This, however, Molly found means to prevent, as the door was fastened; which gave her an opportunity of conveying her lover behind that rug or blanket where he now was unhappily discovered.
Square no sooner made his appearance than Molly flung herself back in her bed, cried out she was undone, and abandoned herself to despair.
194
This poor girl, who was yet but a novice in her business, had not arrived to that perfection of assurance which helps off a town lady in any extremity; and either prompts her with an excuse, or else inspires her to brazen out the matter with her husband, who, from love of quiet, or out of fear of his reputation一and sometimes, perhaps, from fear of the gallant, who, like Mr Constant in the play, wears a sword一is glad to shut his eyes, and content to put his horns in his pocket. Molly, on the contrary, was silenced by this evidence, and very fairly gave up a cause which she had hitherto maintained with so many tears, and with such solemn and vehement protestations of the purest love and constancy.
As to the gentleman behind the arras, he was not in much less consternation. He stood for a while motionless, and seemed equally at a loss what to say, or whither to direct his eyes. Jones, though perhaps the most astonished of the three, first found his tongue; and being immediately recovered from those uneasy sensations which Molly by her upbraidings had occasioned, he burst into a loud laughter, and then saluting Mr Square, advanced to take him by the hand, and to relieve him from his place of confinement.
Square being now arrived in the middle of the room, in which part only he could stand upright, looked at Jones with a very grave countenance, and said to him, "Well, sir, I see you enjoy this mighty discovery, and, I dare swear, take great delight in the thoughts of exposing me; but if you will consider the matter fairly, you will find you are yourself only to blame. I am not guilty of corrupting innocence. I have done nothing for which that part of the world which judges of matters by the rule of right, will condemn me. Fitness is governed by the nature of things, and not by customs, forms, or municipal laws. Nothing is indeed unfit which is not unnatural."—"Well reasoned, old boy," answered Jones; "but why dost thou think that I should desire to expose thee? I promise thee, I was never better pleased with thee in my life; and unless thou hast a mind to discover it thyself, this affair may remain a profound secret for me."一"Nay, Mr Jones," replied Square, "I would not be thought to undervalue reputation. Good fame is a species of the Kalon, and it is by no means fitting to neglect it. Besides, to murder one's own reputation is a kind of suicide, a detestable and odious vice. If you think proper, therefore, to conceal any infirmity of mine (for such I may have, since no man is perfectly perfect), I promise you I will not betray myself. Things may be fitting to be done, which are not fitting to be boasted of; for by the perverse judgment of the world, that often becomes the subject of censure, which is, in truth, not only innocent but laudable."一"Right!" cries
195
Jones: "what can be more innocent than the indulgence of a natural appetite? or what more laudable than the propagation of our species?"一"To be serious with you," answered Square, "I profess they always appeared so to me."一"And yet," said Jones, "you was of a different opinion when my affair with this girl was first discovered."—"Why, I must confess," says Square, "as the matter was misrepresented to me, by that parson Thwackum, I might condemn the corruption of innocence: it was that, sir, it was that一and that一: for you must know, Mr Jones, in the consideration of fitness, very minute circumstances, sir, very minute circumstances cause great alteration."—"Well," cries Jones, "be that as it will, it shall be your own fault, as I have promised you, if you ever hear any more of this adventure. Behave kindly to the girl, and I will never open my lips concerning the matter to any one. And, Molly, do you be faithful to your friend, and I will not only forgive your infidelity to me, but will do you all the service I can." So saying, he took a hasty leave, and, slipping down the ladder, retired with much expedition.
Square was rejoiced to find this adventure was likely to have no worse conclusion; and as for Molly, being recovered from her confusion, she began at first to upbraid Square with having been the occasion of her loss of Jones; but that gentleman soon found the means of mitigating her anger, partly by caresses, and partly by a small nostrum from his purse, of wonderful and approved efficacy in purging off the ill humours of the mind, and in restoring it to a good temper.
She then poured forth a vast profusion of tenderness towards her new lover; turned all she had said to Jones, and Jones himself, into ridicule; and vowed, though he once had the possession of her person, that none but Square had ever been master of her heart.
196

By comparing which with the former, the reader may possibly correct some abuse which he hath formerly been guilty of in the application of the word love.
The infidelity of Molly, which Jones had now discovered, would, perhaps, have vindicated a much greater degree of resentment than he expressed on the occasion; and if he had abandoned her directly from that moment, very few, I believe, would have blamed him.
Certain, however, it is, that he saw her in the light of compassion; and though his love to her was not of that kind which could give him any great uneasiness at her inconstancy, yet was he not a little shocked on reflecting that he had himself originally corrupted her innocence; for to this corruption he imputed all the vice into which she appeared now so likely to plunge herself.
This consideration gave him no little uneasiness, till Betty, the elder sister, was so kind, some time afterwards, entirely to cure him by a hint, that one Will Barnes, and not himself, had been the first seducer of Molly; and that the little child, which he had hitherto so certainly concluded to be his own, might very probably have an equal title, at least, to claim Barnes for its father.
Jones eagerly pursued this scent when he had first received it; and in a very short time was sufficiently assured that the girl had told him truth, not only by the confession of the fellow, but at last by that of Molly herself.
This Will Barnes was a country gallant, and had acquired as many trophies of this kind as any ensign or attorney's clerk in the kingdom. He had, indeed, reduced several women to a state of utter profligacy, had broke the hearts of some, and had the honour of occasioning the violent death of one poor girl, who had either drowned herself, or, what was rather more probable, had been drowned by him.
197
Among other of his conquests, this fellow had triumphed over the heart of Betty Seagrim. He had made love to her long before Molly was grown to be a fit object of that pastime; but had afterwards deserted her, and applied to her sister, with whom he had almost immediate success. Now Will had, in reality, the sole possession of Molly's affection, while Jones and Square were almost equally sacrifices to her interest and to her pride.
Hence had grown that implacable hatred which we have before seen raging in the mind of Betty; though we did not think it necessary to assign this cause sooner, as envy itself alone was adequate to all the effects we have mentioned.
Jones was become perfectly easy by possession of this secret with regard to Molly; but as to Sophia, he was far from being in a state of tranquillity; nay, indeed, he was under the most violent perturbation; his heart was now, if I may use the metaphor, entirely evacuated, and Sophia took absolute possession of it. He loved her with an unbounded passion, and plainly saw the tender sentiments she had for him; yet could not this assurance lessen his despair of obtaining the consent of her father, nor the horrors which attended his pursuit of her by any base or treacherous method.
The injury which he must thus do to Mr Western, and the concern which would accrue to Mr Allworthy, were circumstances that tormented him all day, and haunted him on his pillow at night. His life was a constant struggle between honour and inclination, which alternately triumphed over each other in his mind. He often resolved, in the absence of Sophia, to leave her father's house, and to see her no more; and as often, in her presence, forgot all those resolutions, and determined to pursue her at the hazard of his life, and at the forfeiture of what was much dearer to him.
This conflict began soon to produce very strong and visible effects: for he lost all his usual sprightliness and gaiety of temper, and became not only melancholy when alone, but dejected and absent in company; nay, if ever he put on a forced mirth, to comply with Mr Western's humour, the constraint appeared so plain, that he seemed to have been giving the strongest evidence of what he endeavoured to conceal by such ostentation.
It may, perhaps, be a question, whether the art which he used to conceal his passion, or the means which honest nature employed to reveal it, betrayed him most: for while art made him more than ever reserved to
198
Sophia, and forbad him to address any of his discourse to her, nay, to avoid meeting her eyes, with the utmost caution; nature was no less busy in counterplotting him. Hence, at the approach of the young lady, he grew pale; and if this was sudden, started. If his eyes accidentally met hers, the blood rushed into his cheeks, and his countenance became all over scarlet. If common civility ever obliged him to speak to her, as to drink her health at table, his tongue was sure to falter. If he touched her, his hand, nay his whole frame, trembled. And if any discourse tended, however remotely, to raise the idea of love, an involuntary sigh seldom failed to steal from his bosom. Most of which accidents nature was wonderfully industrious to throw daily in his way.
All these symptoms escaped the notice of the squire: but not so of Sophia. She soon perceived these agitations of mind in Jones, and was at no loss to discover the cause; for indeed she recognized it in her own breast. And this recognition is, I suppose, that sympathy which hath been so often noted in lovers, and which will sufficiently account for her being so much quicker-sighted than her father.
But, to say the truth, there is a more simple and plain method of accounting for that prodigious superiority of penetration which we must observe in some men over the rest of the human species, and one which will serve not only in the case of lovers, but of all others. From whence is it that the knave is generally so quick-sighted to those symptoms and operations of knavery, which often dupe an honest man of a much better understanding? There surely is no general sympathy among knaves; nor have they, like freemasons, any common sign of communication. In reality, it is only because they have the same thing in their heads, and their thoughts are turned the same way. Thus, that Sophia saw, and that Western did not see, the plain symptoms of love in Jones can be no wonder, when we consider that the idea of love never entered into the head of the father, whereas the daughter, at present, thought of nothing else.
When Sophia was well satisfied of the violent passion which tormented poor Jones, and no less certain that she herself was its object, she had not the least difficulty in discovering the true cause of his present behaviour. This highly endeared him to her, and raised in her mind two of the best affections which any lover can wish to raise in a mistress—these were, esteem and pity一for sure the most outrageously rigid among her sex will excuse her pitying a man whom she saw miserable on her own account; nor can they blame her for esteeming one who visibly, from the most honourable motives, endeavoured to smother a flame in his own bosom, which, like the famous Spartan theft, was preying upon and
199
consuming his very vitals. Thus his backwardness, his shunning her, his coldness, and his silence, were the forwardest, the most diligent, the warmest, and most eloquent advocates; and wrought so violently on her sensible and tender heart, that she soon felt for him all those gentle sensations which are consistent with a virtuous and elevated female mind. In short, all which esteem, gratitude, and pity, can inspire in such towards an agreeable man一indeed, all which the nicest delicacy can allow. In a word, she was in love with him to distraction.
One day this young couple accidentally met in the garden, at the end of the two walks which were both bounded by that canal in which Jones had formerly risqued drowning to retrieve the little bird that Sophia had there lost.
This place had been of late much frequented by Sophia. Here she used to ruminate, with a mixture of pain and pleasure, on an incident which, however trifling in itself, had possibly sown the first seeds of that affection which was now arrived to such maturity in her heart.
Here then this young couple met. They were almost close together before either of them knew anything of the other's approach. A bystander would have discovered sufficient marks of confusion in the countenance of each; but they felt too much themselves to make any observation. As soon as Jones had a little recovered his first surprize, he accosted the young lady with some of the ordinary forms of salutation, which she in the same manner returned; and their conversation began, as usual, on the delicious beauty of the morning. Hence they past to the beauty of the place, on which Jones launched forth very high encomiums. When they came to the tree whence he had formerly tumbled into the canal, Sophia could not help reminding him of that accident, and said, "I fancy, Mr Jones, you have some little shuddering when you see that water."一"I assure you, madam," answered Jones, "the concern you felt at the loss of your little bird will always appear to me the highest circumstance in that adventure. Poor little Tommy! there is the branch he stood upon. How could the little wretch have the folly to fly away from that state of happiness in which I had the honour to place him? His fate was a just punishment for his ingratitude."一"Upon my word, Mr Jones," said she, "your gallantry very narrowly escaped as severe a fate. Sure the remembrance must affect you."一"Indeed, madam," answered he, "if I have any reason to reflect with sorrow on it, it is, perhaps, that the water had not been a little deeper, by which I might have escaped many bitter heart-aches that Fortune seems to have in store for me."一"Fie, Mr Jones!" replied Sophia; "I am sure you cannot be in earnest now. This affected contempt of life is
200
only an excess of your complacence to me. You would endeavour to lessen the obligation of having twice ventured it for my sake. Beware the third time." She spoke these last words with a smile, and a softness inexpressible. Jones answered with a sigh, "He feared it was already too late for caution:" and then looking tenderly and stedfastly on her, he cried, "Oh, Miss Western! can you desire me to live? Can you wish me so ill?" Sophia, looking down on the ground, answered with some hesitation, "Indeed, Mr Jones, I do not wish you ill."一"Oh, I know too well that heavenly temper," cries Jones, "that divine goodness, which is beyond every other charm."一"Nay, now," answered she, "I understand you not. I can stay no longer."一"I一I would not be understood!" cries he; "nay, I can't be understood. I know not what I say. Meeting you here so unexpectedly, I have been unguarded: for Heaven's sake pardon me, if I have said anything to offend you. I did not mean it. Indeed, I would rather have died一nay, the very thought would kill me."一"You surprize me," answered she. "How can you possibly think you have offended me?"一"Fear, madam," says he, "easily runs into madness; and there is no degree of fear like that which I feel of offending you. How can I speak then? Nay, don't look angrily at me: one frown will destroy me. I mean nothing. Blame my eyes, or blame those beauties. What am I saying? Pardon me if I have said too much. My heart overflowed. I have struggled with my love to the utmost, and have endeavoured to conceal a fever which preys on my vitals, and will, I hope, soon make it impossible for me ever to offend you more."
Mr Jones now fell a trembling as if he had been shaken with the fit of an ague. Sophia, who was in a situation not very different from his, answered in these words: "Mr Jones, I will not affect to misunderstand you; indeed, I understand you too well; but, for Heaven's sake, if you have any affection for me, let me make the best of my way into the house. I wish I may be able to support myself thither."
Jones, who was hardly able to support himself, offered her his arm, which she condescended to accept, but begged he would not mention a word more to her of this nature at present. He promised he would not; insisting only on her forgiveness of what love, without the leave of his will, had forced from him: this, she told him, he knew how to obtain by his future behaviour; and thus this young pair tottered and trembled along, the lover not once daring to squeeze the hand of his mistress, though it was locked in his.
Sophia immediately retired to her chamber, where Mrs Honour and the hartshorn were summoned to her assistance. As to poor Jones, the
201
only relief to his distempered mind was an unwelcome piece of news, which, as it opens a scene of different nature from those in which the reader hath lately been conversant, will be communicated to him in the next chapter.

Chapter /
In which Mr Allworthy appears on a sick-bed.
Mr Western was become so fond of Jones that he was unwilling to part with him, though his arm had been long since cured; and Jones, either from the love of sport, or from some other reason, was easily persuaded to continue at his house, which he did sometimes for a fortnight together without paying a single visit at Mr Allworthy's; nay, without ever hearing from thence.
Mr Allworthy had been for some days indisposed with a cold, which had been attended with a little fever. This he had, however, neglected; as it was usual with him to do all manner of disorders which did not confine him to his bed, or prevent his several faculties from performing their ordinary functions;一a conduct which we would by no means be thought to approve or recommend to imitation; for surely the gentlemen of the Aesculapian art are in the right in advising, that the moment the disease has entered at one door, the physician should be introduced at the other: what else is meant by that old adage, Venienti occurrite morbo? "Oppose a distemper at its first approach." Thus the doctor and the disease meet in fair and equal conflict; whereas, by giving time to the latter, we often suffer him to fortify and entrench himself, like a French army; so that the learned gentleman finds it very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to come at the enemy. Nay, sometimes by gaining time the disease applies to the French military politics, and corrupts nature over to his side, and then all the powers of physic must arrive too late. Agreeable to these observations was, I remember, the complaint of the great Doctor Misaubin, who used very pathetically to lament the late applications which were made to his skill, saying, "Bygar, me believe my pation take me for de undertaker, for dey never send for me till de physicion have kill dem."
Mr Allworthy's distemper, by means of this neglect, gained such ground, that, when the increase of his fever obliged him to send for assistance, the doctor at his first arrival shook his head, wished he had
203
been sent for sooner, and intimated that he thought him in very imminent danger. Mr Allworthy, who had settled all his affairs in this world, and was as well prepared as it is possible for human nature to be for the other, received this information with the utmost calmness and unconcern. He could, indeed, whenever he laid himself down to rest, say with Cato in the tragical poem一
Let guilt or fear Disturb man's rest: Cato knows neither of them; Indifferent in his choice to sleep or die.
In reality, he could say this with ten times more reason and confidence than Cato, or any other proud fellow among the antient or modern heroes; for he was not only devoid of fear, but might be considered as a faithful labourer, when at the end of harvest he is summoned to receive his reward at the hands of a bountiful master.
The good man gave immediate orders for all his family to be summoned round him. None of these were then abroad, but Mrs Blifil, who had been some time in London, and Mr Jones, whom the reader hath just parted from at Mr Western's, and who received this summons just as Sophia had left him.
The news of Mr Allworthy's danger (for the servant told him he was dying) drove all thoughts of love out of his head. He hurried instantly into the chariot which was sent for him, and ordered the coachman to drive with all imaginable haste; nor did the idea of Sophia, I believe, once occur to him on the way.
And now the whole family, namely, Mr Blifil, Mr Jones, Mr Thwack-um, Mr Square, and some of the servants (for such were Mr Allworthy's orders) being all assembled round his bed, the good man sat up in it, and was beginning to speak, when Blifil fell to blubbering, and began to express very loud and bitter lamentations. Upon this Mr Allworthy shook him by the hand, and said, "Do not sorrow thus, my dear nephew, at the most ordinary of all human occurrences. When misfortunes befal our friends we are justly grieved; for those are accidents which might often have been avoided, and which may seem to render the lot of one man more peculiarly unhappy than that of others; but death is certainly unavoidable, and is that common lot in which alone the fortunes of all men agree: nor is the time when this happens to us very material. If the wisest of men hath compared life to a span, surely we may be allowed to consider it as a day. It is my fate to leave it in the evening; but those who are taken away earlier have only lost a few hours, at the best little worth lamenting, and much oftener hours of labour and fatigue, of pain and
204
sorrow. One of the Roman poets, I remember, likens our leaving life to our departure from a feast;一a thought which hath often occurred to me when I have seen men struggling to protract an entertainment, and to enjoy the company of their friends a few moments longer. Alas! how short is the most protracted of such enjoyments! how immaterial the difference between him who retires the soonest, and him who stays the latest! This is seeing life in the best view, and this unwillingness to quit our friends is the most amiable motive from which we can derive the fear of death; and yet the longest enjoyment which we can hope for of this kind is of so trivial a duration, that it is to a wise man truly contemptible. Few men, I own, think in this manner; for, indeed, few men think of death till they are in its jaws. However gigantic and terrible an object this may appear when it approaches them, they are nevertheless incapable of seeing it at any distance; nay, though they have been ever so much alarmed and frightened when they have apprehended themselves in danger of dying, they are no sooner cleared from this apprehension than even the fears of it are erased from their minds. But, alas! he who escapes from death is not pardoned; he is only reprieved, and reprieved to a short day.
"Grieve, therefore, no more, my dear child, on this occasion: an event which may happen every hour; which every element, nay, almost every particle of matter that surrounds us is capable of producing, and which must and will most unavoidably reach us all at last, ought neither to occasion our surprize nor our lamentation.
"My physician having acquainted me (which I take very kindly of him) that I am in danger of leaving you all very shortly, I have determined to say a few words to you at this our parting, before my distemper, which I find grows very fast upon me, puts it out of my power.
"But I shall waste my strength too much. I intended to speak concerning my will, which, though I have settled long ago, I think proper to mention such heads of it as concern any of you, that I may have the comfort of perceiving you are all satisfied with the provision I have there made for you.
"Nephew Blifil, I leave you the heir to my whole estate, except only £500 a-year, which is to revert to you after the death of your mother, and except one other estate of £500 a-year, and the sum of £6000, which I have bestowed in the following manner:
"The estate of £500 a-year I have given to you, Mr Jones: and as I know the inconvenience which attends the want of ready money, I have added £1000 in specie. In this I know not whether I have exceeded or fallen
205
short of your expectation. Perhaps you will think I have given you too little, and the world will be as ready to condemn me for giving you too much; but the latter censure I despise; and as to the former, unless you should entertain that common error which I have often heard in my life pleaded as an excuse for a total want of charity, namely, that instead of raising gratitude by voluntary acts of bounty, we are apt to raise demands, which of all others are the most boundless and most difficult to satisfy.—Pardon me the bare mention of this; I will not suspect any such thing."
Jones flung himself at his benefactor's feet, and taking eagerly hold of his hand, assured him his goodness to him, both now and all other times, had so infinitely exceeded not only his merit but his hopes, that no words could express his sense of it. "And I assure you, sir," said he, "your present generosity hath left me no other concern than for the present melancholy occasion. Oh, my friend, my father!" Here his words choaked him, and he turned away to hide a tear which was starting from his eyes.
Allworthy then gently squeezed his hand, and proceeded thus: "I am convinced, my child, that you have much goodness, generosity, and honour, in your temper: if you will add prudence and religion to these, you must be happy; for the three former qualities, I admit, make you worthy of happiness, but they are the latter only which will put you in possession of it.
"One thousand pound I have given to you, Mr Thwackum; a sum I am convinced which greatly exceeds your desires, as well as your wants. However, you will receive it as a memorial of my friendship; and whatever superfluities may redound to you, that piety which you so rigidly maintain will instruct you how to dispose of them.
"A like sum, Mr Square, I have bequeathed to you. This, I hope, will enable you to pursue your profession with better success than hitherto. I have often observed with concern, that distress is more apt to excite contempt than commiseration, especially among men of business, with whom poverty is understood to indicate want of ability. But the little I have been able to leave you will extricate you from those difficulties with which you have formerly struggled; and then I doubt not but you will meet with sufficient prosperity to supply what a man of your philosophical temper will require.
"I find myself growing faint, so I shall refer you to my will for my disposition of the residue. My servants will there find some tokens to remember me by; and there are a few charities which, I trust, my executors

will see faithfully performed. Bless you all. I am setting out a little before you."一
Here a footman came hastily into the room, and said there was an attorney from Salisbury who had a particular message, which he said he must communicate to Mr Allworthy himself: that he seemed in a violent hurry, and protested he had so much business to do, that, if he could cut himself into four quarters, all would not be sufficient.
"Go, child," said Allworthy to Blifil, "see what the gentleman wants. I am not able to do any business now, nor can he have any with me, in which you are not at present more concerned than myself. Besides, I really am一I am incapable of seeing any one at present, or of any longer attention." He then saluted them all, saying, perhaps he should be able to see them again, but he should be now glad to compose himself a little, finding that he had too much exhausted his spirits in discourse.
Some of the company shed tears at their parting; and even the philosopher Square wiped his eyes, albeit unused to the melting mood. As to Mrs Wilkins, she dropt her pearls as fast as the Arabian trees their medicinal gums; for this was a ceremonial which that gentlewoman never omitted on a proper occasion.
After this Mr Allworthy again laid himself down on his pillow, and endeavoured to compose himself to rest.

Chapter V?
Containing matter rather natural than pleasing.
Besides grief for her master, there was another source for that briny stream which so plentifully rose above the two mountainous cheekbones of the housekeeper. She was no sooner retired, than she began to mutter to herself in the following pleasant strain: "Sure master might have made some difference, methinks, between me and the other servants. I suppose he hath left me mourning; but, i'fackins! if that be all, the devil shall wear it for him, for me. I'd have his worship know I am no beggar. I have saved five hundred pound in his service, and after all to be used in this manner.一It is a fine encouragement to servants to be honest; and to be sure, if I have taken a little something now and then, others have taken ten times as much; and now we are all put in a lump together. If so be that it be so, the legacy may go to the devil with him that gave it. No, I won't give it up neither, because that will please some folks. No, I'll buy the gayest gown I can get, and dance over the old curmudgeon's grave in it. This is my reward for taking his part so often, when all the country have cried shame of him, for breeding up his bastard in that manner; but he is going now where he must pay for all. It would have become him better to have repented of his sins on his deathbed, than to glory in them, and give away his estate out of his own family to a misbegotten child. Found in his bed, forsooth! a pretty story! ay, ay, those that hide know where to find. Lord forgive him! I warrant he hath many more bastards to answer for, if the truth was known. One comfort is, they will all be known where he is a going now.—'The servants will find some token to remember me by.' Those were the very words; I shall never forget them, if I was to live a thousand years. Ay, ay, I shall remember you for huddling me among the servants. One would have thought he might have mentioned my name as well as that of Square; but he is a gentleman forsooth, though he had not cloths on his back when he came hither first. Marry come up with such gentlemen! though he hath lived here this many years, I don't believe there is arrow
208
a servant in the house ever saw the colour of his money. The devil shall wait upon such a gentleman for me." Much more of the like kind she muttered to herself; but this taste shall suffice to the reader.
Neither Thwackum nor Square were much better satisfied with their legacies. Though they breathed not their resentment so loud, yet from the discontent which appeared in their countenances, as well as from the following dialogue, we collect that no great pleasure reigned in their minds.
About an hour after they had left the sick-room, Square met Thwack-um in the hall and accosted him thus: "Well, sir, have you heard any news of your friend since we parted from him?"一"If you mean Mr Allworthy," answered Thwackum, "I think you might rather give him the appellation of your friend; for he seems to me to have deserved that title."一"The title is as good on your side," replied Square, "for his bounty, such as it is, hath been equal to both."一"I should not have mentioned it first," cries Thwackum, "but since you begin, I must inform you I am of a different opinion. There is a wide distinction between voluntary favours and rewards. The duty I have done in his family, and the care I have taken in the education of his two boys, are services for which some men might have expected a greater return. I would not have you imagine I am therefore dissatisfied; for St Paul hath taught me to be content with the little I have. Had the modicum been less, I should have known my duty. But though the Scriptures obliges me to remain contented, it doth not enjoin me to shut my eyes to my own merit, nor restrain me from seeing when I am injured by an unjust comparison."一"Since you provoke me," returned Square, "that injury is done to me; nor did I ever imagine Mr Allworthy had held my friendship so light, as to put me in balance with one who received his wages. I know to what it is owing; it proceeds from those narrow principles which you have been so long endeavouring to infuse into him, in contempt of everything which is great and noble. The beauty and loveliness of friendship is too strong for dim eyes, nor can it be perceived by any other medium than that unerring rule of right, which you have so often endeavoured to ridicule, that you have perverted your friend's understanding."一"I wish," cries Th-wackum, in a rage, "I wish, for the sake of his soul, your damnable doctrines have not perverted his faith. It is to this I impute his present behaviour, so unbecoming a Christian. Who but an atheist could think of leaving the world without having first made up his account? without confessing his sins, and receiving that absolution which he knew he had one in the house duly authorized to give him? He will feel the want of
209
these necessaries when it is too late, when he is arrived at that place where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth. It is then he will find in what mighty stead that heathen goddess, that virtue, which you and all other deists of the age adore, will stand him. He will then summon his priest, when there is none to be found, and will lament the want of that absolution, without which no sinner can be safe."—"If it be so material," says Square, "why don't you present it him of your own accord?" "It hath no virtue," cries Thwackum, "but to those who have sufficient grace to require it. But why do I talk thus to a heathen and an unbeliever? It is you that taught him this lesson, for which you have been well rewarded in this world, as I doubt not your disciple will soon be in the other."—"I know not what you mean by reward," said Square; "but if you hint at that pitiful memorial of our friendship, which he hath thought fit to bequeath me, I despise it; and nothing but the unfortunate situation of my circumstances should prevail on me to accept it."
The physician now arrived, and began to inquire of the two disputants, how we all did above-stairs? "In a miserable way," answered Thwackum. "It is no more than I expected," cries the doctor: "but pray what symptoms have appeared since I left you?"—"No good ones, I am afraid," replied Thwackum: "after what past at our departure, I think there were little hopes." The bodily physician, perhaps, misunderstood the curer of souls; and before they came to an explanation, Mr Blifil came to them with a most melancholy countenance, and acquainted them that he brought sad news, that his mother was dead at Salisbury; that she had been seized on the road home with the gout in her head and stomach, which had carried her off in a few hours. "Good-lack-a-day!" says the doctor. "One cannot answer for events; but I wish I had been at hand, to have been called in. The gout is a distemper which it is difficult to treat; yet I have been remarkably successful in it." Thwackum and Square both condoled with Mr Blifil for the loss of his mother, which the one advised him to bear like a man, and the other like a Christian. The young gentleman said he knew very well we were all mortal, and he would endeavour to submit to his loss as well as he could. That he could not, however, help complaining a little against the peculiar severity of his fate, which brought the news of so great a calamity to him by surprize, and that at a time when he hourly expected the severest blow he was capable of feeling from the malice of fortune. He said, the present occasion would put to the test those excellent rudiments which he had learnt from Mr Th-wackum and Mr Square; and it would be entirely owing to them, if he was enabled to survive such misfortunes.
210
It was now debated whether Mr Allworthy should be informed of the death of his sister. This the doctor violently opposed; in which, I believe, the whole college would agree with him: but Mr Blifil said, he had received such positive and repeated orders from his uncle, never to keep any secret from him for fear of the disquietude which it might give him, that he durst not think of disobedience, whatever might be the consequence. He said, for his part, considering the religious and philosophic temper of his uncle, he could not agree with the doctor in his apprehensions. He was therefore resolved to communicate it to him: for if his uncle recovered (as he heartily prayed he might) he knew he would never forgive an endeavour to keep a secret of this kind from him.
The physician was forced to submit to these resolutions, which the two other learned gentlemen very highly commended. So together moved Mr Blifil and the doctor toward the sick-room; where the physician first entered, and approached the bed, in order to feel his patient's pulse, which he had no sooner done, than he declared he was much better; that the last application had succeeded to a miracle, and had brought the fever to intermit: so that, he said, there appeared now to be as little danger as he had before apprehended there were hopes.
To say the truth, Mr Allworthy's situation had never been so bad as the great caution of the doctor had represented it: but as a wise general never despises his enemy, however inferior that enemy's force may be, so neither doth a wise physician ever despise a distemper, however inconsiderable. As the former preserves the same strict discipline, places the same guards, and employs the same scouts, though the enemy be never so weak; so the latter maintains the same gravity of countenance, and shakes his head with the same significant air, let the distemper be never so trifling. And both, among many other good ones, may assign this solid reason for their conduct, that by these means the greater glory redounds to them if they gain the victory, and the less disgrace if by any unlucky accident they should happen to be conquered.
Mr Allworthy had no sooner lifted up his eyes, and thanked Heaven for these hopes of his recovery, than Mr Blifil drew near, with a very dejected aspect, and having applied his handkerchief to his eye, either to wipe away his tears, or to do as Ovid somewhere expresses himself on another occasion
Si nullus erit, tamen excute nullum,
If there be none, then wipe away that none,
211
he communicated to his uncle what the reader hath been just before acquainted with.
Allworthy received the news with concern, with patience, and with resignation. He dropt a tender tear, then composed his countenance, and at last cried, "The Lord's will be done in everything."
He now enquired for the messenger; but Blifil told him it had been impossible to detain him a moment; for he appeared by the great hurry he was in to have some business of importance on his hands; that he complained of being hurried and driven and torn out of his life, and repeated many times, that if he could divide himself into four quarters, he knew how to dispose of every one.
Allworthy then desired Blifil to take care of the funeral. He said, he would have his sister deposited in his own chapel; and as to the particulars, he left them to his own discretion, only mentioning the person whom he would have employed on this occasion.

Chapter J
Which, among other things, may serve as a comment on that saying of Aeschines, that "drunkenness shows the mind of a man, as a mirrour reflects his person."
The reader may perhaps wonder at hearing nothing of Mr Jones in the last chapter. In fact, his behaviour was so different from that of the persons there mentioned, that we chose not to confound his name with theirs.
When the good man had ended his speech, Jones was the last who deserted the room. Thence he retired to his own apartment, to give vent to his concern; but the restlessness of his mind would not suffer him to remain long there; he slipped softly therefore to Allworthy's chamberdoor, where he listened a considerable time without hearing any kind of motion within, unless a violent snoring, which at last his fears misrepresented as groans. This so alarmed him, that he could not forbear entering the room; where he found the good man in the bed, in a sweet composed sleep, and his nurse snoring in the above mentioned hearty manner, at the bed's feet. He immediately took the only method of silencing this thorough bass, whose music he feared might disturb Mr Allworthy; and then sitting down by the nurse, he remained motionless till Blifil and the doctor came in together and waked the sick man, in order that the doctor might feel his pulse, and that the other might communicate to him that piece of news, which, had Jones been apprized of it, would have had great difficulty of finding its way to Mr Allworthy's ear at such a season.
When he first heard Blifil tell his uncle this story, Jones could hardly contain the wrath which kindled in him at the other's indiscretion, especially as the doctor shook his head, and declared his unwillingness to have the matter mentioned to his patient. But as his passion did not so far deprive him of all use of his understanding, as to hide from him the consequences which any violent expression towards Blifil might have on the sick, this apprehension stilled his rage at the present; and he grew afterwards so satisfied with finding that this news had, in fact, produced
213
no mischief, that he suffered his anger to die in his own bosom, without ever mentioning it to Blifil.
The physician dined that day at Mr Allworthy's; and having after dinner visited his patient, he returned to the company, and told them, that he had now the satisfaction to say, with assurance, that his patient was out of all danger: that he had brought his fever to a perfect intermission, and doubted not by throwing in the bark to prevent its return.
This account so pleased Jones, and threw him into such immoderate excess of rapture, that he might be truly said to be drunk with joy一an intoxication which greatly forwards the effects of wine; and as he was very free too with the bottle on this occasion (for he drank many bumpers to the doctor's health, as well as to other toasts) he became very soon literally drunk.
Jones had naturally violent animal spirits: these being set on float and augmented by the spirit of wine, produced most extravagant effects. He kissed the doctor, and embraced him with the most passionate endearments; swearing that next to Mr Allworthy himself, he loved him of all men living. "Doctor," added he, "you deserve a statue to be erected to you at the public expense, for having preserved a man, who is not only the darling of all good men who know him, but a blessing to society, the glory of his country, and an honour to human nature. D一n me if I don't love him better than my own soul."
"More shame for you," cries Thwackum. "Though I think you have reason to love him, for he hath provided very well for you. And perhaps it might have been better for some folks that he had not lived to see just reason of revoking his gift."
Jones now looking on Thwackum with inconceivable disdain, answered, "And doth thy mean soul imagine that any such considerations could weigh with me? No, let the earth open and swallow her own dirt (if I had millions of acres I would say it) rather than swallow up my dear glorious friend."
Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus Tam chari capitis? 4
The doctor now interposed, and prevented the effects of a wrath which was kindling between Jones and Thwackum; after which the former gave a loose to mirth, sang two or three amorous songs, and fell
4."What modesty or measure can set bounds to our desire of so dear a friend?" The word desiderium here cannot be easily translated. It includes our desire of enjoying our friend again, and the grief which attends that desire.
214
into every frantic disorder which unbridled joy is apt to inspire; but so far was he from any disposition to quarrel, that he was ten times better humoured, if possible, than when he was sober.
To say truth, nothing is more erroneous than the common observation, that men who are ill-natured and quarrelsome when they are drunk, are very worthy persons when they are sober: for drink, in reality, doth not reverse nature, or create passions in men which did not exist in them before. It takes away the guard of reason, and consequently forces us to produce those symptoms, which many, when sober, have art enough to conceal. It heightens and inflames our passions (generally indeed that passion which is uppermost in our mind), so that the angry temper, the amorous, the generous, the good-humoured, the avaricious, and all other dispositions of men, are in their cups heightened and exposed.
And yet as no nation produces so many drunken quarrels, especially among the lower people, as England (for indeed, with them, to drink and to fight together are almost synonymous terms), I would not, methinks, have it thence concluded, that the English are the worst-natured people alive. Perhaps the love of glory only is at the bottom of this; so that the fair conclusion seems to be, that our countrymen have more of that love, and more of bravery, than any other plebeians. And this the rather, as there is seldom anything ungenerous, unfair, or ill-natured, exercised on these occasions: nay, it is common for the combatants to express goodwill for each other even at the time of the conflict; and as their drunken mirth generally ends in a battle, so do most of their battles end in friendship.
But to return to our history. Though Jones had shown no design of giving offence, yet Mr Blifil was highly offended at a behaviour which was so inconsistent with the sober and prudent reserve of his own temper. He bore it too with the greater impatience, as it appeared to him very indecent at this season; "When," as he said, "the house was a house of mourning, on the account of his dear mother; and if it had pleased Heaven to give him some prospect of Mr Allworthy's recovery, it would become them better to express the exultations of their hearts in thanksgiving, than in drunkenness and riots; which were properer methods to encrease the Divine wrath, than to avert it." Thwackum, who had swallowed more liquor than Jones, but without any ill effect on his brain, seconded the pious harangue of Blifil; but Square, for reasons which the reader may probably guess, was totally silent.
215
Wine had not so totally overpowered Jones, as to prevent his recollecting Mr Blifil's loss, the moment it was mentioned. As no person, therefore, was more ready to confess and condemn his own errors, he offered to shake Mr Blifil by the hand, and begged his pardon, saying, "His excessive joy for Mr Allworthy's recovery had driven every other thought out of his mind."
Blifil scornfully rejected his hand; and with much indignation answered, "It was little to be wondered at, if tragical spectacles made no impression on the blind; but, for his part, he had the misfortune to know who his parents were, and consequently must be affected with their loss."
Jones, who, notwithstanding his good humour, had some mixture of the irascible in his constitution, leaped hastily from his chair, and catching hold of Blifil's collar, cried out, "D一n you for a rascal, do you insult me with the misfortune of my birth?" He accompanied these words with such rough actions, that they soon got the better of Mr Blifil's peaceful temper; and a scuffle immediately ensued, which might have produced mischief, had it not been prevented by the interposition of Thwackum and the physician; for the philosophy of Square rendered him superior to all emotions, and he very calmly smoaked his pipe, as was his custom in all broils, unless when he apprehended some danger of having it broke in his mouth.
The combatants being now prevented from executing present vengeance on each other, betook themselves to the common resources of disappointed rage, and vented their wrath in threats and defiance. In this kind of conflict, Fortune, which, in the personal attack, seemed to incline to Jones, was now altogether as favourable to his enemy.
A truce, nevertheless, was at length agreed on, by the mediation of the neutral parties, and the whole company again sat down at the table; where Jones being prevailed on to ask pardon, and Blifil to give it, peace was restored, and everything seemed in statu quo.
But though the quarrel was, in all appearance, perfectly reconciled, the good humour which had been interrupted by it, was by no means restored. All merriment was now at an end, and the subsequent discourse consisted only of grave relations of matters of fact, and of as grave observations upon them; a species of conversation, in which, though there is much of dignity and instruction, there is but little entertainment. As we presume therefore to convey only this last to the reader, we shall pass by whatever was said, till the rest of the company having by degrees
216
dropped off, left only Square and the physician together; at which time the conversation was a little heightened by some comments on what had happened between the two young gentlemen; both of whom the doctor declared to be no better than scoundrels; to which appellation the philosopher, very sagaciously shaking his head, agreed.
217

Chapter A Vx
Showing the truth of many observations of Ovid, and of other more grave writers, who have proved beyond contradiction, that wine is often the forerunner of incontinency.
Jones retired from the company, in which we have seen him engaged, into the fields, where he intended to cool himself by a walk in the open air before he attended Mr Allworthy. There, whilst he renewed those meditations on his dear Sophia, which the dangerous illness of his friend and benefactor had for some time interrupted, an accident happened, which with sorrow we relate, and with sorrow doubtless will it be read; however, that historic truth to which we profess so inviolable an attachment, obliges us to communicate it to posterity.
It was now a pleasant evening in the latter end of June, when our her-oe was walking in a most delicious grove, where the gentle breezes fanning the leaves, together with the sweet trilling of a murmuring stream, and the melodious notes of nightingales, formed altogether the most enchanting harmony. In this scene, so sweetly accommodated to love, he meditated on his dear Sophia. While his wanton fancy roamed unbounded over all her beauties, and his lively imagination painted the charming maid in various ravishing forms, his warm heart melted with tenderness; and at length, throwing himself on the ground, by the side of a gently murmuring brook, he broke forth into the following ejaculation:
"O Sophia, would Heaven give thee to my arms, how blest would be my condition! Curst be that fortune which sets a distance between us. Was I but possessed of thee, one only suit of rags thy whole estate, is there a man on earth whom I would envy! How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes! But why do I mention another woman? Could I think my eyes capable of looking at any other with tenderness, these hands should tear them from my head. No, my Sophia, if cruel fortune separates us for ever, my soul shall doat on thee alone. The chastest constancy will I ever preserve to thy image. Though I should never have possession of thy
218
charming person, still shalt thou alone have possession of my thoughts, my love, my soul. Oh! my fond heart is so wrapt in that tender bosom, that the brightest beauties would for me have no charms, nor would a hermit be colder in their embraces. Sophia, Sophia alone shall be mine. What raptures are in that name! I will engrave it on every tree."
At these words he started up, and beheld一not his Sophia一no, nor a Circassian maid richly and elegantly attired for the grand Signior's seraglio. No; without a gown, in a shift that was somewhat of the coarsest, and none of the cleanest, bedewed likewise with some odoriferous effluvia, the produce of the day's labour, with a pitchfork in her hand, Molly Seagrim approached. Our hero had his penknife in his hand, which he had drawn for the before-mentioned purpose of carving on the bark; when the girl coming near him, cryed out with a smile, "You don't intend to kill me, squire, I hope!"一"Why should you think I would kill you?" answered Jones. "Nay," replied she, "after your cruel usage of me when I saw you last, killing me would, perhaps, be too great kindness for me to expect."
Here ensued a parley, which, as I do not think myself obliged to relate it, I shall omit. It is sufficient that it lasted a full quarter of an hour, at the conclusion of which they retired into the thickest part of the grove.
Some of my readers may be inclined to think this event unnatural. However, the fact is true; and perhaps may be sufficiently accounted for by suggesting, that Jones probably thought one woman better than none, and Molly as probably imagined two men to be better than one. Besides the before-mentioned motive assigned to the present behaviour of Jones, the reader will be likewise pleased to recollect in his favour, that he was not at this time perfect master of that wonderful power of reason, which so well enables grave and wise men to subdue their unruly passions, and to decline any of these prohibited amusements. Wine now had totally subdued this power in Jones. He was, indeed, in a condition, in which, if reason had interposed, though only to advise, she might have received the answer which one Cleostratus gave many years ago to a silly fellow, who asked him, if he was not ashamed to be drunk? "Are not you," said Cleostratus, "ashamed to admonish a drunken man?"一To say the truth, in a court of justice drunkenness must not be an excuse, yet in a court of conscience it is greatly so; and therefore Aristotle, who commends the laws of Pittacus, by which drunken men received double punishment for their crimes, allows there is more of policy than justice in that law. Now, if there are any transgressions pardonable from drunkenness, they are certainly such as Mr Jones was at present guilty of; on which head I
219
could pour forth a vast profusion of learning, if I imagined it would either entertain my reader, or teach him anything more than he knows already. For his sake therefore I shall keep my learning to myself, and return to my history.
It hath been observed, that Fortune seldom doth things by halves. To say truth, there is no end to her freaks whenever she is disposed to gratify or displease. No sooner had our heroe retired with his Dido, but
Speluncam Blifil dux et divinus eandem Deveniunt——
the parson and the young squire, who were taking a serious walk, arrived at the stile which leads into the grove, and the latter caught a view of the lovers just as they were sinking out of sight.
Blifil knew Jones very well, though he was at above a hundred yards' distance, and he was as positive to the sex of his companion, though not to the individual person. He started, blessed himself, and uttered a very solemn ejaculation.
Thwackum expressed some surprize at these sudden emotions, and asked the reason of them. To which Blifil answered, "He was certain he had seen a fellow and wench retire together among the bushes, which he doubted not was with some wicked purpose." As to the name of Jones, he thought proper to conceal it, and why he did so must be left to the judgment of the sagacious reader; for we never chuse to assign motives to the actions of men, when there is any possibility of our being mistaken.
The parson, who was not only strictly chaste in his own person, but a great enemy to the opposite vice in all others, fired at this information. He desired Mr Blifil to conduct him immediately to the place, which as he approached he breathed forth vengeance mixed with lamentations; nor did he refrain from casting some oblique reflections on Mr Allworthy; insinuating that the wickedness of the country was principally owing to the encouragement he had given to vice, by having exerted such kindness to a bastard, and by having mitigated that just and wholesome rigour of the law which allots a very severe punishment to loose wenches.
The way through which our hunters were to pass in pursuit of their game was so beset with briars, that it greatly obstructed their walk, and caused besides such a rustling, that Jones had sufficient warning of their arrival before they could surprize him; nay, indeed, so incapable was Th-wackum of concealing his indignation, and such vengeance did he mutter forth every step he took, that this alone must have abundantly
220
satisfied Jones that he was (to use the language of sportsmen) found sitting.
221
In which a simile in Mr Pope's period of a mile introduces as bloody a battle as can possibly be fought without the assistance of steel or cold iron.
As in the season of rutting (an uncouth phrase, by which the vulgar denote that gentle dalliance, which in the well-wooded 5 forest of Hampshire, passes between lovers of the ferine kind), if, while the lofty-crested stag meditates the amorous sport, a couple of puppies, or any other beasts of hostile note, should wander so near the temple of Venus Ferina that the fair hind should shrink from the place, touched with that somewhat, either of fear or frolic, of nicety or skittishness, with which nature hath bedecked all females, or hath at least instructed them how to put it on; lest, through the indelicacy of males, the Samean mysteries should be pryed into by unhallowed eyes: for, at the celebration of these rites, the female priestess cries out with her in Virgil (who was then, probably, hard at work on such celebration),
——Procul, o procul este, profani; Proclamat vates, totoque absistite luco.
一Far hence be souls profane, The sibyl cry'd, and from the grove abstain.一DRYDEN.
If, I say, while these sacred rites, which are in common to genus omne animantium, are in agitation between the stag and his mistress, any hostile beasts should venture too near, on the first hint given by the frighted hind, fierce and tremendous rushes forth the stag to the entrance of the thicket; there stands he centinel over his love, stamps the ground with his foot, and with his horns brandished aloft in air, proudly provokes the apprehended foe to combat.
Thus, and more terrible, when he perceived the enemy's approach, leaped forth our heroe. Many a step advanced he forwards, in order to conceal the trembling hind, and, if possible, to secure her retreat. And
5.This is an ambiguous phrase, and may mean either a forest well cloathed with wood, or well stript of it.
222
now Thwackum, having first darted some livid lightning from his fiery eyes, began to thunder forth, "Fie upon it! Fie upon it! Mr Jones. Is it possible you should be the person?"一"You see," answered Jones, "it is possible I should be here."一"And who," said Thwackum, "is that wicked slut with you?"—"If I have any wicked slut with me," cries Jones, "it is possible I shall not let you know who she is."一"I command you to tell me immediately," says Thwackum: "and I would not have you imagine, young man, that your age, though it hath somewhat abridged the purpose of tuition, hath totally taken away the authority of the master. The relation of the master and scholar is indelible; as, indeed, all other relations are; for they all derive their original from heaven. I would have you think yourself, therefore, as much obliged to obey me now, as when I taught you your first rudiments."一"I believe you would," cries Jones; "but that will not happen, unless you had the same birchen argument to convince me."一"Then I must tell you plainly," said Thwackum, "I am resolved to discover the wicked wretch."一"And I must tell you plainly," returned Jones, "I am resolved you shall not." Thwackum then offered to advance, and Jones laid hold of his arms; which Mr Blifil endeavoured to rescue, declaring, "he would not see his old master insulted."
Jones now finding himself engaged with two, thought it necessary to rid himself of one of his antagonists as soon as possible. He therefore applied to the weakest first; and, letting the parson go, he directed a blow at the young squire's breast, which luckily taking place, reduced him to measure his length on the ground.
Thwackum was so intent on the discovery, that, the moment he found himself at liberty, he stept forward directly into the fern, without any great consideration of what might in the meantime befal his friend; but he had advanced a very few paces into the thicket, before Jones, having defeated Blifil, overtook the parson, and dragged him backward by the skirt of his coat.
This parson had been a champion in his youth, and had won much honour by his fist, both at school and at the university. He had now indeed, for a great number of years, declined the practice of that noble art; yet was his courage full as strong as his faith, and his body no less strong than either. He was moreover, as the reader may perhaps have conceived, somewhat irascible in his nature. When he looked back, therefore, and saw his friend stretched out on the ground, and found himself at the same time so roughly handled by one who had formerly been only passive in all conflicts between them (a circumstance which highly aggravated the whole), his patience at length gave way; he threw himself
223
into a posture of offence; and collecting all his force, attacked Jones in the front with as much impetuosity as he had formerly attacked him in the rear.
Our heroe received the enemy's attack with the most undaunted intrepidity, and his bosom resounded with the blow. This he presently returned with no less violence, aiming likewise at the parson's breast; but he dexterously drove down the fist of Jones, so that it reached only his belly, where two pounds of beef and as many of pudding were then deposited, and whence consequently no hollow sound could proceed. Many lusty blows, much more pleasant as well as easy to have seen, than to read or describe, were given on both sides: at last a violent fall, in which Jones had thrown his knees into Thwackum's breast, so weakened the latter, that victory had been no longer dubious, had not Blifil, who had now recovered his strength, again renewed the fight, and by engaging with Jones, given the parson a moment's time to shake his ears, and to regain his breath.
And now both together attacked our heroe, whose blows did not retain that force with which they had fallen at first, so weakened was he by his combat with Thwackum; for though the pedagogue chose rather to play solos on the human instrument, and had been lately used to those only, yet he still retained enough of his antient knowledge to perform his part very well in a duet.
The victory, according to modern custom, was like to be decided by numbers, when, on a sudden, a fourth pair of fists appeared in the battle, and immediately paid their compliments to the parson; and the owner of them at the same time crying out, "Are not you ashamed, and be d一n'd to you, to fall two of you upon one?"
The battle, which was of the kind that for distinction's sake is called royal, now raged with the utmost violence during a few minutes; till Bli-fil being a second time laid sprawling by Jones, Thwackum condescended to apply for quarter to his new antagonist, who was now found to be Mr Western himself; for in the heat of the action none of the combatants had recognized him.
In fact, that honest squire, happening, in his afternoon's walk with some company, to pass through the field where the bloody battle was fought, and having concluded, from seeing three men engaged, that two of them must be on a side, he hastened from his companions, and with more gallantry than policy, espoused the cause of the weaker party. By which generous proceeding he very probably prevented Mr Jones from
224
becoming a victim to the wrath of Thwackum, and to the pious friendship which Blifil bore his old master; for, besides the disadvantage of such odds, Jones had not yet sufficiently recovered the former strength of his broken arm. This reinforcement, however, soon put an end to the action, and Jones with his ally obtained the victory.

Chapter 且
In which is seen a more moving spectacle than all the blood in the bodies of Thwackum and Blifil, and of twenty other such, is capable of producing.
The rest of Mr Western's company were now come up, being just at the instant when the action was over. These were the honest clergyman, whom we have formerly seen at Mr Western's table; Mrs Western, the aunt of Sophia; and lastly, the lovely Sophia herself.
At this time, the following was the aspect of the bloody field. In one place lay on the ground, all pale, and almost breathless, the vanquished Blifil. Near him stood the conqueror Jones, almost covered with blood, part of which was naturally his own, and part had been lately the property of the Reverend Mr Thwackum. In a third place stood the said Th-wackum, like King Porus, sullenly submitting to the conqueror. The last figure in the piece was Western the Great, most gloriously forbearing the vanquished foe.
Blifil, in whom there was little sign of life, was at first the principal object of the concern of every one, and particularly of Mrs Western, who had drawn from her pocket a bottle of hartshorn, and was herself about to apply it to his nostrils, when on a sudden the attention of the whole company was diverted from poor Blifil, whose spirit, if it had any such design, might have now taken an opportunity of stealing off to the other world, without any ceremony.
For now a more melancholy and a more lovely object lay motionless before them. This was no other than the charming Sophia herself, who, from the sight of blood, or from fear for her father, or from some other reason, had fallen down in a swoon, before any one could get to her assistance.
Mrs Western first saw her and screamed. Immediately two or three voices cried out, "Miss Western is dead." Hartshorn, water, every remedy was called for, almost at one and the same instant.
226
The reader may remember, that in our description of this grove we mentioned a murmuring brook, which brook did not come there, as such gentle streams flow through vulgar romances, with no other purpose than to murmur. No! Fortune had decreed to ennoble this little brook with a higher honour than any of those which wash the plains of Arcadia ever deserved.
Jones was rubbing Blifil's temples, for he began to fear he had given him a blow too much, when the words, Miss Western and Dead, rushed at once on his ear. He started up, left Blifil to his fate, and flew to Sophia, whom, while all the rest were running against each other, backward and forward, looking for water in the dry paths, he caught up in his arms, and then ran away with her over the field to the rivulet above mentioned; where, plunging himself into the water, he contrived to besprinkle her face, head, and neck very plentifully.
Happy was it for Sophia that the same confusion which prevented her other friends from serving her, prevented them likewise from obstructing Jones. He had carried her half ways before they knew what he was doing, and he had actually restored her to life before they reached the waterside. She stretched out her arms, opened her eyes, and cried, "Oh! heavens!" just as her father, aunt, and the parson came up.
Jones, who had hitherto held this lovely burthen in his arms, now relinquished his hold; but gave her at the same instant a tender caress, which, had her senses been then perfectly restored, could not have escaped her observation. As she expressed, therefore, no displeasure at this freedom, we suppose she was not sufficiently recovered from her swoon at the time.
This tragical scene was now converted into a sudden scene of joy. In this our heroe was certainly the principal character; for as he probably felt more ecstatic delight in having saved Sophia than she herself received from being saved, so neither were the congratulations paid to her equal to what were conferred on Jones, especially by Mr Western himself, who, after having once or twice embraced his daughter, fell to hugging and kissing Jones. He called him the preserver of Sophia, and declared there was nothing, except her, or his estate, which he would not give him; but upon recollection, he afterwards excepted his fox-hounds, the Chevalier, and Miss Slouch (for so he called his favourite mare).
All fears for Sophia being now removed, Jones became the object of the squire's consideration.—"Come, my lad," says Western, "d'off thy quoat and wash thy feace; for att in a devilish pickle, I promise thee. Come,
227
come, wash thyself, and shat go huome with me; and we'l zee to vind thee another quoat."
Jones immediately complied, threw off his coat, went down to the water, and washed both his face and bosom; for the latter was as much exposed and as bloody as the former. But though the water could clear off the blood, it could not remove the black and blue marks which Thwack-um had imprinted on both his face and breast, and which, being discerned by Sophia, drew from her a sigh and a look full of inexpressible tenderness.
Jones received this full in his eyes, and it had infinitely a stronger effect on him than all the contusions which he had received before. An effect, however, widely different; for so soft and balmy was it, that, had all his former blows been stabs, it would for some minutes have prevented his feeling their smart.
The company now moved backwards, and soon arrived where Th-wackum had got Mr Blifil again on his legs. Here we cannot suppress a pious wish, that all quarrels were to be decided by those weapons only with which Nature, knowing what is proper for us, hath supplied us; and that cold iron was to be used in digging no bowels but those of the earth. Then would war, the pastime of monarchs, be almost inoffensive, and battles between great armies might be fought at the particular desire of several ladies of quality; who, together with the kings themselves, might be actual spectators of the conflict. Then might the field be this moment well strewed with human carcasses, and the next, the dead men, or infinitely the greatest part of them, might get up, like Mr Bayes's troops, and march off either at the sound of a drum or fiddle, as should be previously agreed on.
I would avoid, if possible, treating this matter ludicrously, lest grave men and politicians, whom I know to be offended at a jest, may cry pish at it; but, in reality, might not a battle be as well decided by the greater number of broken heads, bloody noses, and black eyes, as by the greater heaps of mangled and murdered human bodies? Might not towns be contended for in the same manner? Indeed, this may be thought too detrimental a scheme to the French interest, since they would thus lose the advantage they have over other nations in the superiority of their engineers; but when I consider the gallantry and generosity of that people, I am persuaded they would never decline putting themselves upon a par with their adversary; or, as the phrase is, making themselves his match.
228
But such reformations are rather to be wished than hoped for: I shall content myself, therefore, with this short hint, and return to my narrative.
Western began now to inquire into the original rise of this quarrel. To which neither Blifil nor Jones gave any answer; but Thwackum said surlily, "I believe the cause is not far off; if you beat the bushes well you may find her."一"Find her?" replied Western: "what! have you been fighting for a wench?"一"Ask the gentleman in his waistcoat there," said Th-wackum: "he best knows." "Nay then," cries Western, "it is a wench certainly.一Ah, Tom, Tom, thou art a liquorish dog. But come, gentlemen, be all friends, and go home with me, and make final peace over a bottle." "I ask your pardon, sir," says Thwackum: "it is no such slight matter for a man of my character to be thus injuriously treated, and buffeted by a boy, only because I would have done my duty, in endeavouring to detect and bring to justice a wanton harlot; but, indeed, the principal fault lies in Mr Allworthy and yourself; for if you put the laws in execution, as you ought to do, you will soon rid the country of these vermin."
"I would as soon rid the country of foxes," cries Western. "I think we ought to encourage the recruiting those numbers which we are every day losing in the war.一But where is she? Prithee, Tom, show me." He then began to beat about, in the same language and in the same manner as if he had been beating for a hare; and at last cried out, "Soho! Puss is not far off. Here's her form, upon my soul; I believe I may cry stole away." And indeed so he might; for he had now discovered the place whence the poor girl had, at the beginning of the fray, stolen away, upon as many feet as a hare generally uses in travelling.
Sophia now desired her father to return home; saying she found herself very faint, and apprehended a relapse. The squire immediately complied with his daughter's request (for he was the fondest of parents). He earnestly endeavoured to prevail with the whole company to go and sup with him: but Blifil and Thwackum absolutely refused; the former saying, there were more reasons than he could then mention, why he must decline this honour; and the latter declaring (perhaps rightly) that it was not proper for a person of his function to be seen at any place in his present condition.
Jones was incapable of refusing the pleasure of being with his Sophia; so on he marched with Squire Western and his ladies, the parson bringing up the rear. This had, indeed, offered to tarry with his brother Th-wackum, professing his regard for the cloth would not permit him to
229
depart; but Thwackum would not accept the favour, and, with no great civility, pushed him after Mr Western.
Thus ended this bloody fray; and thus shall end the fifth book of this history.

Chapter 且
Of love.
In our last book we have been obliged to deal pretty much with the passion of love; and in our succeeding book shall be forced to handle this subject still more largely. It may not therefore in this place be improper to apply ourselves to the examination of that modern doctrine, by which certain philosophers, among many other wonderful discoveries, pretend to have found out, that there is no such passion in the human breast.
Whether these philosophers be the same with that surprising sect, who are honourably mentioned by the late Dr Swift, as having, by the mere force of genius alone, without the least assistance of any kind of learning, or even reading, discovered that profound and invaluable secret that there is no God; or whether they are not rather the same with those who some years since very much alarmed the world, by showing that there were no such things as virtue or goodness really existing in human nature, and who deduced our best actions from pride, I will not here presume to determine. In reality, I am inclined to suspect, that all these several finders of truth, are the very identical men who are by others called the finders of gold. The method used in both these searches after truth and after gold, being indeed one and the same, viz., the searching, rummaging, and examining into a nasty place; indeed, in the former instances, into the nastiest of all places, A BAD MIND.
But though in this particular, and perhaps in their success, the truthfinder and the gold-finder may very properly be compared together; yet in modesty, surely, there can be no comparison between the two; for who ever heard of a gold-finder that had the impudence or folly to assert, from the ill success of his search, that there was no such thing as gold in the world? whereas the truth-finder, having raked out that jakes, his own mind, and being there capable of tracing no ray of divinity, nor anything virtuous or good, or lovely, or loving, very fairly, honestly, and logically concludes that no such things exist in the whole creation.
232
To avoid, however, all contention, if possible, with these philosophers, if they will be called so; and to show our own disposition to accommodate matters peaceably between us, we shall here make them some concessions, which may possibly put an end to the dispute.
First, we will grant that many minds, and perhaps those of the philosophers, are entirely free from the least traces of such a passion.
Secondly, that what is commonly called love, namely, the desire of satisfying a voracious appetite with a certain quantity of delicate white human flesh, is by no means that passion for which I here contend. This is indeed more properly hunger; and as no glutton is ashamed to apply the word love to his appetite, and to say he LOVES such and such dishes; so may the lover of this kind, with equal propriety, say, he HUNGERS after such and such women.
Thirdly, I will grant, which I believe will be a most acceptable concession, that this love for which I am an advocate, though it satisfies itself in a much more delicate manner, doth nevertheless seek its own satisfaction as much as the grossest of all our appetites.
And, lastly, that this love, when it operates towards one of a different sex, is very apt, towards its complete gratification, to call in the aid of that hunger which I have mentioned above; and which it is so far from abating, that it heightens all its delights to a degree scarce imaginable by those who have never been susceptible of any other emotions than what have proceeded from appetite alone.
In return to all these concessions, I desire of the philosophers to grant, that there is in some (I believe in many) human breasts a kind and benevolent disposition, which is gratified by contributing to the happiness of others. That in this gratification alone, as in friendship, in parental and filial affection, as indeed in general philanthropy, there is a great and exquisite delight. That if we will not call such disposition love, we have no name for it. That though the pleasures arising from such pure love may be heightened and sweetened by the assistance of amorous desires, yet the former can subsist alone, nor are they destroyed by the intervention of the latter. Lastly, that esteem and gratitude are the proper motives to love, as youth and beauty are to desire, and, therefore, though such desire may naturally cease, when age or sickness overtakes its object; yet these can have no effect on love, nor ever shake or remove, from a good mind, that sensation or passion which hath gratitude and esteem for its basis.
233
To deny the existence of a passion of which we often see manifest instances, seems to be very strange and absurd; and can indeed proceed only from that self-admonition which we have mentioned above: but how unfair is this! Doth the man who recognizes in his own heart no traces of avarice or ambition, conclude, therefore, that there are no such passions in human nature? Why will we not modestly observe the same rule in judging of the good, as well as the evil of others? Or why, in any case, will we, as Shakespear phrases it, "put the world in our own person?"
Predominant vanity is, I am afraid, too much concerned here. This is one instance of that adulation which we bestow on our own minds, and this almost universally. For there is scarce any man, how much soever he may despise the character of a flatterer, but will condescend in the meanest manner to flatter himself.
To those therefore I apply for the truth of the above observations, whose own minds can bear testimony to what I have advanced.
Examine your heart, my good reader, and resolve whether you do believe these matters with me. If you do, you may now proceed to their exemplification in the following pages: if you do not, you have, I assure you, already read more than you have understood; and it would be wiser to pursue your business, or your pleasures (such as they are), than to throw away any more of your time in reading what you can neither taste nor comprehend. To treat of the effects of love to you, must be as absurd as to discourse on colours to a man born blind; since possibly your idea of love may be as absurd as that which we are told such blind man once entertained of the colour scarlet; that colour seemed to him to be very much like the sound of a trumpet: and love probably may, in your opinion, very greatly resemble a dish of soup, or a surloin of roastbeef.

Chapter
The character of Mrs Western. Her great learning and knowledge of the world, and an instance of the deep penetration which she derived from those advantages.
The reader hath seen Mr Western, his sister, and daughter, with young Jones, and the parson, going together to Mr Western's house, where the greater part of the company spent the evening with much joy and festivity. Sophia was indeed the only grave person; for as to Jones, though love had now gotten entire possession of his heart, yet the pleasing reflection on Mr Allworthy's recovery, and the presence of his mistress, joined to some tender looks which she now and then could not refrain from giving him, so elevated our heroe, that he joined the mirth of the other three, who were perhaps as good-humoured people as any in the world.
Sophia retained the same gravity of countenance the next morning at breakfast; whence she retired likewise earlier than usual, leaving her father and aunt together. The squire took no notice of this change in his daughter's disposition. To say the truth, though he was somewhat of a politician, and had been twice a candidate in the country interest at an election, he was a man of no great observation. His sister was a lady of a different turn. She had lived about the court, and had seen the world. Hence she had acquired all that knowledge which the said world usually communicates; and was a perfect mistress of manners, customs, ceremonies, and fashions. Nor did her erudition stop here. She had considerably improved her mind by study; she had not only read all the modern plays, operas, oratorios, poems, and romances一in all which she was a critic; but had gone through Rapin's History of England, Eachard's Roman History, and many French Memoires pour servir a t'Histoire: to these she had added most of the political pamphlets and journals published within the last twenty years. From which she had attained a very competent skill in politics, and could discourse very learnedly on the affairs of Europe. She was, moreover, excellently well skilled in the doctrine of
235
amour, and knew better than anybody who and who were together; a knowledge which she the more easily attained, as her pursuit of it was never diverted by any affairs of her own; for either she had no inclinations, or they had never been solicited; which last is indeed very probable; for her masculine person, which was near six foot high, added to her manner and learning, possibly prevented the other sex from regarding her, notwithstanding her petticoats, in the light of a woman. However, as she had considered the matter scientifically, she perfectly well knew, though she had never practised them, all the arts which fine ladies use when they desire to give encouragement, or to conceal liking, with all the long appendage of smiles, ogles, glances, &amp;c., as they are at present practised in the beau-monde. To sum the whole, no species of disguise or affectation had escaped her notice; but as to the plain simple workings of honest nature, as she had never seen any such, she could know but little of them.
By means of this wonderful sagacity, Mrs Western had now, as she thought, made a discovery of something in the mind of Sophia. The first hint of this she took from the behaviour of the young lady in the field of battle; and the suspicion which she then conceived, was greatly corroborated by some observations which she had made that evening and the next morning. However, being greatly cautious to avoid being found in a mistake, she carried the secret a whole fortnight in her bosom, giving only some oblique hints, by simpering, winks, nods, and now and then dropping an obscure word, which indeed sufficiently alarmed Sophia, but did not at all affect her brother.
Being at length, however, thoroughly satisfied of the truth of her observation, she took an opportunity, one morning, when she was alone with her brother, to interrupt one of his whistles in the following manner:—
"Pray, brother, have you not observed something very extraordinary in my niece lately?"—"No, not I," answered Western; "is anything the matter with the girl?"—"I think there is," replied she; "and something of much consequence too."一"Why, she doth not complain of anything," cries Western; "and she hath had the small-pox."一"Brother," returned she, "girls are liable to other distempers besides the small-pox, and sometimes possibly to much worse." Here Western interrupted her with much earnestness, and begged her, if anything ailed his daughter, to acquaint him immediately; adding, "she knew he loved her more than his own soul, and that he would send to the world's end for the best physician to her." "Nay, nay," answered she, smiling, "the distemper is not so terrible;
236
but I believe, brother, you are convinced I know the world, and I promise you I was never more deceived in my life, if my niece be not most desperately in love."一"How! in love!" cries Western, in a passion; "in love, without acquainting me! I'll disinherit her; I'll turn her out of doors, stark naked, without a farthing. Is all my kindness vor 'ur, and vondness o'ur come to this, to fall in love without asking me leave?"一"But you will not," answered Mrs Western, "turn this daughter, whom you love better than your own soul, out of doors, before you know whether you shall approve her choice. Suppose she should have fixed on the very person whom you yourself would wish, I hope you would not be angry then?"一"No, no," cries Western, "that would make a difference. If she marries the man I would ha' her, she may love whom she pleases, I shan't trouble my head about that." "That is spoken," answered the sister, "like a sensible man; but I believe the very person she hath chosen would be the very person you would choose for her. I will disclaim all knowledge of the world, if it is not so; and I believe, brother, you will allow I have some."一"Why, lookee, sister," said Western, "I do believe you have as much as any woman; and to be sure those are women's matters. You know I don't love to hear you talk about politics; they belong to us, and petticoats should not meddle: but come, who is the man?"一"Marry!" said she, "you may find him out yourself if you please. You, who are so great a politician, can be at no great loss. The judgment which can penetrate into the cabinets of princes, and discover the secret springs which move the great state wheels in all the political machines of Europe, must surely, with very little difficulty, find out what passes in the rude uninformed mind of a girl."—"Sister," cries the squire, "I have often warn'd you not to talk the court gibberish to me. I tell you, I don't understand the lingo: but I can read a journal, or the London Evening Post. Perhaps, indeed, there may be now and tan a verse which I can't make much of, because half the letters are left out; yet I know very well what is meant by that, and that our affairs don't go so well as they should do, because of bribery and corruption."一"I pity your country ignorance from my heart," cries the lady.一"Do you?" answered Western; "and I pity your town learning; I had rather be anything than a courtier, and a Presbyterian, and a Hanoverian too, as some people, I believe, are."一"If you mean me," answered she, "you know I am a woman, brother; and it signifies nothing what I am. Besides一"一"I do know you are a woman," cries the squire, "and it's well for thee that art one; if hadst been a man, I promise thee I had lent thee a flick long ago."一"Ay, there," said she, "in that flick lies all your fancied superiority. Your bodies, and not your brains, are
237
stronger than ours. Believe me, it is well for you that you are able to beat us; or, such is the superiority of our understanding, we should make all of you what the brave, and wise, and witty, and polite are already一our slaves."—"I am glad I know your mind," answered the squire. "But we'll talk more of this matter another time. At present, do tell me what man is it you mean about my daughter?"一"Hold a moment," said she, "while I digest that sovereign contempt I have for your sex; or else I ought to be angry too with you. There一I have made a shift to gulp it down. And now, good politic sir, what think you of Mr Blifil? Did she not faint away on seeing him lie breathless on the ground? Did she not, after he was recovered, turn pale again the moment we came up to that part of the field where he stood? And pray what else should be the occasion of all her melancholy that night at supper, the next morning, and indeed ever since?"一"'Fore George!" cries the squire, "now you mind me on't, I remember it all. It is certainly so, and I am glad on't with all my heart. I knew Sophy was a good girl, and would not fall in love to make me angry. I was never more rejoiced in my life; for nothing can lie so handy together as our two estates. I had this matter in my head some time ago: for certainly the two estates are in a manner joined together in matrimony already, and it would be a thousand pities to part them. It is true, indeed, there be larger estates in the kingdom, but not in this county, and I had rather bate something, than marry my daughter among strangers and foreigners. Besides, most o' zuch great estates be in the hands of lords, and I heate the very name of themmun. Well but, sister, what would you advise me to do; for I tell you women know these matters better than we do?"一"Oh, your humble servant, sir," answered the lady: "we are obliged to you for allowing us a capacity in anything. Since you are pleased, then, most politic sir, to ask my advice, I think you may propose the match to Allworthy yourself. There is no indecorum in the proposal's coming from the parent of either side. King Alcinous, in Mr Pope's Odyssey, offers his daughter to Ulysses. I need not caution so politic a person not to say that your daughter is in love; that would indeed be against all rules."—"Well," said the squire, "I will propose it; but I shall certainly lend un a flick, if he should refuse me." "Fear not," cries Mrs Western; "the match is too advantageous to be refused." "I don't know that," answered the squire: "Allworthy is a queer b一ch, and money hath no effect o'un." "Brother," said the lady, "your politics astonish me. Are you really to be imposed on by professions? Do you think Mr Allworthy hath more contempt for money than other men because he professes more? Such credulity would better become one of us weak
238
women, than that wise sex which heaven hath formed for politicians. Indeed, brother, you would make a fine plenipo to negotiate with the French. They would soon persuade you, that they take towns out of mere defensive principles." "Sister," answered the squire, with much scorn, "let your friends at court answer for the towns taken; as you are a woman, I shall lay no blame upon you; for I suppose they are wiser than to trust women with secrets." He accompanied this with so sarcastical a laugh, that Mrs Western could bear no longer. She had been all this time fretted in a tender part (for she was indeed very deeply skilled in these matters, and very violent in them), and therefore, burst forth in a rage, declared her brother to be both a clown and a blockhead, and that she would stay no longer in his house.
The squire, though perhaps he had never read Machiavel, was, however, in many points, a perfect politician. He strongly held all those wise tenets, which are so well inculcated in that Politico-Peripatetic school of Exchange-alley. He knew the just value and only use of money, viz., to lay it up. He was likewise well skilled in the exact value of reversions, expectations, &amp;c., and had often considered the amount of his sister's fortune, and the chance which he or his posterity had of inheriting it. This he was infinitely too wise to sacrifice to a trifling resentment. When he found, therefore, he had carried matters too far, he began to think of reconciling them; which was no very difficult task, as the lady had great affection for her brother, and still greater for her niece; and though too susceptible of an affront offered to her skill in politics, on which she much valued herself, was a woman of a very extraordinary good and sweet disposition.
Having first, therefore, laid violent hands on the horses, for whose escape from the stable no place but the window was left open, he next applied himself to his sister; softened and soothed her, by unsaying all he had said, and by assertions directly contrary to those which had incensed her. Lastly, he summoned the eloquence of Sophia to his assistance, who, besides a most graceful and winning address, had the advantage of being heard with great favour and partiality by her aunt.
The result of the whole was a kind smile from Mrs Western, who said, "Brother, you are absolutely a perfect Croat; but as those have their use in the army of the empress queen, so you likewise have some good in you. I will therefore once more sign a treaty of peace with you, and see that you do not infringe it on your side; at least, as you are so excellent a politician, I may expect you will keep your leagues, like the French, till your interest calls upon you to break them."

Chapter U
Containing two defiances to the critics.
The squire having settled matters with his sister, as we have seen in the last chapter, was so greatly impatient to communicate the proposal to Allworthy, that Mrs Western had the utmost difficulty to prevent him from visiting that gentleman in his sickness, for this purpose.
Mr Allworthy had been engaged to dine with Mr Western at the time when he was taken ill. He was therefore no sooner discharged out of the custody of physic, but he thought (as was usual with him on all occasions, both the highest and the lowest) of fulfilling his engagement.
In the interval between the time of the dialogue in the last chapter, and this day of public entertainment, Sophia had, from certain obscure hints thrown out by her aunt, collected some apprehension that the sagacious lady suspected her passion for Jones. She now resolved to take this opportunity of wiping out all such suspicion, and for that purpose to put an entire constraint on her behaviour.
First, she endeavoured to conceal a throbbing melancholy heart with the utmost sprightliness in her countenance, and the highest gaiety in her manner. Secondly, she addressed her whole discourse to Mr Blifil, and took not the least notice of poor Jones the whole day.
The squire was so delighted with this conduct of his daughter, that he scarce eat any dinner, and spent almost his whole time in watching opportunities of conveying signs of his approbation by winks and nods to his sister; who was not at first altogether so pleased with what she saw as was her brother.
In short, Sophia so greatly overacted her part, that her aunt was at first staggered, and began to suspect some affectation in her niece; but as she was herself a woman of great art, so she soon attributed this to extreme art in Sophia. She remembered the many hints she had given her niece concerning her being in love, and imagined the young lady had taken this way to rally her out of her opinion, by an overacted civility: a notion
240
that was greatly corroborated by the excessive gaiety with which the whole was accompanied. We cannot here avoid remarking, that this conjecture would have been better founded had Sophia lived ten years in the air of Grosvenor Square, where young ladies do learn a wonderful knack of rallying and playing with that passion, which is a mighty serious thing in woods and groves an hundred miles distant from London.
To say the truth, in discovering the deceit of others, it matters much that our own art be wound up, if I may use the expression, in the same key with theirs: for very artful men sometimes miscarry by fancying others wiser, or, in other words, greater knaves, than they really are. As this observation is pretty deep, I will illustrate it by the following short story. Three countrymen were pursuing a Wiltshire thief through Brentford. The simplest of them seeing "The Wiltshire House," written under a sign, advised his companions to enter it, for there most probably they would find their countryman. The second, who was wiser, laughed at this simplicity; but the third, who was wiser still, answered, "Let us go in, however, for he may think we should not suspect him of going amongst his own countrymen." They accordingly went in and searched the house, and by that means missed overtaking the thief, who was at that time but a little way before them; and who, as they all knew, but had never once reflected, could not read.
The reader will pardon a digression in which so invaluable a secret is communicated, since every gamester will agree how necessary it is to know exactly the play of another, in order to countermine him. This will, moreover, afford a reason why the wiser man, as is often seen, is the bubble of the weaker, and why many simple and innocent characters are so generally misunderstood and misrepresented; but what is most material, this will account for the deceit which Sophia put on her politic aunt.
Dinner being ended, and the company retired into the garden, Mr Western, who was thoroughly convinced of the certainty of what his sister had told him, took Mr Allworthy aside, and very bluntly proposed a match between Sophia and young Mr Blifil.
Mr Allworthy was not one of those men whose hearts flutter at any unexpected and sudden tidings of worldly profit. His mind was, indeed, tempered with that philosophy which becomes a man and a Christian. He affected no absolute superiority to all pleasure and pain, to all joy and grief; but was not at the same time to be discomposed and ruffled by every accidental blast, by every smile or frown of fortune. He received, therefore, Mr Western's proposal without any visible emotion, or
241
without any alteration of countenance. He said the alliance was such as he sincerely wished; then launched forth into a very just encomium on the young lady's merit; acknowledged the offer to be advantageous in point of fortune; and after thanking Mr Western for the good opinion he had professed of his nephew, concluded, that if the young people liked each other, he should be very desirous to complete the affair.
Western was a little disappointed at Mr Allworthy's answer, which was not so warm as he expected. He treated the doubt whether the young people might like one another with great contempt, saying, "That parents were the best judges of proper matches for their children: that for his part he should insist on the most resigned obedience from his daughter: and if any young fellow could refuse such a bed-fellow, he was his humble servant, and hoped there was no harm done."
Allworthy endeavoured to soften this resentment by many eulogiums on Sophia, declaring he had no doubt but that Mr Blifil would very gladly receive the offer; but all was ineffectual; he could obtain no other answer from the squire but一"I say no more一I humbly hope there's no harm done一that's all." Which words he repeated at least a hundred times before they parted.
Allworthy was too well acquainted with his neighbour to be offended at this behaviour; and though he was so averse to the rigour which some parents exercise on their children in the article of marriage, that he had resolved never to force his nephew's inclinations, he was nevertheless much pleased with the prospect of this union; for the whole country resounded the praises of Sophia, and he had himself greatly admired the uncommon endowments of both her mind and person.
To which I believe we may add, the consideration of her vast fortune, which, though he was too sober to be intoxicated with it, he was too sensible to despise.
And here, in defiance of all the barking critics in the world, I must and will introduce a digression concerning true wisdom, of which Mr Allworthy was in reality as great a pattern as he was of goodness.
True wisdom then, notwithstanding all which Mr Hogarth's poor poet may have writ against riches, and in spite of all which any rich well-fed divine may have preached against pleasure, consists not in the contempt of either of these. A man may have as much wisdom in the possession of an affluent fortune, as any beggar in the streets; or may enjoy a handsome wife or a hearty friend, and still remain as wise as any sour popish
242
recluse, who buries all his social faculties, and starves his belly while he well lashes his back.
To say truth, the wisest man is the likeliest to possess all worldly blessings in an eminent degree; for as that moderation which wisdom prescribes is the surest way to useful wealth, so can it alone qualify us to taste many pleasures. The wise man gratifies every appetite and every passion, while the fool sacrifices all the rest to pall and satiate one.
It may be objected, that very wise men have been notoriously avaricious. I answer, Not wise in that instance. It may likewise be said, That the wisest men have been in their youth immoderately fond of pleasure. I answer, They were not wise then.
Wisdom, in short, whose lessons have been represented as so hard to learn by those who never were at her school, only teaches us to extend a simple maxim universally known and followed even in the lowest life, a little farther than that life carries it. And this is, not to buy at too dear a price.
Now, whoever takes this maxim abroad with him into the grand market of the world, and constantly applies it to honours, to riches, to pleasures, and to every other commodity which that market affords, is, I will venture to affirm, a wise man, and must be so acknowledged in the worldly sense of the word; for he makes the best of bargains, since in reality he purchases everything at the price only of a little trouble, and carries home all the good things I have mentioned, while he keeps his health, his innocence, and his reputation, the common prices which are paid for them by others, entire and to himself.
From this moderation, likewise, he learns two other lessons, which complete his character. First, never to be intoxicated when he hath made the best bargain, nor dejected when the market is empty, or when its commodities are too dear for his purchase.
But I must remember on what subject I am writing, and not trespass too far on the patience of a good-natured critic. Here, therefore, I put an end to the chapter.
243
Containing sundry curious matters.
As soon as Mr Allworthy returned home, he took Mr Blifil apart, and after some preface, communicated to him the proposal which had been made by Mr Western, and at the same time informed him how agreeable this match would be to himself.
The charms of Sophia had not made the least impression on Blifil; not that his heart was pre-engaged; neither was he totally insensible of beauty, or had any aversion to women; but his appetites were by nature so moderate, that he was able, by philosophy, or by study, or by some other method, easily to subdue them: and as to that passion which we have treated of in the first chapter of this book, he had not the least tincture of it in his whole composition.
But though he was so entirely free from that mixed passion, of which we there treated, and of which the virtues and beauty of Sophia formed so notable an object; yet was he altogether as well furnished with some other passions, that promised themselves very full gratification in the young lady's fortune. Such were avarice and ambition, which divided the dominion of his mind between them. He had more than once considered the possession of this fortune as a very desirable thing, and had entertained some distant views concerning it; but his own youth, and that of the young lady, and indeed principally a reflection that Mr Western might marry again, and have more children, had restrained him from too hasty or eager a pursuit.
This last and most material objection was now in great measure removed, as the proposal came from Mr Western himself. Blifil, therefore, after a very short hesitation, answered Mr Allworthy, that matrimony was a subject on which he had not yet thought; but that he was so sensible of his friendly and fatherly care, that he should in all things submit himself to his pleasure.
244
Allworthy was naturally a man of spirit, and his present gravity arose from true wisdom and philosophy, not from any original phlegm in his disposition; for he had possessed much fire in his youth, and had married a beautiful woman for love. He was not therefore greatly pleased with this cold answer of his nephew; nor could he help launching forth into the praises of Sophia, and expressing some wonder that the heart of a young man could be impregnable to the force of such charms, unless it was guarded by some prior affection.
Blifil assured him he had no such guard; and then proceeded to discourse so wisely and religiously on love and marriage, that he would have stopt the mouth of a parent much less devoutly inclined than was his uncle. In the end, the good man was satisfied that his nephew, far from having any objections to Sophia, had that esteem for her, which in sober and virtuous minds is the sure foundation of friendship and love. And as he doubted not but the lover would, in a little time, become altogether as agreeable to his mistress, he foresaw great happiness arising to all parties by so proper and desirable an union. With Mr Blifil's consent therefore he wrote the next morning to Mr Western, acquainting him that his nephew had very thankfully and gladly received the proposal, and would be ready to wait on the young lady, whenever she should be pleased to accept his visit.
Western was much pleased with this letter, and immediately returned an answer; in which, without having mentioned a word to his daughter, he appointed that very afternoon for opening the scene of courtship.
As soon as he had dispatched this messenger, he went in quest of his sister, whom he found reading and expounding the Gazette to parson Supple. To this exposition he was obliged to attend near a quarter of an hour, though with great violence to his natural impetuosity, before he was suffered to speak. At length, however, he found an opportunity of acquainting the lady, that he had business of great consequence to impart to her; to which she answered, "Brother, I am entirely at your service. Things look so well in the north, that I was never in a better humour."
The parson then withdrawing, Western acquainted her with all which had passed, and desired her to communicate the affair to Sophia, which she readily and chearfully undertook; though perhaps her brother was a little obliged to that agreeable northern aspect which had so delighted her, that he heard no comment on his proceedings; for they were certainly somewhat too hasty and violent.

Chapter U
In which is related what passed between Sophia and her aunt.
Sophia was in her chamber, reading, when her aunt came in. The moment she saw Mrs Western, she shut the book with so much eagerness, that the good lady could not forbear asking her, What book that was which she seemed so much afraid of showing? "Upon my word, madam," answered Sophia, "it is a book which I am neither ashamed nor afraid to own I have read. It is the production of a young lady of fashion, whose good understanding, I think, doth honour to her sex, and whose good heart is an honour to human nature." Mrs Western then took up the book, and immediately after threw it down, saying—"Yes, the author is of a very good family; but she is not much among people one knows. I have never read it; for the best judges say, there is not much in it."—"I dare not, madam, set up my own opinion," says Sophia, "against the best judges, but there appears to me a great deal of human nature in it; and in many parts so much true tenderness and delicacy, that it hath cost me many a tear."—"Ay, and do you love to cry then?" says the aunt. "I love a tender sensation," answered the niece, "and would pay the price of a tear for it at any time."—"Well, but show me," said the aunt, "what was you reading when I came in; there was something very tender in that, I believe, and very loving too. You blush, my dear Sophia. Ah! child, you should read books which would teach you a little hypocrisy, which would instruct you how to hide your thoughts a little better."—"I hope, madam," answered Sophia, "I have no thoughts which I ought to be ashamed of discovering."—"Ashamed! no," cries the aunt, "I don't think you have any thoughts which you ought to be ashamed of; and yet, child, you blushed just now when I mentioned the word loving. Dear Sophy, be assured you have not one thought which I am not well acquainted with; as well, child, as the French are with our motions, long before we put them in execution. Did you think, child, because you have been able to impose upon your father, that you could impose upon me? Do you imagine I did not know the reason of your overacting all that
246
friendship for Mr Blifil yesterday? I have seen a little too much of the world, to be so deceived. Nay, nay, do not blush again. I tell you it is a passion you need not be ashamed of. It is a passion I myself approve, and have already brought your father into the approbation of it. Indeed, I solely consider your inclination; for I would always have that gratified, if possible, though one may sacrifice higher prospects. Come, I have news which will delight your very soul. Make me your confident, and I will undertake you shall be happy to the very extent of your wishes." "La, madam," says Sophia, looking more foolishly than ever she did in her life, "I know not what to say一why, madam, should you suspect?"一"Nay, no dishonesty," returned Mrs Western. "Consider, you are speaking to one of your own sex, to an aunt, and I hope you are convinced you speak to a friend. Consider, you are only revealing to me what I know already, and what I plainly saw yesterday, through that most artful of all disguises, which you had put on, and which must have deceived any one who had not perfectly known the world. Lastly, consider it is a passion which I highly approve." "La, madam," says Sophia, "you come upon one so unawares, and on a sudden. To be sure, madam, I am not blind一and certainly, if it be a fault to see all human perfections assembled together一but is it possible my father and you, madam, can see with my eyes?" "I tell you," answered the aunt, "we do entirely approve; and this very afternoon your father hath appointed for you to receive your lover." "My father, this afternoon!" cries Sophia, with the blood starting from her face.一"Yes, child," said the aunt, "this afternoon. You know the impetuosity of my brother's temper. I acquainted him with the passion which I first discovered in you that evening when you fainted away in the field. I saw it in your fainting. I saw it immediately upon your recovery. I saw it that evening at supper, and the next morning at breakfast (you know, child, I have seen the world). Well, I no sooner acquainted my brother, but he immediately wanted to propose it to Allworthy. He proposed it yesterday, Allworthy consented (as to be sure he must with joy), and this afternoon, I tell you, you are to put on all your best airs." "This afternoon!" cries Sophia. "Dear aunt, you frighten me out of my senses." "O, my dear," said the aunt, "you will soon come to yourself again; for he is a charming young fellow, that's the truth on't." "Nay, I will own," says Sophia, "I know none with such perfections. So brave, and yet so gentle; so witty, yet so inoffensive; so humane, so civil, so genteel, so handsome! What signifies his being base born, when compared with such qualifications as these?" "Base born? What do you mean?" said the aunt, "Mr Blifil base born!" Sophia turned instantly pale
247
at this name, and faintly repeated it. Upon which the aunt cried, "Mr Bli-fil一ay, Mr Blifil, of whom else have we been talking?" "Good heavens," answered Sophia, ready to sink, "of Mr Jones, I thought; I am sure I know no other who deserves一" "I protest," cries the aunt, "you frighten me in your turn. Is it Mr Jones, and not Mr Blifil, who is the object of your affection?" "Mr Blifil!" repeated Sophia. "Sure it is impossible you can be in earnest; if you are, I am the most miserable woman alive." Mrs Western now stood a few moments silent, while sparks of fiery rage flashed from her eyes. At length, collecting all her force of voice, she thundered forth in the following articulate sounds:
"And is it possible you can think of disgracing your family by allying yourself to a bastard? Can the blood of the Westerns submit to such contamination? If you have not sense sufficient to restrain such monstrous inclinations, I thought the pride of our family would have prevented you from giving the least encouragement to so base an affection; much less did I imagine you would ever have had the assurance to own it to my face."
"Madam," answered Sophia, trembling, "what I have said you have extorted from me. I do not remember to have ever mentioned the name of Mr Jones with approbation to any one before; nor should I now had I not conceived he had your approbation. Whatever were my thoughts of that poor, unhappy young man, I intended to have carried them with me to my grave一to that grave where only now, I find, I am to seek repose." Here she sunk down in her chair, drowned in her tears, and, in all the moving silence of unutterable grief, presented a spectacle which must have affected almost the hardest heart.
All this tender sorrow, however, raised no compassion in her aunt. On the contrary, she now fell into the most violent rage.一"And I would rather," she cried, in a most vehement voice, "follow you to your grave, than I would see you disgrace yourself and your family by such a match. O Heavens! could I have ever suspected that I should live to hear a niece of mine declare a passion for such a fellow? You are the first一yes, Miss Western, you are the first of your name who ever entertained so grovelling a thought. A family so noted for the prudence of its women"一here she ran on a full quarter of an hour, till, having exhausted her breath rather than her rage, she concluded with threatening to go immediately and acquaint her brother.
Sophia then threw herself at her feet, and laying hold of her hands, begged her with tears to conceal what she had drawn from her; urging
248
the violence of her father's temper, and protesting that no inclinations of hers should ever prevail with her to do anything which might offend him.
Mrs Western stood a moment looking at her, and then, having recollected herself, said, "That on one consideration only she would keep the secret from her brother; and this was, that Sophia should promise to entertain Mr Blifil that very afternoon as her lover, and to regard him as the person who was to be her husband."
Poor Sophia was too much in her aunt's power to deny her anything positively; she was obliged to promise that she would see Mr Blifil, and be as civil to him as possible; but begged her aunt that the match might not be hurried on. She said, "Mr Blifil was by no means agreeable to her, and she hoped her father would be prevailed on not to make her the most wretched of women."
Mrs Western assured her, "That the match was entirely agreed upon, and that nothing could or should prevent it. I must own," said she, "I looked on it as on a matter of indifference; nay, perhaps, had some scruples about it before, which were actually got over by my thinking it highly agreeable to your own inclinations; but now I regard it as the most eligible thing in the world: nor shall there be, if I can prevent it, a moment of time lost on the occasion."
Sophia replied, "Delay at least, madam, I may expect from both your goodness and my father's. Surely you will give me time to endeavour to get the better of so strong a disinclination as I have at present to this person."
The aunt answered, "She knew too much of the world to be so deceived; that as she was sensible another man had her affections, she should persuade Mr Western to hasten the match as much as possible. It would be bad politics, indeed," added she, "to protract a siege when the enemy's army is at hand, and in danger of relieving it. No, no, Sophy," said she, "as I am convinced you have a violent passion which you can never satisfy with honour, I will do all I can to put your honour out of the care of your family: for when you are married those matters will belong only to the consideration of your husband. I hope, child, you will always have prudence enough to act as becomes you; but if you should not, marriage hath saved many a woman from ruin."
Sophia well understood what her aunt meant; but did not think proper to make her an answer. However, she took a resolution to see Mr Blifil, and to behave to him as civilly as she could, for on that condition only
249
she obtained a promise from her aunt to keep secret the liking which her ill fortune, rather than any scheme of Mrs Western, had unhappily drawn from her.
250

Containing a dialogue between Sophia and Mrs Honour, which may a little relieve those tender affections which the foregoing scene may have raised in the mind of a good-natured reader.
Mrs Western having obtained that promise from her niece which we have seen in the last chapter, withdrew; and presently after arrived Mrs Honour. She was at work in a neighbouring apartment, and had been summoned to the keyhole by some vociferation in the preceding dialogue, where she had continued during the remaining part of it. At her entry into the room, she found Sophia standing motionless, with the tears trickling from her eyes. Upon which she immediately ordered a proper quantity of tears into her own eyes, and then began, "O Gemini, my dear lady, what is the matter?"一"Nothing," cries Sophia. "Nothing! O dear Madam!" answers Honour, "you must not tell me that, when your ladyship is in this taking, and when there hath been such a preamble between your ladyship and Madam Western."一"Don't teaze me," cries Sophia; "I tell you nothing is the matter. Good heavens! why was I born?"一"Nay, madam," says Mrs Honour, "you shall never persuade me that your la'ship can lament yourself so for nothing. To be sure I am but a servant; but to be sure I have been always faithful to your la'ship, and to be sure I would serve your la'ship with my life."一"My dear Honour," says Sophia, "'tis not in thy power to be of any service to me. I am irretrievably undone."一"Heaven forbid!" answered the waiting-woman; "but if I can't be of any service to you, pray tell me, madam一it will be some comfort to me to know一pray, dear ma'am, tell me what's the matter."一"My father," cries Sophia, "is going to marry me to a man I both despise and hate."一"O dear, ma'am," answered the other, "who is this wicked man? for to be sure he is very bad, or your la'ship would not despise him."一"His name is poison to my tongue," replied Sophia: "thou wilt know it too soon." Indeed, to confess the truth, she knew it already, and therefore was not very inquisitive as to that point. She then proceeded thus: "I don't pretend to give your la'ship advice, whereof your
251
la'ship knows much better than I can pretend to, being but a servant; but, i-fackins! no father in England should marry me against my consent. And, to be sure, the 'squire is so good, that if he did but know your la'ship despises and hates the young man, to be sure he would not desire you to marry him. And if your la'ship would but give me leave to tell my master so. To be sure, it would be more properer to come from your own mouth; but as your la'ship doth not care to foul your tongue with his nasty name一"一"You are mistaken, Honour," says Sophia; "my father was determined before he ever thought fit to mention it to me."一"More shame for him," cries Honour: "you are to go to bed to him, and not master: and thof a man may be a very proper man, yet every woman mayn't think him handsome alike. I am sure my master would never act in this manner of his own head. I wish some people would trouble themselves only with what belongs to them; they would not, I believe, like to be served so, if it was their own case; for though I am a maid, I can easily believe as how all men are not equally agreeable. And what signifies your la'ship having so great a fortune, if you can't please yourself with the man you think most handsomest? Well, I say nothing; but to be sure it is a pity some folks had not been better born; nay, as for that matter, I should not mind it myself; but then there is not so much money; and what of that? your la'ship hath money enough for both; and where can your la'ship bestow your fortune better? for to be sure every one must allow that he is the most handsomest, charmingest, finest, tallest, properest man in the world."一"What do you mean by running on in this manner to me?" cries Sophia, with a very grave countenance. "Have I ever given any encouragement for these liberties?"一"Nay, ma'am, I ask pardon; I meant no harm," answered she; "but to be sure the poor gentleman hath run in my head ever since I saw him this morning. To be sure, if your la'ship had but seen him just now, you must have pitied him. Poor gentleman! I wishes some misfortune hath not happened to him; for he hath been walking about with his arms across, and looking so melancholy, all this morning: I vow and protest it made me almost cry to see him."一"To see whom?" says Sophia. "Poor Mr Jones," answered Honour. "See him! why, where did you see him?" cries Sophia. "By the canal, ma'am," says Honour. "There he hath been walking all this morning, and at last there he laid himself down: I believe he lies there still. To be sure, if it had not been for my modesty, being a maid, as I am, I should have gone and spoke to him. Do, ma'am, let me go and see, only for a fancy, whether he is there still."—"Pugh!" says Sophia. "There! no, no: what should he do there? He is gone before this time, to be sure. Besides, why一what一why
252
should you go to see? besides, I want you for something else. Go, fetch me my hat and gloves. I shall walk with my aunt in the grove before dinner." Honour did immediately as she was bid, and Sophia put her hat on; when, looking in the glass, she fancied the ribbon with which her hat was tied did not become her, and so sent her maid back again for a ribbon of a different colour; and then giving Mrs Honour repeated charges not to leave her work on any account, as she said it was in violent haste, and must be finished that very day, she muttered something more about going to the grove, and then sallied out the contrary way, and walked, as fast as her tender trembling limbs could carry her, directly towards the canal.
Jones had been there as Mrs Honour had told her; he had indeed spent two hours there that morning in melancholy contemplation on his Sophia, and had gone out from the garden at one door the moment she entered it at another. So that those unlucky minutes which had been spent in changing the ribbons, had prevented the lovers from meeting at this time;一a most unfortunate accident, from which my fair readers will not fail to draw a very wholesome lesson. And here I strictly forbid all male critics to intermeddle with a circumstance which I have recounted only for the sake of the ladies, and upon which they only are at liberty to comment.

Chapter /
A picture of formal courtship in miniature, as it always ought to be drawn, and a scene of a tenderer kind painted at full length.
It was well remarked by one (and perhaps by more), that misfortunes do not come single. This wise maxim was now verified by Sophia, who was not only disappointed of seeing the man she loved, but had the vexation of being obliged to dress herself out, in order to receive a visit from the man she hated.
That afternoon Mr Western, for the first time, acquainted his daughter with his intention; telling her, he knew very well that she had heard it before from her aunt. Sophia looked very grave upon this, nor could she prevent a few pearls from stealing into her eyes. "Come, come," says Western, "none of your maidenish airs; I know all; I assure you sister hath told me all."
"Is it possible," says Sophia, "that my aunt can have betrayed me already?"一"Ay, ay," says Western; "betrayed you! ay. Why, you betrayed yourself yesterday at dinner. You showed your fancy very plainly, I think. But you young girls never know what you would be at. So you cry because I am going to marry you to the man you are in love with! Your mother, I remember, whimpered and whined just in the same manner; but it was all over within twenty-four hours after we were married: Mr Blifil is a brisk young man, and will soon put an end to your squeamishness. Come, chear up, chear up; I expect un every minute."
Sophia was now convinced that her aunt had behaved honourably to her: and she determined to go through that disagreeable afternoon with as much resolution as possible, and without giving the least suspicion in the world to her father.
Mr Blifil soon arrived; and Mr Western soon after withdrawing, left the young couple together.
Here a long silence of near a quarter of an hour ensued; for the gentleman who was to begin the conversation had all the unbecoming modesty
254
which consists in bashfulness. He often attempted to speak, and as often suppressed his words just at the very point of utterance. At last out they broke in a torrent of far-fetched and high-strained compliments, which were answered on her side by downcast looks, half bows, and civil monosyllables. Blifil, from his inexperience in the ways of women, and from his conceit of himself, took this behaviour for a modest assent to his courtship; and when, to shorten a scene which she could no longer support, Sophia rose up and left the room, he imputed that, too, merely to bashfulness, and comforted himself that he should soon have enough of her company.
He was indeed perfectly well satisfied with his prospect of success; for as to that entire and absolute possession of the heart of his mistress which romantic lovers require, the very idea of it never entered his head. Her fortune and her person were the sole objects of his wishes, of which he made no doubt soon to obtain the absolute property; as Mr Western's mind was so earnestly bent on the match; and as he well knew the strict obedience which Sophia was always ready to pay to her father's will, and the greater still which her father would exact, if there was occasion. This authority, therefore, together with the charms which he fancied in his own person and conversation, could not fail, he thought, of succeeding with a young lady, whose inclinations were, he doubted not, entirely disengaged.
Of Jones he certainly had not even the least jealousy; and I have often thought it wonderful that he had not. Perhaps he imagined the character which Jones bore all over the country (how justly, let the reader determine), of being one of the wildest fellows in England, might render him odious to a lady of the most exemplary modesty. Perhaps his suspicions might be laid asleep by the behaviour of Sophia, and of Jones himself, when they were all in company together. Lastly, and indeed principally, he was well assured there was not another self in the case. He fancied that he knew Jones to the bottom, and had in reality a great contempt for his understanding, for not being more attached to his own interest. He had no apprehension that Jones was in love with Sophia; and as for any lucrative motives, he imagined they would sway very little with so silly a fellow. Blifil, moreover, thought the affair of Molly Seagrim still went on, and indeed believed it would end in marriage; for Jones really loved him from his childhood, and had kept no secret from him, till his behaviour on the sickness of Mr Allworthy had entirely alienated his heart; and it was by means of the quarrel which had ensued on this occasion, and which was not yet reconciled, that Mr Blifil knew nothing of the
255
alteration which had happened in the affection which Jones had formerly borne towards Molly.
From these reasons, therefore, Mr Blifil saw no bar to his success with Sophia. He concluded her behaviour was like that of all other young ladies on a first visit from a lover, and it had indeed entirely answered his expectations.
Mr Western took care to way-lay the lover at his exit from his mistress. He found him so elevated with his success, so enamoured with his daughter, and so satisfied with her reception of him, that the old gentleman began to caper and dance about his hall, and by many other antic actions to express the extravagance of his joy; for he had not the least command over any of his passions; and that which had at any time the ascendant in his mind hurried him to the wildest excesses.
As soon as Blifil was departed, which was not till after many hearty kisses and embraces bestowed on him by Western, the good squire went instantly in quest of his daughter, whom he no sooner found than he poured forth the most extravagant raptures, bidding her chuse what clothes and jewels she pleased; and declaring that he had no other use for fortune but to make her happy. He then caressed her again and again with the utmost profusion of fondness, called her by the most endearing names, and protested she was his only joy on earth.
Sophia perceiving her father in this fit of affection, which she did not absolutely know the reason of (for fits of fondness were not unusual to him, though this was rather more violent than ordinary), thought she should never have a better opportunity of disclosing herself than at present, as far at least as regarded Mr Blifil; and she too well foresaw the necessity which she should soon be under of coming to a full explanation. After having thanked the squire, therefore, for all his professions of kindness, she added, with a look full of inexpressible softness, "And is it possible my papa can be so good to place all his joy in his Sophy's happiness?" which Western having confirmed by a great oath, and a kiss; she then laid hold of his hand, and, falling on her knees, after many warm and passionate declarations of affection and duty, she begged him "not to make her the most miserable creature on earth by forcing her to marry a man whom she detested. This I entreat of you, dear sir," said she, "for your sake, as well as my own, since you are so very kind to tell me your happiness depends on mine."一"How! what!" says Western, staring wildly. "Oh! sir," continued she, "not only your poor Sophy's happiness; her very life, her being, depends upon your granting her request. I
256
cannot live with Mr Blifil. To force me into this marriage would be killing me."—"You can't live with Mr Blifil?" says Western. "No, upon my soul I can't," answered Sophia. "Then die and be d一d," cries he, spurning her from him. "Oh! sir," cries Sophia, catching hold of the skirt of his coat, "take pity on me, I beseech you. Don't look and say such cruel一Can you be unmoved while you see your Sophy in this dreadful condition? Can the best of fathers break my heart? Will he kill me by the most painful, cruel, lingering death?"一"Pooh! pooh!" cries the squire; "all stuff and nonsense; all maidenish tricks. Kill you, indeed! Will marriage kill you?"一"Oh! sir," answered Sophia, "such a marriage is worse than death. He is not even indifferent; I hate and detest him."一"If you detest un never so much," cries Western, "you shall ha'un." This he bound by an oath too shocking to repeat; and after many violent asseverations, concluded in these words: "I am resolved upon the match, and unless you consent to it I will not give you a groat, not a single farthing; no, though I saw you expiring with famine in the street, I would not relieve you with a morsel of bread. This is my fixed resolution, and so I leave you to consider on it." He then broke from her with such violence, that her face dashed against the floor; and he burst directly out of the room, leaving poor Sophia prostrate on the ground.
When Western came into the hall, he there found Jones; who seeing his friend looking wild, pale, and almost breathless, could not forbear enquiring the reason of all these melancholy appearances. Upon which the squire immediately acquainted him with the whole matter, concluding with bitter denunciations against Sophia, and very pathetic lamentations of the misery of all fathers who are so unfortunate to have daughters.
Jones, to whom all the resolutions which had been taken in favour of Blifil were yet a secret, was at first almost struck dead with this relation; but recovering his spirits a little, mere despair, as he afterwards said, inspired him to mention a matter to Mr Western, which seemed to require more impudence than a human forehead was ever gifted with. He desired leave to go to Sophia, that he might endeavour to obtain her concurrence with her father's inclinations.
If the squire had been as quicksighted as he was remarkable for the contrary, passion might at present very well have blinded him. He thanked Jones for offering to undertake the office, and said, "Go, go, prithee, try what canst do;" and then swore many execrable oaths that he would turn her out of doors unless she consented to the match.

Chapter V?
The meeting between Jones and Sophia.
Jones departed instantly in quest of Sophia, whom he found just risen from the ground, where her father had left her, with the tears trickling from her eyes, and the blood running from her lips. He presently ran to her, and with a voice full at once of tenderness and terrour, cried, "O my Sophia, what means this dreadful sight?" She looked softly at him for a moment before she spoke, and then said, "Mr Jones, for Heaven's sake how came you here?一Leave me, I beseech you, this moment."一"Do not," says he, "impose so harsh a command upon me一my heart bleeds faster than those lips. O Sophia, how easily could I drain my veins to preserve one drop of that dear blood."一"I have too many obligations to you already," answered she, "for sure you meant them such." Here she looked at him tenderly almost a minute, and then bursting into an agony, cried, "Oh, Mr Jones, why did you save my life? my death would have been happier for us both."一"Happier for us both!" cried he. "Could racks or wheels kill me so painfully as Sophia's一I cannot bear the dreadful sound. Do I live but for her?" Both his voice and looks were full of inexpressible tenderness when he spoke these words; and at the same time he laid gently hold on her hand, which she did not withdraw from him; to say the truth, she hardly knew what she did or suffered. A few moments now passed in silence between these lovers, while his eyes were eagerly fixed on Sophia, and hers declining towards the ground: at last she recovered strength enough to desire him again to leave her, for that her certain ruin would be the consequence of their being found together; adding, "Oh, Mr Jones, you know not, you know not what hath passed this cruel afternoon."一"I know all, my Sophia," answered he; "your cruel father hath told me all, and he himself hath sent me hither to you."一"My father sent you to me!" replied she: "sure you dream."一"Would to Heaven," cries he, "it was but a dream! Oh, Sophia, your father hath sent me to you, to be an advocate for my odious rival, to solicit you in his favour. I took any means to get access to you. O speak to me, Sophia!
258
comfort my bleeding heart. Sure no one ever loved, ever doated like me. Do not unkindly withhold this dear, this soft, this gentle hand一one moment, perhaps, tears you for ever from me一nothing less than this cruel occasion could, I believe, have ever conquered the respect and awe with which you have inspired me." She stood a moment silent, and covered with confusion; then lifting up her eyes gently towards him, she cried, "What would Mr Jones have me say?"一"O do but promise," cries he, "that you never will give yourself to Blifil."—"Name not," answered she, "the detested sound. Be assured I never will give him what is in my power to withhold from him."一"Now then," cries he, "while you are so perfectly kind, go a little farther, and add that I may hope."—"Alas!" says she, "Mr Jones, whither will you drive me? What hope have I to bestow? You know my father's intentions."一"But I know," answered he, "your compliance with them cannot be compelled."一"What," says she, "must be the dreadful consequence of my disobedience? My own ruin is my least concern. I cannot bear the thoughts of being the cause of my father's misery."一"He is himself the cause," cries Jones, "by exacting a power over you which Nature hath not given him. Think on the misery which I am to suffer if I am to lose you, and see on which side pity will turn the balance."一"Think of it!" replied she: "can you imagine I do not feel the ruin which I must bring on you, should I comply with your desire? It is that thought which gives me resolution to bid you fly from me for ever, and avoid your own destruction."一"I fear no destruction," cries he, "but the loss of Sophia. If you would save me from the most bitter agonies, recall that cruel sentence. Indeed, I can never part with you, indeed I cannot."
The lovers now stood both silent and trembling, Sophia being unable to withdraw her hand from Jones, and he almost as unable to hold it; when the scene, which I believe some of my readers will think had lasted long enough, was interrupted by one of so different a nature, that we shall reserve the relation of it for a different chapter.

Chapter J
Being of a much more tempestuous kind than the former.
Before we proceed with what now happened to our lovers, it may be proper to recount what had past in the hall during their tender interview.
Soon after Jones had left Mr Western in the manner above mentioned, his sister came to him, and was presently informed of all that had passed between her brother and Sophia relating to Blifil.
This behaviour in her niece the good lady construed to be an absolute breach of the condition on which she had engaged to keep her love for Mr Jones a secret. She considered herself, therefore, at full liberty to reveal all she knew to the squire, which she immediately did in the most explicit terms, and without any ceremony or preface.
The idea of a marriage between Jones and his daughter, had never once entered into the squire's head, either in the warmest minutes of his affection towards that young man, or from suspicion, or on any other occasion. He did indeed consider a parity of fortune and circumstances to be physically as necessary an ingredient in marriage, as difference of sexes, or any other essential; and had no more apprehension of his daughter's falling in love with a poor man, than with any animal of a different species.
He became, therefore, like one thunderstruck at his sister's relation. He was, at first, incapable of making any answer, having been almost deprived of his breath by the violence of the surprize. This, however, soon returned, and, as is usual in other cases after an intermission, with redoubled force and fury.
The first use he made of the power of speech, after his recovery from the sudden effects of his astonishment, was to discharge a round volley of oaths and imprecations. After which he proceeded hastily to the apartment where he expected to find the lovers, and murmured, or rather indeed roared forth, intentions of revenge every step he went.
260
As when two doves, or two wood-pigeons, or as when Strephon and Phyllis (for that comes nearest to the mark) are retired into some pleasant solitary grove, to enjoy the delightful conversation of Love, that bashful boy, who cannot speak in public, and is never a good companion to more than two at a time; here, while every object is serene, should hoarse thunder burst suddenly through the shattered clouds, and rumbling roll along the sky, the frightened maid starts from the mossy bank or verdant turf, the pale livery of death succeeds the red regimentals in which Love had before drest her cheeks, fear shakes her whole frame, and her lover scarce supports her trembling tottering limbs.
Or as when two gentlemen, strangers to the wondrous wit of the place, are cracking a bottle together at some inn or tavern at Salisbury, if the great Dowdy, who acts the part of a madman as well as some of his setters-on do that of a fool, should rattle his chains, and dreadfully hum forth the grumbling catch along the gallery; the frighted strangers stand aghast; scared at the horrid sound, they seek some place of shelter from the approaching danger; and if the well-barred windows did admit their exit, would venture their necks to escape the threatening fury now coming upon them.
So trembled poor Sophia, so turned she pale at the noise of her father, who, in a voice most dreadful to hear, came on swearing, cursing, and vowing the destruction of Jones. To say the truth, I believe the youth himself would, from some prudent considerations, have preferred another place of abode at this time, had his terror on Sophia's account given him liberty to reflect a moment on what any otherways concerned himself, than as his love made him partake whatever affected her.
And now the squire, having burst open the door, beheld an object which instantly suspended all his fury against Jones; this was the ghastly appearance of Sophia, who had fainted away in her lover's arms. This tragical sight Mr Western no sooner beheld, than all his rage forsook him; he roared for help with his utmost violence; ran first to his daughter, then back to the door calling for water, and then back again to Sophia, never considering in whose arms she then was, nor perhaps once recollecting that there was such a person in the world as Jones; for indeed I believe the present circumstances of his daughter were now the sole consideration which employed his thoughts.
Mrs Western and a great number of servants soon came to the assistance of Sophia with water, cordials, and everything necessary on those occasions. These were applied with such success, that Sophia in a very
261
few minutes began to recover, and all the symptoms of life to return. Upon which she was presently led off by her own maid and Mrs Western: nor did that good lady depart without leaving some wholesome admonitions with her brother, on the dreadful effects of his passion, or, as she pleased to call it, madness.
The squire, perhaps, did not understand this good advice, as it was delivered in obscure hints, shrugs, and notes of admiration: at least, if he did understand it, he profited very little by it; for no sooner was he cured of his immediate fears for his daughter, than he relapsed into his former frenzy, which must have produced an immediate battle with Jones, had not parson Supple, who was a very strong man, been present, and by mere force restrained the squire from acts of hostility.
The moment Sophia was departed, Jones advanced in a very suppliant manner to Mr Western, whom the parson held in his arms, and begged him to be pacified; for that, while he continued in such a passion, it would be impossible to give him any satisfaction.
"I wull have satisfaction o' thee," answered the squire; "so doff thy clothes. At unt half a man, and I'll lick thee as well as wast ever licked in thy life." He then bespattered the youth with abundance of that language which passes between country gentlemen who embrace opposite sides of the question; with frequent applications to him to salute that part which is generally introduced into all controversies that arise among the lower orders of the English gentry at horse-races, cock-matches, and other public places. Allusions to this part are likewise often made for the sake of the jest. And here, I believe, the wit is generally misunderstood. In reality, it lies in desiring another to kiss your a一 for having just before threatened to kick his; for I have observed very accurately, that no one ever desires you to kick that which belongs to himself, nor offers to kiss this part in another.
It may likewise seem surprizing that in the many thousand kind invitations of this sort, which every one who hath conversed with country gentlemen must have heard, no one, I believe, hath ever seen a single instance where the desire hath been complied with;一a great instance of their want of politeness; for in town nothing can be more common than for the finest gentlemen to perform this ceremony every day to their superiors, without having that favour once requested of them.
To all such wit, Jones very calmly answered, "Sir, this usage may perhaps cancel every other obligation you have conferred on me; but there
262
is one you can never cancel; nor will I be provoked by your abuse to lift my hand against the father of Sophia."
At these words the squire grew still more outrageous than before; so that the parson begged Jones to retire; saying, "You behold, sir, how he waxeth wrath at your abode here; therefore let me pray you not to tarry any longer. His anger is too much kindled for you to commune with him at present. You had better, therefore, conclude your visit, and refer what matters you have to urge in your behalf to some other opportunity."
Jones accepted this advice with thanks, and immediately departed. The squire now regained the liberty of his hands, and so much temper as to express some satisfaction in the restraint which had been laid upon him; declaring that he should certainly have beat his brains out; and adding, "It would have vexed one confoundedly to have been hanged for such a rascal."
The parson now began to triumph in the success of his peace-making endeavours, and proceeded to read a lecture against anger, which might perhaps rather have tended to raise than to quiet that passion in some hasty minds. This lecture he enriched with many valuable quotations from the antients, particularly from Seneca; who hath indeed so well handled this passion, that none but a very angry man can read him without great pleasure and profit. The doctor concluded this harangue with the famous story of Alexander and Clitus; but as I find that entered in my common-place under title Drunkenness, I shall not insert it here.
The squire took no notice of this story, nor perhaps of anything he said; for he interrupted him before he had finished, by calling for a tankard of beer; observing (which is perhaps as true as any observation on this fever of the mind) that anger makes a man dry.
No sooner had the squire swallowed a large draught than he renewed the discourse on Jones, and declared a resolution of going the next morning early to acquaint Mr Allworthy. His friend would have dissuaded him from this, from the mere motive of good-nature; but his dissuasion had no other effect than to produce a large volley of oaths and curses, which greatly shocked the pious ears of Supple; but he did not dare to remonstrate against a privilege which the squire claimed as a freeborn Englishman. To say truth, the parson submitted to please his palate at the squire's table, at the expense of suffering now and then this violence to his ears. He contented himself with thinking he did not promote this evil practice, and that the squire would not swear an oath the less, if he never entered within his gates. However, though he was not guilty of ill
263
manners by rebuking a gentleman in his own house, he paid him off obliquely in the pulpit: which had not, indeed, the good effect of working a reformation in the squire himself; yet it so far operated on his conscience, that he put the laws very severely in execution against others, and the magistrate was the only person in the parish who could swear with impunity.

Chapter A Vx
In which Mr Western visits Mr Allworthy.
Mr Allworthy was now retired from breakfast with his nephew, well satisfied with the report of the young gentleman's successful visit to Sophia (for he greatly desired the match, more on account of the young lady's character than of her riches), when Mr Western broke abruptly in upon them, and without any ceremony began as follows:一
"There, you have done a fine piece of work truly! You have brought up your bastard to a fine purpose; not that I believe you have had any hand in it neither, that is, as a man may say, designedly: but there is a fine kettle-of-fish made on't up at our house." "What can be the matter, Mr Western?" said Allworthy. "O, matter enow of all conscience: my daughter hath fallen in love with your bastard, that's all; but I won't ge her a hapeny, not the twentieth part of a brass varden. I always thought what would come o' breeding up a bastard like a gentleman, and letting un come about to vok's houses. It's well vor un I could not get at un: I'd a lick'd un; I'd a spoil'd his caterwauling; I'd a taught the son of a whore to meddle with meat for his master. He shan't ever have a morsel of meat of mine, or a varden to buy it: if she will ha un, one smock shall be her portion. I'd sooner ge my esteate to the zinking fund, that it may be sent to Hanover to corrupt our nation with." "I am heartily sorry," cries Allworthy. "Pox o' your sorrow," says Western; "it will do me abundance of good when I have lost my only child, my poor Sophy, that was the joy of my heart, and all the hope and comfort of my age; but I am resolved I will turn her out o' doors; she shall beg, and starve, and rot in the streets. Not one hapeny, not a hapeny shall she ever hae o' mine. The son of a bitch was always good at finding a hare sitting, an be rotted to'n: I little thought what puss he was looking after; but it shall be the worst he ever vound in his life. She shall be no better than carrion: the skin o'er is all he shall ha, and zu you may tell un." "I am in amazement," cries Allworthy, "at what you tell me, after what passed between my nephew and the young lady no longer ago than yesterday." "Yes, sir," answered Western,
265
"it was after what passed between your nephew and she that the whole matter came out. Mr Blifil there was no sooner gone than the son of a whore came lurching about the house. Little did I think when I used to love him for a sportsman that he was all the while a poaching after my daughter." "Why truly," says Allworthy, "I could wish you had not given him so many opportunities with her; and you will do me the justice to acknowledge that I have always been averse to his staying so much at your house, though I own I had no suspicion of this kind." "Why, zounds," cries Western, "who could have thought it? What the devil had she to do wi'n? He did not come there a courting to her; he came there a hunting with me." "But was it possible," says Allworthy, "that you should never discern any symptoms of love between them, when you have seen them so often together?" "Never in my life, as I hope to be saved," cries Western: "I never so much as zeed him kiss her in all my life; and so far from courting her, he used rather to be more silent when she was in company than at any other time; and as for the girl, she was always less civil to'n than to any young man that came to the house. As to that matter, I am not more easy to be deceived than another; I would not have you think I am, neighbour." Allworthy could scarce refrain laughter at this; but he resolved to do a violence to himself; for he perfectly well knew mankind, and had too much good-breeding and goodnature to offend the squire in his present circumstances. He then asked Western what he would have him do upon this occasion. To which the other answered, "That he would have him keep the rascal away from his house, and that he would go and lock up the wench; for he was resolved to make her marry Mr Blifil in spite of her teeth." He then shook Blifil by the hand, and swore he would have no other son-in-law. Presently after which he took his leave; saying his house was in such disorder that it was necessary for him to make haste home, to take care his daughter did not give him the slip; and as for Jones, he swore if he caught him at his house, he would qualify him to run for the geldings' plate.
When Allworthy and Blifil were again left together, a long silence ensued between them; all which interval the young gentleman filled up with sighs, which proceeded partly from disappointment, but more from hatred; for the success of Jones was much more grievous to him than the loss of Sophia.
At length his uncle asked him what he was determined to do, and he answered in the following words:—"Alas! sir, can it be a question what step a lover will take, when reason and passion point different ways? I am afraid it is too certain he will, in that dilemma, always follow the
266
latter. Reason dictates to me, to quit all thoughts of a woman who places her affections on another; my passion bids me hope she may in time change her inclinations in my favour. Here, however, I conceive an objection may be raised, which, if it could not fully be answered, would totally deter me from any further pursuit. I mean the injustice of endeavouring to supplant another in a heart of which he seems already in possession; but the determined resolution of Mr Western shows that, in this case, I shall, by so doing, promote the happiness of every party; not only that of the parent, who will thus be preserved from the highest degree of misery, but of both the others, who must be undone by this match. The lady, I am sure, will be undone in every sense; for, besides the loss of most part of her own fortune, she will be not only married to a beggar, but the little fortune which her father cannot withhold from her will be squandered on that wench with whom I know he yet converses. Nay, that is a trifle; for I know him to be one of the worst men in the world; for had my dear uncle known what I have hitherto endeavoured to conceal, he must have long since abandoned so profligate a wretch." "How!" said Allworthy; "hath he done anything worse than I already know? Tell me, I beseech you?" "No," replied Blifil; "it is now past, and perhaps he may have repented of it." "I command you, on your duty," said Allworthy, "to tell me what you mean." "You know, sir," says Blifil, "I never disobeyed you; but I am sorry I mentioned it, since it may now look like revenge, whereas, I thank Heaven, no such motive ever entered my heart; and if you oblige me to discover it, I must be his petitioner to you for your forgiveness." "I will have no conditions," answered Allworthy; "I think I have shown tenderness enough towards him, and more perhaps than you ought to thank me for." "More, indeed, I fear, than he deserved," cries Blifil; "for in the very day of your utmost danger, when myself and all the family were in tears, he filled the house with riot and debauchery. He drank, and sung, and roared; and when I gave him a gentle hint of the indecency of his actions, he fell into a violent passion, swore many oaths, called me rascal, and struck me." "How!" cries Allworthy; "did he dare to strike you?" "I am sure," cries Blifil, "I have forgiven him that long ago. I wish I could so easily forget his ingratitude to the best of benefactors; and yet even that I hope you will forgive him, since he must have certainly been possessed with the devil: for that very evening, as Mr Thwackum and myself were taking the air in the fields, and exulting in the good symptoms which then first began to discover themselves, we unluckily saw him engaged with a wench in a manner not fit to be mentioned. Mr Thwackum, with more boldness than
267
prudence, advanced to rebuke him, when (I am sorry to say it) he fell upon the worthy man, and beat him so outrageously that I wish he may have yet recovered the bruises. Nor was I without my share of the effects of his malice, while I endeavoured to protect my tutor; but that I have long forgiven; nay, I prevailed with Mr Thwackum to forgive him too, and not to inform you of a secret which I feared might be fatal to him. And now, sir, since I have unadvisedly dropped a hint of this matter, and your commands have obliged me to discover the whole, let me intercede with you for him." "O child!" said Allworthy, "I know not whether I should blame or applaud your goodness, in concealing such villany a moment: but where is Mr Thwackum? Not that I want any confirmation of what you say; but I will examine all the evidence of this matter, to justify to the world the example I am resolved to make of such a monster."
Thwackum was now sent for, and presently appeared. He corroborated every circumstance which the other had deposed; nay, he produced the record upon his breast, where the handwriting of Mr Jones remained very legible in black and blue. He concluded with declaring to Mr Allworthy, that he should have long since informed him of this matter, had not Mr Blifil, by the most earnest interpositions, prevented him. "He is," says he, "an excellent youth: though such forgiveness of enemies is carrying the matter too far."
In reality, Blifil had taken some pains to prevail with the parson, and to prevent the discovery at that time; for which he had many reasons. He knew that the minds of men are apt to be softened and relaxed from their usual severity by sickness. Besides, he imagined that if the story was told when the fact was so recent, and the physician about the house, who might have unravelled the real truth, he should never be able to give it the malicious turn which he intended. Again, he resolved to hoard up this business, till the indiscretion of Jones should afford some additional complaints; for he thought the joint weight of many facts falling upon him together, would be the most likely to crush him; and he watched, therefore, some such opportunity as that with which fortune had now kindly presented him. Lastly, by prevailing with Thwackum to conceal the matter for a time, he knew he should confirm an opinion of his friendship to Jones, which he had greatly laboured to establish in Mr Allworthy.
268
A short chapter; but which contains sufficient matter to affect the good-natured reader.
It was Mr Allworthy's custom never to punish any one, not even to turn away a servant, in a passion. He resolved therefore to delay passing sentence on Jones till the afternoon.
The poor young man attended at dinner, as usual; but his heart was too much loaded to suffer him to eat. His grief too was a good deal aggravated by the unkind looks of Mr Allworthy; whence he concluded that Western had discovered the whole affair between him and Sophia; but as to Mr Blifil's story, he had not the least apprehension; for of much the greater part he was entirely innocent; and for the residue, as he had forgiven and forgotten it himself, so he suspected no remembrance on the other side. When dinner was over, and the servants departed, Mr Allworthy began to harangue. He set forth, in a long speech, the many iniquities of which Jones had been guilty, particularly those which this day had brought to light; and concluded by telling him, "That unless he could clear himself of the charge, he was resolved to banish him his sight for ever."
Many disadvantages attended poor Jones in making his defence; nay, indeed, he hardly knew his accusation; for as Mr Allworthy, in recounting the drunkenness, &amp;c., while he lay ill, out of modesty sunk everything that related particularly to himself, which indeed principally constituted the crime; Jones could not deny the charge. His heart was, besides, almost broken already; and his spirits were so sunk, that he could say nothing for himself; but acknowledged the whole, and, like a criminal in despair, threw himself upon mercy; concluding, "That though he must own himself guilty of many follies and inadvertencies, he hoped he had done nothing to deserve what would be to him the greatest punishment in the world."
269
Allworthy answered, "That he had forgiven him too often already, in compassion to his youth, and in hopes of his amendment: that he now found he was an abandoned reprobate, and such as it would be criminal in any one to support and encourage. Nay," said Mr Allworthy to him, "your audacious attempt to steal away the young lady, calls upon me to justify my own character in punishing you. The world who have already censured the regard I have shown for you may think, with some colour at least of justice, that I connive at so base and barbarous an action一an action of which you must have known my abhorrence: and which, had you had any concern for my ease and honour, as well as for my friendship, you would never have thought of undertaking. Fie upon it, young man! indeed there is scarce any punishment equal to your crimes, and I can scarce think myself justifiable in what I am now going to bestow on you. However, as I have educated you like a child of my own, I will not turn you naked into the world. When you open this paper, therefore, you will find something which may enable you, with industry, to get an honest livelihood; but if you employ it to worse purposes, I shall not think myself obliged to supply you farther, being resolved, from this day forward, to converse no more with you on any account. I cannot avoid saying, there is no part of your conduct which I resent more than your ill-treatment of that good young man (meaning Blifil) who hath behaved with so much tenderness and honour towards you."
These last words were a dose almost too bitter to be swallowed. A flood of tears now gushed from the eyes of Jones, and every faculty of speech and motion seemed to have deserted him. It was some time before he was able to obey Allworthy's peremptory commands of departing; which he at length did, having first kissed his hands with a passion difficult to be affected, and as difficult to be described.
The reader must be very weak, if, when he considers the light in which Jones then appeared to Mr Allworthy, he should blame the rigour of his sentence. And yet all the neighbourhood, either from this weakness, or from some worse motive, condemned this justice and severity as the highest cruelty. Nay, the very persons who had before censured the good man for the kindness and tenderness shown to a bastard (his own, according to the general opinion), now cried out as loudly against turning his own child out of doors. The women especially were unanimous in taking the part of Jones, and raised more stories on the occasion than I have room, in this chapter, to set down.
One thing must not be omitted, that, in their censures on this occasion, none ever mentioned the sum contained in the paper which Allworthy
270
gave Jones, which was no less than five hundred pounds; but all agreed that he was sent away penniless, and some said naked, from the house of his inhuman father.
271

Chapter 且
Containing love-letters, &amp;c.
Jones was commanded to leave the house immediately, and told, that his clothes and everything else should be sent to him whithersoever he should order them.
He accordingly set out, and walked above a mile, not regarding, and indeed scarce knowing, whither he went. At length a little brook obstructing his passage, he threw himself down by the side of it; nor could he help muttering with some little indignation, "Sure my father will not deny me this place to rest in!"
Here he presently fell into the most violent agonies, tearing his hair from his head, and using most other actions which generally accompany fits of madness, rage, and despair.
When he had in this manner vented the first emotions of passion, he began to come a little to himself. His grief now took another turn, and discharged itself in a gentler way, till he became at last cool enough to reason with his passion, and to consider what steps were proper to be taken in his deplorable condition.
And now the great doubt was, how to act with regard to Sophia. The thoughts of leaving her almost rent his heart asunder; but the consideration of reducing her to ruin and beggary still racked him, if possible, more; and if the violent desire of possessing her person could have induced him to listen one moment to this alternative, still he was by no means certain of her resolution to indulge his wishes at so high an expense. The resentment of Mr Allworthy, and the injury he must do to his quiet, argued strongly against this latter; and lastly, the apparent impossibility of his success, even if he would sacrifice all these considerations to it, came to his assistance; and thus honour at last backed with despair, with gratitude to his benefactor, and with real love to his mistress, got the better of burning desire, and he resolved rather to quit Sophia, than pursue her to her ruin.
27
It is difficult for any who have not felt it, to conceive the glowing warmth which filled his breast on the first contemplation of this victory over his passion. Pride flattered him so agreeably, that his mind perhaps enjoyed perfect happiness; but this was only momentary: Sophia soon returned to his imagination, and allayed the joy of his triumph with no less bitter pangs than a good-natured general must feel, when he surveys the bleeding heaps, at the price of whose blood he hath purchased his laurels; for thousands of tender ideas lay murdered before our conqueror.
Being resolved, however, to pursue the paths of this giant honour, as the gigantic poet Lee calls it, he determined to write a farewel letter to Sophia; and accordingly proceeded to a house not far off, where, being furnished with proper materials, he wrote as follows:一
"MADAM,
"When you reflect on the situation in which I write, I am sure your good-nature will pardon any inconsistency or absurdity which my letter contains; for everything here flows from a heart so full, that no language can express its dictates.
"I have resolved, madam, to obey your commands, in flying for ever from your dear, your lovely sight. Cruel indeed those commands are; but it is a cruelty which proceeds from fortune, not from my Sophia. Fortune hath made it necessary, necessary to your preservation, to forget there ever was such a wretch as I am.
"Believe me, I would not hint all my sufferings to you, if I imagined they could possibly escape your ears. I know the goodness and tenderness of your heart, and would avoid giving you any of those pains which you always feel for the miserable. O let nothing, which you shall hear of my hard fortune, cause a moment's concern; for, after the loss of you, everything is to me a trifle.
"O Sophia! it is hard to leave you; it is harder still to desire you to forget me; yet the sincerest love obliges me to both. Pardon my conceiving that any remembrance of me can give you disquiet; but if I am so gloriously wretched, sacrifice me every way to your relief. Think I never loved you; or think truly how little I deserve you; and learn to scorn me for a presumption which can never be too severely punished.一I am unable to say more.一May guardian angels protect you for ever!"
He was now searching his pockets for his wax, but found none, nor indeed anything else, therein; for in truth he had, in his frantic disposition, tossed everything from him, and amongst the rest, his pocket-book,
273
which he had received from Mr Allworthy, which he had never opened, and which now first occurred to his memory.
The house supplied him with a wafer for his present purpose, with which, having sealed his letter, he returned hastily towards the brook side, in order to search for the things which he had there lost. In his way he met his old friend Black George, who heartily condoled with him on his misfortune; for this had already reached his ears, and indeed those of all the neighbourhood.
Jones acquainted the gamekeeper with his loss, and he as readily went back with him to the brook, where they searched every tuft of grass in the meadow, as well where Jones had not been as where he had been; but all to no purpose, for they found nothing; for, indeed, though the things were then in the meadow, they omitted to search the only place where they were deposited; to wit, in the pockets of the said George; for he had just before found them, and being luckily apprized of their value, had very carefully put them up for his own use.
The gamekeeper having exerted as much diligence in quest of the lost goods, as if he had hoped to find them, desired Mr Jones to recollect if he had been in no other place: "For sure," said he, "if you had lost them here so lately, the things must have been here still; for this is a very unlikely place for any one to pass by." And indeed it was by great accident that he himself had passed through that field, in order to lay wires for hares, with which he was to supply a poulterer at Bath the next morning.
Jones now gave over all hopes of recovering his loss, and almost all thoughts concerning it, and turning to Black George, asked him earnestly if he would do him the greatest favour in the world?
George answered with some hesitation, "Sir, you know you may command me whatever is in my power, and I heartily wish it was in my power to do you any service." In fact, the question staggered him; for he had, by selling game, amassed a pretty good sum of money in Mr Western's service, and was afraid that Jones wanted to borrow some small matter of him; but he was presently relieved from his anxiety, by being desired to convey a letter to Sophia, which with great pleasure he promised to do. And indeed I believe there are few favours which he would not have gladly conferred on Mr Jones; for he bore as much gratitude towards him as he could, and was as honest as men who love money better than any other thing in the universe, generally are.
Mrs Honour was agreed by both to be the proper means by which this letter should pass to Sophia. They then separated; the gamekeeper
274
returned home to Mr Western's, and Jones walked to an alehouse at half a mile's distance, to wait for his messenger's return.
George no sooner came home to his master's house than he met with Mrs Honour; to whom, having first sounded her with a few previous questions, he delivered the letter for her mistress, and received at the same time another from her, for Mr Jones; which Honour told him she had carried all that day in her bosom, and began to despair of finding any means of delivering it.
The gamekeeper returned hastily and joyfully to Jones, who, having received Sophia's letter from him, instantly withdrew, and eagerly breaking it open, read as follows:一
"SIR,
"It is impossible to express what I have felt since I saw you. Your submitting, on my account, to such cruel insults from my father, lays me under an obligation I shall ever own. As you know his temper, I beg you will, for my sake, avoid him. I wish I had any comfort to send you; but believe this, that nothing but the last violence shall ever give my hand or heart where you would be sorry to see them bestowed."
Jones read this letter a hundred times over, and kissed it a hundred times as often. His passion now brought all tender desires back into his mind. He repented that he had writ to Sophia in the manner we have seen above; but he repented more that he had made use of the interval of his messenger's absence to write and dispatch a letter to Mr Allworthy, in which he had faithfully promised and bound himself to quit all thoughts of his love. However, when his cool reflections returned, he plainly perceived that his case was neither mended nor altered by Sophia's billet, unless to give him some little glimpse of hope, from her constancy, of some favourable accident hereafter. He therefore resumed his resolution, and taking leave of Black George, set forward to a town about five miles distant, whither he had desired Mr Allworthy, unless he pleased to revoke his sentence, to send his things after him.

Chapter 且 U
The behaviour of Sophia on the present occasion; which none of her sex will blame, who are capable of behaving in the same manner. And the discussion of a knotty point in the court of conscience.
Sophia had passed the last twenty-four hours in no very desirable manner. During a large part of them she had been entertained by her aunt with lectures of prudence, recommending to her the example of the polite world, where love (so the good lady said) is at present entirely laughed at, and where women consider matrimony, as men do offices of public trust, only as the means of making their fortunes, and of advancing themselves in the world. In commenting on which text Mrs Western had displayed her eloquence during several hours.
These sagacious lectures, though little suited either to the taste or inclination of Sophia, were, however, less irksome to her than her own thoughts, that formed the entertainment of the night, during which she never once closed her eyes.
But though she could neither sleep nor rest in her bed, yet, having no avocation from it, she was found there by her father at his return from Allworthy's, which was not till past ten o'clock in the morning. He went directly up to her apartment, opened the door, and seeing she was not up, cried, "Oh! you are safe then, and I am resolved to keep you so." He then locked the door, and delivered the key to Honour, having first given her the strictest charge, with great promises of rewards for her fidelity, and most dreadful menaces of punishment in case she should betray her trust.
Honour's orders were, not to suffer her mistress to come out of her room without the authority of the squire himself, and to admit none to her but him and her aunt; but she was herself to attend her with whatever Sophia pleased, except only pen, ink, and paper, of which she was forbidden the use.
276
The squire ordered his daughter to dress herself and attend him at dinner; which she obeyed; and having sat the usual time, was again conducted to her prison.
In the evening the gaoler Honour brought her the letter which she received from the gamekeeper. Sophia read it very attentively twice or thrice over, and then threw herself upon the bed, and burst into a flood of tears. Mrs Honour expressed great astonishment at this behaviour in her mistress; nor could she forbear very eagerly begging to know the cause of this passion. Sophia made her no answer for some time, and then, starting suddenly up, caught her maid by the hand, and cried, "O Honour! I am undone." "Marry forbid," cries Honour: "I wish the letter had been burnt before I had brought it to your la'ship. I'm sure I thought it would have comforted your la'ship, or I would have seen it at the devil before I would have touched it." "Honour," says Sophia, "you are a good girl, and it is vain to attempt concealing longer my weakness from you; I have thrown away my heart on a man who hath forsaken me." "And is Mr Jones," answered the maid, "such a perfidy man?" "He hath taken his leave of me," says Sophia, "for ever in that letter. Nay, he hath desired me to forget him. Could he have desired that if he had loved me? Could he have borne such a thought? Could he have written such a word?" "No, certainly, ma'am," cries Honour; "and to be sure, if the best man in England was to desire me to forget him, I'd take him at his word. Marry, come up! I am sure your la'ship hath done him too much honour ever to think on him;一a young lady who may take her choice of all the young men in the country. And to be sure, if I may be so presumptuous as to offer my poor opinion, there is young Mr Blifil, who, besides that he is come of honest parents, and will be one of the greatest squires all hereabouts, he is to be sure, in my poor opinion, a more handsomer and a more politer man by half; and besides, he is a young gentleman of a sober character, and who may defy any of the neighbours to say black is his eye; he follows no dirty trollops, nor can any bastards be laid at his door. Forget him, indeed! I thank Heaven I myself am not so much at my last prayers as to suffer any man to bid me forget him twice. If the best he that wears a head was for to go for to offer to say such an affronting word to me, I would never give him my company afterwards, if there was another young man in the kingdom. And as I was a saying, to be sure, there is young Mr Blifil." "Name not his detested name," cries Sophia. "Nay, ma'am," says Honour, "if your la'ship doth not like him, there be more jolly handsome young men that would court your la'ship, if they had but the least encouragement. I don't believe there is arrow
277
young gentleman in this county, or in the next to it, that if your la'ship was but to look as if you had a mind to him, would not come about to make his offers directly." "What a wretch dost thou imagine me," cries Sophia, "by affronting my ears with such stuff! I detest all mankind." "Nay, to be sure, ma'am," answered Honour, "your la'ship hath had enough to give you a surfeit of them. To be used ill by such a poor, beggarly, bastardly fellow."一"Hold your blasphemous tongue," cries Sophia: "how dare you mention his name with disrespect before me? He use me ill? No, his poor bleeding heart suffered more when he writ the cruel words than mine from reading them. O! he is all heroic virtue and angelic goodness. I am ashamed of the weakness of my own passion, for blaming what I ought to admire. O, Honour! it is my good only which he consults. To my interest he sacrifices both himself and me. The apprehension of ruining me hath driven him to despair." "I am very glad," says Honour, "to hear your la'ship takes that into your consideration; for to be sure, it must be nothing less than ruin to give your mind to one that is turned out of doors, and is not worth a farthing in the world." "Turned out of doors!" cries Sophia hastily: "how! what dost thou mean?" "Why, to be sure, ma'am, my master no sooner told Squire Allworthy about Mr Jones having offered to make love to your la'ship than the squire stripped him stark naked, and turned him out of doors!" "Ha!" says Sophia, "I have been the cursed, wretched cause of his destruction! Turned naked out of doors! Here, Honour, take all the money I have; take the rings from my fingers. Here, my watch: carry him all. Go find him immediately." "For Heaven's sake, ma'am," answered Mrs Honour, "do but consider, if my master should miss any of these things, I should be made to answer for them. Therefore let me beg your la'ship not to part with your watch and jewels. Besides, the money, I think, is enough of all conscience; and as for that, my master can never know anything of the matter." "Here, then," cries Sophia, "take every farthing I am worth, find him out immediately, and give it him. Go, go, lose not a moment."
Mrs Honour departed according to orders, and finding Black George below-stairs, delivered him the purse, which contained sixteen guineas, being, indeed, the whole stock of Sophia; for though her father was very liberal to her, she was much too generous to be rich.
Black George having received the purse, set forward towards the alehouse; but in the way a thought occurred to him, whether he should not detain this money likewise. His conscience, however, immediately started at this suggestion, and began to upbraid him with ingratitude to his benefactor. To this his avarice answered, That his conscience should
278
have considered the matter before, when he deprived poor Jones of his £500. That having quietly acquiesced in what was of so much greater importance, it was absurd, if not downright hypocrisy, to affect any qualms at this trifle. In return to which, Conscience, like a good lawyer, attempted to distinguish between an absolute breach of trust, as here, where the goods were delivered, and a bare concealment of what was found, as in the former case. Avarice presently treated this with ridicule, called it a distinction without a difference, and absolutely insisted that when once all pretensions of honour and virtue were given up in any one instance, that there was no precedent for resorting to them upon a second occasion. In short, poor Conscience had certainly been defeated in the argument, had not Fear stept in to her assistance, and very strenuously urged that the real distinction between the two actions, did not lie in the different degrees of honour but of safety: for that the secreting the £500 was a matter of very little hazard; whereas the detaining the sixteen guineas was liable to the utmost danger of discovery.
By this friendly aid of Fear, Conscience obtained a compleat victory in the mind of Black George, and, after making him a few compliments on his honesty, forced him to deliver the money to Jones.

Chapter 且 T
A short chapter, containing a short dialogue between Squire Western and his sister.
Mrs Western had been engaged abroad all that day. The squire met her at her return home; and when she enquired after Sophia, he acquainted her that he had secured her safe enough. "She is locked up in chamber," cries he, "and Honour keeps the key." As his looks were full of prodigious wisdom and sagacity when he gave his sister this information, it is probable he expected much applause from her for what he had done; but how was he disappointed when, with a most disdainful aspect, she cried, "Sure, brother, you are the weakest of all men. Why will you not confide in me for the management of my niece? Why will you interpose? You have now undone all that I have been spending my breath in order to bring about. While I have been endeavouring to fill her mind with maxims of prudence, you have been provoking her to reject them. English women, brother, I thank heaven, are no slaves. We are not to be locked up like the Spanish and Italian wives. We have as good a right to liberty as yourselves. We are to be convinced by reason and persuasion only, and not governed by force. I have seen the world, brother, and know what arguments to make use of; and if your folly had not prevented me, should have prevailed with her to form her conduct by those rules of prudence and discretion which I formerly taught her." "To be sure," said the squire, "I am always in the wrong." "Brother," answered the lady, "you are not in the wrong, unless when you meddle with matters beyond your knowledge. You must agree that I have seen most of the world; and happy had it been for my niece if she had not been taken from under my care. It is by living at home with you that she hath learnt romantic notions of love and nonsense." "You don't imagine, I hope," cries the squire, "that I have taught her any such things." "Your ignorance, brother," returned she, "as the great Milton says, almost subdues my patience." 6 "D一n Milton!" answered the squire: "if he had the impudence to say so to my face, I'd lend him a douse, thof he was never so
280
great a man. Patience! An you come to that, sister, I have more occasion of patience, to be used like an overgrown schoolboy, as I am by you. Do you think no one hath any understanding, unless he hath been about at court. Pox! the world is come to a fine pass indeed, if we are all fools, except a parcel of round-heads and Hanover rats. Pox! I hope the times are a coming when we shall make fools of them, and every man shall enjoy his own. That's all, sister; and every man shall enjoy his own. I hope to zee it, sister, before the Hanover rats have eat up all our corn, and left us nothing but turneps to feed upon."一"I protest, brother," cries she, "you are now got beyond my understanding. Your jargon of turneps and Hanover rats is to me perfectly unintelligible."一"I believe," cries he, "you don't care to hear o'em; but the country interest may succeed one day or other for all that."一"I wish," answered the lady, "you would think a little of your daughter's interest; for, believe me, she is in greater danger than the nation."一"Just now," said he, "you chid me for thinking on her, and would ha' her left to you."—"And if you will promise to interpose no more," answered she, "I will, out of my regard to my niece, undertake the charge."一"Well, do then," said the squire, "for you know I always agreed, that women are the properest to manage women."
Mrs Western then departed, muttering something with an air of disdain, concerning women and management of the nation. She immediately repaired to Sophia's apartment, who was now, after a day's confinement, released again from her captivity.

Chapter 且
A comparison between the world and the stage.
The world hath been often compared to the theatre; and many grave writers, as well as the poets, have considered human life as a great drama, resembling, in almost every particular, those scenical representations which Thespis is first reported to have invented, and which have been since received with so much approbation and delight in all polite countries.
This thought hath been carried so far, and is become so general, that some words proper to the theatre, and which were at first metaphorically applied to the world, are now indiscriminately and literally spoken of both; thus stage and scene are by common use grown as familiar to us, when we speak of life in general, as when we confine ourselves to dramatic performances: and when transactions behind the curtain are mentioned, St James's is more likely to occur to our thoughts than Drury-lane.
It may seem easy enough to account for all this, by reflecting that the theatrical stage is nothing more than a representation, or, as Aristotle calls it, an imitation of what really exists; and hence, perhaps, we might fairly pay a very high compliment to those who by their writings or actions have been so capable of imitating life, as to have their pictures in a manner confounded with, or mistaken for, the originals.
But, in reality, we are not so fond of paying compliments to these people, whom we use as children frequently do the instruments of their amusement; and have much more pleasure in hissing and buffeting them, than in admiring their excellence. There are many other reasons which have induced us to see this analogy between the world and the stage.
Some have considered the larger part of mankind in the light of actors, as personating characters no more their own, and to which in fact they have no better title, than the player hath to be in earnest thought the king
283
or emperor whom he represents. Thus the hypocrite may be said to be a player; and indeed the Greeks called them both by one and the same name.
The brevity of life hath likewise given occasion to this comparison. So the immortal Shakespear一
一Life's a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more.
For which hackneyed quotation I will make the reader amends by a very noble one, which few, I believe, have read. It is taken from a poem called the Deity, published about nine years ago, and long since buried in oblivion; a proof that good books, no more than good men, do always survive the bad.
From Thee 7 all human actions take their springs, The rise of empires and the fall of kings! See the vast Theatre of Time display'd, While o'er the scene succeeding heroes tread! With pomp the shining images succeed, What leaders triumph, and what monarchs bleed! Perform the parts thy providence assign'd, Their pride, their passions, to thy ends inclin'd: Awhile they glitter in the face of day, Then at thy nod the phantoms pass away; No traces left of all the busy scene, But that remembrance says一The things have been!
In all these, however, and in every other similitude of life to the theatre, the resemblance hath been always taken from the stage only. None, as I remember, have at all considered the audience at this great drama.
But as Nature often exhibits some of her best performances to a very full house, so will the behaviour of her spectators no less admit the above-mentioned comparison than that of her actors. In this vast theatre of time are seated the friend and the critic; here are claps and shouts, hisses and groans; in short, everything which was ever seen or heard at the Theatre-Royal.
Let us examine this in one example; for instance, in the behaviour of the great audience on that scene which Nature was pleased to exhibit in the twelfth chapter of the preceding book, where she introduced Black George running away with the £500 from his friend and benefactor.
Those who sat in the world's upper gallery treated that incident, I am well convinced, with their usual vociferation; and every term of scurrilous reproach was most probably vented on that occasion.
7.The Deity.
284
If we had descended to the next order of spectators, we should have found an equal degree of abhorrence, though less of noise and scurrility; yet here the good women gave Black George to the devil, and many of them expected every minute that the cloven-footed gentleman would fetch his own.
The pit, as usual, was no doubt divided; those who delight in heroic virtue and perfect character objected to the producing such instances of villany, without punishing them very severely for the sake of example. Some of the author's friends cryed, "Look'e, gentlemen, the man is a villain, but it is nature for all that." And all the young critics of the age, the clerks, apprentices, &amp;c., called it low, and fell a groaning.
As for the boxes, they behaved with their accustomed politeness. Most of them were attending to something else. Some of those few who regarded the scene at all, declared he was a bad kind of man; while others refused to give their opinion, till they had heard that of the best judges.
Now we, who are admitted behind the scenes of this great theatre of Nature (and no author ought to write anything besides dictionaries and spelling-books who hath not this privilege), can censure the action, without conceiving any absolute detestation of the person, whom perhaps Nature may not have designed to act an ill part in all her dramas; for in this instance life most exactly resembles the stage, since it is often the same person who represents the villain and the heroe; and he who engages your admiration to-day will probably attract your contempt tomorrow. As Garrick, whom I regard in tragedy to be the greatest genius the world hath ever produced, sometimes condescends to play the fool; so did Scipio the Great, and Laelius the Wise, according to Horace, many years ago; nay, Cicero reports them to have been "incredibly childish." These, it is true, played the fool, like my friend Garrick, in jest only; but several eminent characters have, in numberless instances of their lives, played the fool egregiously in earnest; so far as to render it a matter of some doubt whether their wisdom or folly was predominant; or whether they were better intitled to the applause or censure, the admiration or contempt, the love or hatred, of mankind.
Those persons, indeed, who have passed any time behind the scenes of this great theatre, and are thoroughly acquainted not only with the several disguises which are there put on, but also with the fantastic and capricious behaviour of the Passions, who are the managers and directors of this theatre (for as to Reason, the patentee, he is known to be a very idle fellow and seldom to exert himself), may most probably have
285
learned to understand the famous nil admirari of Horace, or in the English phrase, to stare at nothing.
A single bad act no more constitutes a villain in life, than a single bad part on the stage. The passions, like the managers of a playhouse, often force men upon parts without consulting their judgment, and sometimes without any regard to their talents. Thus the man, as well as the player, may condemn what he himself acts; nay, it is common to see vice sit as awkwardly on some men, as the character of Iago would on the honest face of Mr William Mills.
Upon the whole, then, the man of candour and of true understanding is never hasty to condemn. He can censure an imperfection, or even a vice, without rage against the guilty party. In a word, they are the same folly, the same childishness, the same ill-breeding, and the same ill-nature, which raise all the clamours and uproars both in life and on the stage. The worst of men generally have the words rogue and villain most in their mouths, as the lowest of all wretches are the aptest to cry out low in the pit.

Chapter
Containing a conversation which Mr Jones had with himself.
Jones received his effects from Mr Allworthy's early in the morning, with the following answer to his letter:一
"SIR,
"I am commanded by my uncle to acquaint you, that as he did not proceed to those measures he had taken with you, without the greatest deliberation, and after the fullest evidence of your unworthiness, so will it be always out of your power to cause the least alteration in his resolution. He expresses great surprize at your presumption in saying you have resigned all pretensions to a young lady, to whom it is impossible you should ever have had any, her birth and fortune having made her so infinitely your superior. Lastly, I am commanded to tell you, that the only instance of your compliance with my uncle's inclinations which he requires, is, your immediately quitting this country. I cannot conclude this without offering you my advice, as a Christian, that you would seriously think of amending your life. That you may be assisted with grace so to do, will be always the prayer of
"Your humble servant,
"W. BLIFIL."
Many contending passions were raised in our heroe's mind by this letter; but the tender prevailed at last over the indignant and irascible, and a flood of tears came seasonably to his assistance, and possibly prevented his misfortunes from either turning his head, or bursting his heart.
He grew, however, soon ashamed of indulging this remedy; and starting up, he cried, "Well, then, I will give Mr Allworthy the only instance he requires of my obedience. I will go this moment一but whither?一why, let Fortune direct; since there is no other who thinks it of any consequence what becomes of this wretched person, it shall be a matter of equal indifference to myself. Shall I alone regard what no other一Ha! have I not reason to think there is another?—one whose value is above
287
that of the whole world!一I may, I must imagine my Sophia is not indifferent to what becomes of me. Shall I then leave this only friend一and such a friend? Shall I not stay with her?一Where一how can I stay with her? Have I any hopes of ever seeing her, though she was as desirous as myself, without exposing her to the wrath of her father, and to what purpose? Can I think of soliciting such a creature to consent to her own ruin? Shall I indulge any passion of mine at such a price? Shall I lurk about this country like a thief, with such intentions?—No, I disdain, I detest the thought. Farewel, Sophia; farewel, most lovely, most beloved一" Here passion stopped his mouth, and found a vent at his eyes.
And now having taken a resolution to leave the country, he began to debate with himself whither he should go. The world, as Milton phrases it, lay all before him; and Jones, no more than Adam, had any man to whom he might resort for comfort or assistance. All his acquaintance were the acquaintance of Mr Allworthy; and he had no reason to expect any countenance from them, as that gentleman had withdrawn his favour from him. Men of great and good characters should indeed be very cautious how they discard their dependents; for the consequence to the unhappy sufferer is being discarded by all others.
What course of life to pursue, or to what business to apply himself, was a second consideration: and here the prospect was all a melancholy void. Every profession, and every trade, required length of time, and what was worse, money; for matters are so constituted, that "nothing out of nothing" is not a truer maxim in physics than in politics; and every man who is greatly destitute of money, is on that account entirely excluded from all means of acquiring it.
At last the Ocean, that hospitable friend to the wretched, opened her capacious arms to receive him; and he instantly resolved to accept her kind invitation. To express myself less figuratively, he determined to go to sea.
This thought indeed no sooner suggested itself, than he eagerly embraced it; and having presently hired horses, he set out for Bristol to put it in execution.
But before we attend him on this expedition, we shall resort awhile to Mr Western's, and see what further happened to the charming Sophia.

Chapter U
Containing several dialogues.
The morning in which Mr Jones departed, Mrs Western summoned Sophia into her apartment; and having first acquainted her that she had obtained her liberty of her father, she proceeded to read her a long lecture on the subject of matrimony; which she treated not as a romantic scheme of happiness arising from love, as it hath been described by the poets; nor did she mention any of those purposes for which we are taught by divines to regard it as instituted by sacred authority; she considered it rather as a fund in which prudent women deposit their fortunes to the best advantage, in order to receive a larger interest for them than they could have elsewhere.
When Mrs Western had finished, Sophia answered, "That she was very incapable of arguing with a lady of her aunt's superior knowledge and experience, especially on a subject which she had so very little considered, as this of matrimony."
"Argue with me, child!" replied the other; "I do not indeed expect it. I should have seen the world to very little purpose truly, if I am to argue with one of your years. I have taken this trouble, in order to instruct you. The antient philosophers, such as Socrates, Alcibiades, and others, did not use to argue with their scholars. You are to consider me, child, as Socrates, not asking your opinion, but only informing you of mine." From which last words the reader may possibly imagine, that this lady had read no more of the philosophy of Socrates, than she had of that of Al-cibiades; and indeed we cannot resolve his curiosity as to this point.
"Madam," cries Sophia, "I have never presumed to controvert any opinion of yours; and this subject, as I said, I have never yet thought of, and perhaps never may."
"Indeed, Sophy," replied the aunt, "this dissimulation with me is very foolish. The French shall as soon persuade me that they take foreign towns in defence only of their own country, as you can impose on me to

believe you have never yet thought seriously of matrimony. How can you, child, affect to deny that you have considered of contracting an alliance, when you so well know I am acquainted with the party with whom you desire to contract it?一an alliance as unnatural, and contrary to your interest, as a separate league with the French would be to the interest of the Dutch! But however, if you have not hitherto considered of this matter, I promise you it is now high time, for my brother is resolved immediately to conclude the treaty with Mr Blifil; and indeed I am a sort of guarantee in the affair, and have promised your concurrence."
"Indeed, madam," cries Sophia, "this is the only instance in which I must disobey both yourself and my father. For this is a match which requires very little consideration in me to refuse."
"If I was not as great a philosopher as Socrates himself," returned Mrs Western, "you would overcome my patience. What objection can you have to the young gentleman?"
"A very solid objection, in my opinion," says Sophia一"I hate him."
"Will you never learn a proper use of words?" answered the aunt. "Indeed, child, you should consult Bailey's Dictionary. It is impossible you should hate a man from whom you have received no injury. By hatred, therefore, you mean no more than dislike, which is no sufficient objection against your marrying of him. I have known many couples, who have entirely disliked each other, lead very comfortable genteel lives. Believe me, child, I know these things better than you. You will allow me, I think, to have seen the world, in which I have not an acquaintance who would not rather be thought to dislike her husband than to like him. The contrary is such out-of-fashion romantic nonsense, that the very imagination of it is shocking."
"Indeed, madam," replied Sophia, "I shall never marry a man I dislike. If I promise my father never to consent to any marriage contrary to his inclinations, I think I may hope he will never force me into that state contrary to my own."
"Inclinations!" cries the aunt, with some warmth. "Inclinations! I am astonished at your assurance. A young woman of your age, and unmarried, to talk of inclinations! But whatever your inclinations may be, my brother is resolved; nay, since you talk of inclinations, I shall advise him to hasten the treaty. Inclinations!"
Sophia then flung herself upon her knees, and tears began to trickle from her shining eyes. She entreated her aunt, "to have mercy upon her, and not to resent so cruelly her unwillingness to make herself miserable;"
290
often urging, "that she alone was concerned, and that her happiness only was at stake."
As a bailiff, when well authorized by his writ, having possessed himself of the person of some unhappy debtor, views all his tears without concern; in vain the wretched captive attempts to raise compassion; in vain the tender wife bereft of her companion, the little prattling boy, or frighted girl, are mentioned as inducements to reluctance. The noble bumtrap, blind and deaf to every circumstance of distress, greatly rises above all the motives to humanity, and into the hands of the gaoler resolves to deliver his miserable prey.
Not less blind to the tears, or less deaf to every entreaty of Sophia was the politic aunt, nor less determined was she to deliver over the trembling maid into the arms of the gaoler Blifil. She answered with great impetuosity, "So far, madam, from your being concerned alone, your concern is the least, or surely the least important. It is the honour of your family which is concerned in this alliance; you are only the instrument. Do you conceive, mistress, that in an intermarriage between kingdoms, as when a daughter of France is married into Spain, the princess herself is alone considered in the match? No! it is a match between two kingdoms, rather than between two persons. The same happens in great families such as ours. The alliance between the families is the principal matter. You ought to have a greater regard for the honour of your family than for your own person; and if the example of a princess cannot inspire you with these noble thoughts, you cannot surely complain at being used no worse than all princesses are used."
"I hope, madam," cries Sophia, with a little elevation of voice, "I shall never do anything to dishonour my family; but as for Mr Blifil, whatever may be the consequence, I am resolved against him, and no force shall prevail in his favour."
Western, who had been within hearing during the greater part of the preceding dialogue, had now exhausted all his patience; he therefore entered the room in a violent passion, crying, "D一n me then if shatunt ha'un, d一n me if shatunt, that's all一that's all; d一n me if shatunt."
Mrs Western had collected a sufficient quantity of wrath for the use of Sophia; but she now transferred it all to the squire. "Brother," said she, "it is astonishing that you will interfere in a matter which you had totally left to my negotiation. Regard to my family hath made me take upon myself to be the mediating power, in order to rectify those mistakes in policy which you have committed in your daughter's education. For,
291
brother, it is you—it is your preposterous conduct which hath eradicated all the seeds that I had formerly sown in her tender mind. It is you yourself who have taught her disobedience."一"Blood!" cries the squire, foaming at the mouth, "you are enough to conquer the patience of the devil! Have I ever taught my daughter disobedience?一Here she stands; speak honestly, girl, did ever I bid you be disobedient to me? Have not I done everything to humour and to gratify you, and to make you obedient to me? And very obedient to me she was when a little child, before you took her in hand and spoiled her, by filling her head with a pack of court notions. Why一why一why一did I not overhear you telling her she must behave like a princess? You have made a Whig of the girl; and how should her father, or anybody else, expect any obedience from her?"一"Brother," answered Mrs Western, with an air of great disdain, "I cannot express the contempt I have for your politics of all kinds; but I will appeal likewise to the young lady herself, whether I have ever taught her any principles of disobedience. On the contrary, niece, have I not endeavoured to inspire you with a true idea of the several relations in which a human creature stands in society? Have I not taken infinite pains to show you, that the law of nature hath enjoined a duty on children to their parents? Have I not told you what Plato says on that subject?一a subject on which you was so notoriously ignorant when you came first under my care, that I verily believe you did not know the relation between a daughter and a father."一"'Tis a lie," answered Western. "The girl is no such fool, as to live to eleven years old without knowing that she was her father's relation."一"O! more than Gothic ignorance," answered the lady. "And as for your manners, brother, I must tell you, they deserve a cane."一"Why then you may gi' it me, if you think you are able," cries the squire; "nay, I suppose your niece there will be ready enough to help you."一"Brother," said Mrs Western, "though I despise you beyond expression, yet I shall endure your insolence no longer; so I desire my coach may be got ready immediately, for I am resolved to leave your house this very morning."一"And a good riddance too," answered he; "I can bear your insolence no longer, an you come to that. Blood! it is almost enough of itself to make my daughter undervalue my sense, when she hears you telling me every minute you despise me."一"It is impossible, it is impossible," cries the aunt; "no one can undervalue such a boor."一"Boar," answered the squire, "I am no boar; no, nor ass; no, nor rat neither, madam. Remember that一I am no rat. I am a true Englishman, and not of your Hanover breed, that have eat up the nation."—"Thou art one of those wise men," cries she, "whose nonsensical
292
principles have undone the nation; by weakening the hands of our government at home, and by discouraging our friends and encouraging our enemies abroad."一"Ho! are you come back to your politics?" cries the squire: "as for those I despise them as much as I do a f一t." Which last words he accompanied and graced with the very action, which, of all others, was the most proper to it. And whether it was this word or the contempt exprest for her politics, which most affected Mrs Western, I will not determine; but she flew into the most violent rage, uttered phrases improper to be here related, and instantly burst out of the house. Nor did her brother or her niece think proper either to stop or to follow her; for the one was so much possessed by concern, and the other by anger, that they were rendered almost motionless.
The squire, however, sent after his sister the same holloa which attends the departure of a hare, when she is first started before the hounds. He was indeed a great master of this kind of vociferation, and had a holla proper for most occasions in life.
Women who, like Mrs Western, know the world, and have applied themselves to philosophy and politics, would have immediately availed themselves of the present disposition of Mr Western's mind, by throwing in a few artful compliments to his understanding at the expense of his absent adversary; but poor Sophia was all simplicity. By which word we do not intend to insinuate to the reader, that she was silly, which is generally understood as a synonymous term with simple; for she was indeed a most sensible girl, and her understanding was of the first rate; but she wanted all that useful art which females convert to so many good purposes in life, and which, as it rather arises from the heart than from the head, is often the property of the silliest of women.
293
A picture of a country gentlewoman taken from the life.
Mr Western having finished his holla, and taken a little breath, began to lament, in very pathetic terms, the unfortunate condition of men, who are, says he, "always whipt in by the humours of some d一n'd b一 or other. I think I was hard run enough by your mother for one man; but after giving her a dodge, here's another b— follows me upon the foil; but curse my jacket if I will be run down in this manner by any o'um."
Sophia never had a single dispute with her father, till this unlucky affair of Blifil, on any account, except in defence of her mother, whom she had loved most tenderly, though she lost her in the eleventh year of her age. The squire, to whom that poor woman had been a faithful upperservant all the time of their marriage, had returned that behaviour by making what the world calls a good husband. He very seldom swore at her (perhaps not above once a week) and never beat her; she had not the least occasion for jealousy, and was perfect mistress of her time; for she was never interrupted by her husband, who was engaged all the morning in his field exercises, and all the evening with bottle companions. She scarce indeed ever saw him but at meals; where she had the pleasure of carving those dishes which she had before attended at the dressing. From these meals she retired about five minutes after the other servants, having only stayed to drink "the king over the water." Such were, it seems, Mr Western's orders; for it was a maxim with him, that women should come in with the first dish, and go out after the first glass. Obedience to these orders was perhaps no difficult task; for the conversation (if it may be called so) was seldom such as could entertain a lady. It consisted chiefly of hallowing, singing, relations of sporting adventures, b—d—y, and abuse of women, and of the government.
These, however, were the only seasons when Mr Western saw his wife; for when he repaired to her bed, he was generally so drunk that he could not see; and in the sporting season he always rose from her before it was light. Thus was she perfect mistress of her time, and had besides a coach
294
and four usually at her command; though unhappily, indeed, the badness of the neighbourhood, and of the roads, made this of little use; for none who had set much value on their necks would have passed through the one, or who had set any value on their hours, would have visited the other. Now to deal honestly with the reader, she did not make all the return expected to so much indulgence; for she had been married against her will by a fond father, the match having been rather advantageous on her side; for the squire's estate was upward of £3000 a year, and her fortune no more than a bare £8000. Hence perhaps she had contracted a little gloominess of temper, for she was rather a good servant than a good wife; nor had she always the gratitude to return the extraordinary degree of roaring mirth, with which the squire received her, even with a good-humoured smile. She would, moreover, sometimes interfere with matters which did not concern her, as the violent drinking of her husband, which in the gentlest terms she would take some of the few opportunities he gave her of remonstrating against. And once in her life she very earnestly entreated him to carry her for two months to London, which he peremptorily denied; nay, was angry with his wife for the request ever after, being well assured that all the husbands in London are cuckolds.
For this last, and many other good reasons, Western at length heartily hated his wife; and as he never concealed this hatred before her death, so he never forgot it afterwards; but when anything in the least soured him, as a bad scenting day, or a distemper among his hounds, or any other such misfortune, he constantly vented his spleen by invectives against the deceased, saying, "If my wife was alive now, she would be glad of this."
These invectives he was especially desirous of throwing forth before Sophia; for as he loved her more than he did any other, so he was really jealous that she had loved her mother better than him. And this jealousy Sophia seldom failed of heightening on these occasions; for he was not contented with violating her ears with the abuse of her mother, but endeavoured to force an explicit approbation of all this abuse; with which desire he never could prevail upon her by any promise or threats to comply.
Hence some of my readers will, perhaps, wonder that the squire had not hated Sophia as much as he had hated her mother; but I must inform them, that hatred is not the effect of love, even through the medium of jealousy. It is, indeed, very possible for jealous persons to kill the objects of their jealousy, but not to hate them. Which sentiment being a pretty
295
hard morsel, and bearing something of the air of a paradox, we shall leave the reader to chew the cud upon it to the end of the chapter.

Chapter U
The generous behaviour of Sophia towards her aunt.
Sophia kept silence during the foregoing speech of her father, nor did she once answer otherwise than with a sigh; but as he understood none of the language, or, as he called it, lingo of the eyes, so he was not satisfied without some further approbation of his sentiments, which he now demanded of his daughter; telling her, in the usual way, "he expected she was ready to take the part of everybody against him, as she had always done that of the b— her mother." Sophia remaining still silent, he cryed out, "What, art dumb? why dost unt speak? Was not thy mother a d—d b— to me? answer me that. What, I suppose you despise your father too, and don't think him good enough to speak to?"
"For Heaven's sake, sir," answered Sophia, "do not give so cruel a turn to my silence. I am sure I would sooner die than be guilty of any disrespect towards you; but how can I venture to speak, when every word must either offend my dear papa, or convict me of the blackest ingratitude as well as impiety to the memory of the best of mothers; for such, I am certain, my mamma was always to me?"
"And your aunt, I suppose, is the best of sisters too!" replied the squire. "Will you be so kind as to allow that she is a b—? I may fairly insist upon that, I think?"
"Indeed, sir," says Sophia, "I have great obligations to my aunt. She hath been a second mother to me."
"And a second wife to me too," returned Western; "so you will take her part too! You won't confess that she hath acted the part of the vilest sister in the world?"
"Upon my word, sir," cries Sophia, "I must belie my heart wickedly if I did. I know my aunt and you differ very much in your ways of thinking; but I have heard her a thousand times express the greatest affection for you; and I am convinced, so far from her being the worst sister in the world, there are very few who love a brother better."
297
"The English of all which is," answered the squire, "that I am in the wrong. Ay, certainly. Ay, to be sure the woman is in the right, and the man in the wrong always."
"Pardon me, sir," cries Sophia. "I do not say so."
"What don't you say?" answered the father: "you have the impudence to say she's in the right: doth it not follow then of course that I am in the wrong? And perhaps I am in the wrong to suffer such a Presbyterian Hanoverian b一 to come into my house. She may 'dite me of a plot for anything I know, and give my estate to the government."
"So far, sir, from injuring you or your estate," says Sophia, "if my aunt had died yesterday, I am convinced she would have left you her whole fortune."
Whether Sophia intended it or no, I shall not presume to assert; but certain it is, these last words penetrated very deep into the ears of her father, and produced a much more sensible effect than all she had said before. He received the sound with much the same action as a man receives a bullet in his head. He started, staggered, and turned pale. After which he remained silent above a minute, and then began in the following hesitating manner: "Yesterday! she would have left me her esteate yesterday! would she? Why yesterday, of all the days in the year? I suppose if she dies to-morrow, she will leave it to somebody else, and perhaps out of the vamily."一"My aunt, sir," cries Sophia, "hath very violent passions, and I can't answer what she may do under their influence."
"You can't!" returned the father: "and pray who hath been the occasion of putting her into those violent passions? Nay, who hath actually put her into them? Was not you and she hard at it before I came into the room? Besides, was not all our quarrel about you? I have not quarrelled with sister this many years but upon your account; and now you would throw the whole blame upon me, as thof I should be the occasion of her leaving the esteate out o' the vamily. I could have expected no better indeed; this is like the return you make to all the rest of my fondness."
"I beseech you then," cries Sophia, "upon my knees I beseech you, if I have been the unhappy occasion of this difference, that you will endeavour to make it up with my aunt, and not suffer her to leave your house in this violent rage of anger: she is a very good-natured woman, and a few civil words will satisfy her. Let me entreat you, sir."
"So I must go and ask pardon for your fault, must I?" answered Western. "You have lost the hare, and I must draw every way to find her again? Indeed, if I was certain"一Here he stopt, and Sophia throwing in
298
more entreaties, at length prevailed upon him; so that after venting two or three bitter sarcastical expressions against his daughter, he departed as fast as he could to recover his sister, before her equipage could be gotten ready.
Sophia then returned to her chamber of mourning, where she indulged herself (if the phrase may be allowed me) in all the luxury of tender grief. She read over more than once the letter which she had received from Jones; her muff too was used on this occasion; and she bathed both these, as well as herself, with her tears. In this situation the friendly Mrs Honour exerted her utmost abilities to comfort her afflicted mistress. She ran over the names of many young gentlemen: and having greatly commended their parts and persons, assured Sophia that she might take her choice of any. These methods must have certainly been used with some success in disorders of the like kind, or so skilful a practitioner as Mrs Honour would never have ventured to apply them; nay, I have heard that the college of chambermaids hold them to be as sovereign remedies as any in the female dispensary; but whether it was that Sophia's disease differed inwardly from those cases with which it agreed in external symptoms, I will not assert; but, in fact, the good waiting-woman did more harm than good, and at last so incensed her mistress (which was no easy matter) that with an angry voice she dismissed her from her presence.

Containing great variety of matter.
The squire overtook his sister just as she was stepping into the coach, and partly by force, and partly by solicitations, prevailed upon her to order her horses back into their quarters. He succeeded in this attempt without much difficulty; for the lady was, as we have already hinted, of a most placable disposition, and greatly loved her brother, though she despised his parts, or rather his little knowledge of the world.
Poor Sophia, who had first set on foot this reconciliation, was now made the sacrifice to it. They both concurred in their censures on her conduct; jointly declared war against her, and directly proceeded to counsel, how to carry it on in the most vigorous manner. For this purpose, Mrs Western proposed not only an immediate conclusion of the treaty with Allworthy, but as immediately to carry it into execution; saying, "That there was no other way to succeed with her niece, but by violent methods, which she was convinced Sophia had not sufficient resolution to resist. By violent," says she, "I mean rather, hasty measures; for as to confinement or absolute force, no such things must or can be attempted. Our plan must be concerted for a surprize, and not for a storm."
These matters were resolved on, when Mr Blifil came to pay a visit to his mistress. The squire no sooner heard of his arrival, than he stept aside, by his sister's advice, to give his daughter orders for the proper reception of her lover: which he did with the most bitter execrations and denunciations of judgment on her refusal.
The impetuosity of the squire bore down all before him; and Sophia, as her aunt very wisely foresaw, was not able to resist him. She agreed, therefore, to see Blifil, though she had scarce spirits or strength sufficient to utter her assent. Indeed, to give a peremptory denial to a father whom she so tenderly loved, was no easy task. Had this circumstance been out of the case, much less resolution than what she was really mistress of, would, perhaps, have served her; but it is no unusual thing to ascribe
300
those actions entirely to fear, which are in a great measure produced by love.
In pursuance, therefore, of her father's peremptory command, Sophia now admitted Mr Blifil's visit. Scenes like this, when painted at large, afford, as we have observed, very little entertainment to the reader. Here, therefore, we shall strictly adhere to a rule of Horace; by which writers are directed to pass over all those matters which they despair of placing in a shining light;一a rule, we conceive, of excellent use as well to the historian as to the poet; and which, if followed, must at least have this good effect, that many a great evil (for so all great books are called) would thus be reduced to a small one.
It is possible the great art used by Blifil at this interview would have prevailed on Sophia to have made another man in his circumstances her confident, and to have revealed the whole secret of her heart to him; but she had contracted so ill an opinion of this young gentleman, that she was resolved to place no confidence in him; for simplicity, when set on its guard, is often a match for cunning. Her behaviour to him, therefore, was entirely forced, and indeed such as is generally prescribed to virgins upon the second formal visit from one who is appointed for their husband.
But though Blifil declared himself to the squire perfectly satisfied with his reception; yet that gentleman, who, in company with his sister, had overheard all, was not so well pleased. He resolved, in pursuance of the advice of the sage lady, to push matters as forward as possible; and addressing himself to his intended son-in-law in the hunting phrase, he cried, after a loud holla, "Follow her, boy, follow her; run in, run in; that's it, honeys. Dead, dead, dead. Never be bashful, nor stand shall I, shall I? Allworthy and I can finish all matters between us this afternoon, and let us ha' the wedding to-morrow."
Blifil having conveyed the utmost satisfaction into his countenance, answered, "As there is nothing, sir, in this world which I so eagerly desire as an alliance with your family, except my union with the most amiable and deserving Sophia, you may easily imagine how impatient I must be to see myself in possession of my two highest wishes. If I have not therefore importuned you on this head, you will impute it only to my fear of offending the lady, by endeavouring to hurry on so blessed an event faster than a strict compliance with all the rules of decency and decorum will permit. But if, by your interest, sir, she might be induced to dispense with any formalities一"
301
"Formalities! with a pox!" answered the squire. "Pooh, all stuff and nonsense! I tell thee, she shall ha' thee to-morrow: you will know the world better hereafter, when you come to my age. Women never gi' their consent, man, if they can help it, 'tis not the fashion. If I had stayed for her mother's consent, I might have been a batchelor to this day.一To her, to her, co to her, that's it, you jolly dog. I tell thee shat ha' her to-morrow morning."
Blifil suffered himself to be overpowered by the forcible rhetoric of the squire; and it being agreed that Western should close with Allworthy that very afternoon, the lover departed home, having first earnestly begged that no violence might be offered to the lady by this haste, in the same manner as a popish inquisitor begs the lay power to do no violence to the heretic delivered over to it, and against whom the church hath passed sentence.
And, to say the truth, Blifil had passed sentence against Sophia; for, however pleased he had declared himself to Western with his reception, he was by no means satisfied, unless it was that he was convinced of the hatred and scorn of his mistress: and this had produced no less reciprocal hatred and scorn in him. It may, perhaps, be asked, Why then did he not put an immediate end to all further courtship? I answer, for that very reason, as well as for several others equally good, which we shall now proceed to open to the reader.
Though Mr Blifil was not of the complexion of Jones, nor ready to eat every woman he saw; yet he was far from being destitute of that appetite which is said to be the common property of all animals. With this, he had likewise that distinguishing taste, which serves to direct men in their choice of the object or food of their several appetites; and this taught him to consider Sophia as a most delicious morsel, indeed to regard her with the same desires which an ortolan inspires into the soul of an epicure. Now the agonies which affected the mind of Sophia, rather augmented than impaired her beauty; for her tears added brightness to her eyes, and her breasts rose higher with her sighs. Indeed, no one hath seen beauty in its highest lustre who hath never seen it in distress. Blifil therefore looked on this human ortolan with greater desire than when he viewed her last; nor was his desire at all lessened by the aversion which he discovered in her to himself. On the contrary, this served rather to heighten the pleasure he proposed in rifling her charms, as it added triumph to lust; nay, he had some further views, from obtaining the absolute possession of her person, which we detest too much even to mention; and revenge itself was not without its share in the gratifications which he
302
promised himself. The rivalling poor Jones, and supplanting him in her affections, added another spur to his pursuit, and promised another additional rapture to his enjoyment.
Besides all these views, which to some scrupulous persons may seem to savour too much of malevolence, he had one prospect, which few readers will regard with any great abhorrence. And this was the estate of Mr Western; which was all to be settled on his daughter and her issue; for so extravagant was the affection of that fond parent, that, provided his child would but consent to be miserable with the husband he chose, he cared not at what price he purchased him.
For these reasons Mr Blifil was so desirous of the match that he intended to deceive Sophia, by pretending love to her; and to deceive her father and his own uncle, by pretending he was beloved by her. In doing this he availed himself of the piety of Thwackum, who held, that if the end proposed was religious (as surely matrimony is), it mattered not how wicked were the means. As to other occasions, he used to apply the philosophy of Square, which taught, that the end was immaterial, so that the means were fair and consistent with moral rectitude. To say truth, there were few occurrences in life on which he could not draw advantage from the precepts of one or other of those great masters.
Little deceit was indeed necessary to be practised on Mr Western; who thought the inclinations of his daughter of as little consequence as Blifil himself conceived them to be; but as the sentiments of Mr Allworthy were of a very different kind, so it was absolutely necessary to impose on him. In this, however, Blifil was so well assisted by Western, that he succeeded without difficulty; for as Mr Allworthy had been assured by her father that Sophia had a proper affection for Blifil, and that all which he had suspected concerning Jones was entirely false, Blifil had nothing more to do than to confirm these assertions; which he did with such equivocations, that he preserved a salvo for his conscience; and had the satisfaction of conveying a lie to his uncle, without the guilt of telling one. When he was examined touching the inclinations of Sophia by Allworthy, who said, "He would on no account be accessary to forcing a young lady into a marriage contrary to her own will;" he answered, "That the real sentiments of young ladies were very difficult to be understood; that her behaviour to him was full as forward as he wished it, and that if he could believe her father, she had all the affection for him which any lover could desire. As for Jones," said he, "whom I am loth to call villain, though his behaviour to you, sir, sufficiently justifies the appellation, his own vanity, or perhaps some wicked views, might make him
303
boast of a falsehood; for if there had been any reality in Miss Western's love to him, the greatness of her fortune would never have suffered him to desert her, as you are well informed he hath. Lastly, sir, I promise you I would not myself, for any consideration, no, not for the whole world, consent to marry this young lady, if I was not persuaded she had all the passion for me which I desire she should have."
This excellent method of conveying a falsehood with the heart only, without making the tongue guilty of an untruth, by the means of equivocation and imposture, hath quieted the conscience of many a notable deceiver; and yet, when we consider that it is Omniscience on which these endeavour to impose, it may possibly seem capable of affording only a very superficial comfort; and that this artful and refined distinction between communicating a lie, and telling one, is hardly worth the pains it costs them.
Allworthy was pretty well satisfied with what Mr Western and Mr Bli-fil told him: and the treaty was now, at the end of two days, concluded. Nothing then remained previous to the office of the priest, but the office of the lawyers, which threatened to take up so much time, that Western offered to bind himself by all manner of covenants, rather than defer the happiness of the young couple. Indeed, he was so very earnest and pressing, that an indifferent person might have concluded he was more a principal in this match than he really was; but this eagerness was natural to him on all occasions: and he conducted every scheme he undertook in such a manner, as if the success of that alone was sufficient to constitute the whole happiness of his life.
The joint importunities of both father and son-in-law would probably have prevailed on Mr Allworthy, who brooked but ill any delay of giving happiness to others, had not Sophia herself prevented it, and taken measures to put a final end to the whole treaty, and to rob both church and law of those taxes which these wise bodies have thought proper to receive from the propagation of the human species in a lawful manner. Of which in the next chapter.

A strange resolution of Sophia, and a more strange stratagem of Mrs Honour.
Though Mrs Honour was principally attached to her own interest, she was not without some little attachment to Sophia. To say truth, it was very difficult for any one to know that young lady without loving her. She no sooner therefore heard a piece of news, which she imagined to be of great importance to her mistress, than, quite forgetting the anger which she had conceived two days before, at her unpleasant dismission from Sophia's presence, she ran hastily to inform her of the news.
The beginning of her discourse was as abrupt as her entrance into the room. "O dear ma'am!" says she, "what doth your la'ship think? To be sure I am frightened out of my wits; and yet I thought it my duty to tell your la'ship, though perhaps it may make you angry, for we servants don't always know what will make our ladies angry; for, to be sure, everything is always laid to the charge of a servant. When our ladies are out of humour, to be sure we must be scolded; and to be sure I should not wonder if your la'ship should be out of humour; nay, it must surprize you certainly, ay, and shock you too."一"Good Honour, let me know it without any longer preface," says Sophia; "there are few things, I promise you, which will surprize, and fewer which will shock me."一"Dear ma'am," answered Honour, "to be sure, I overheard my master talking to parson Supple about getting a licence this very afternoon; and to be sure I heard him say, your la'ship should be married tomorrow morning." Sophia turned pale at these words, and repeated eagerly, "To-morrow morning!"一"Yes, ma'am," replied the trusty waiting-woman, "I will take my oath I heard my master say so."一"Honour," says Sophia, "you have both surprized and shocked me to such a degree that I have scarce any breath or spirits left. What is to be done in my dreadful situation?"一"I wish I was able to advise your la'ship," says she. "Do advise me," cries Sophia; "pray, dear Honour, advise me. Think what you would attempt if it was your own
305
case."一"Indeed, ma'am," cries Honour, "I wish your la'ship and I could change situations; that is, I mean without hurting your la'ship; for to be sure I don't wish you so bad as to be a servant; but because that if so be it was my case, I should find no manner of difficulty in it; for, in my poor opinion, young Squire Blifil is a charming, sweet, handsome man."—"Don't mention such stuff," cries Sophia. "Such stuff!" repeated Honour; "why, there. Well, to be sure, what's one man's meat is another man's poison, and the same is altogether as true of women."一"Honour," says Sophia, "rather than submit to be the wife of that contemptible wretch, I would plunge a dagger into my heart."一"O lud! ma'am!" answered the other, "I am sure you frighten me out of my wits now. Let me beseech your la'ship not to suffer such wicked thoughts to come into your head. O lud! to be sure I tremble every inch of me. Dear ma'am, consider, that to be denied Christian burial, and to have your corpse buried in the highway, and a stake drove through you, as farmer Halfpenny was served at Ox Cross; and, to be sure, his ghost hath walked there ever since, for several people have seen him. To be sure it can be nothing but the devil which can put such wicked thoughts into the head of anybody; for certainly it is less wicked to hurt all the world than one's own dear self; and so I have heard said by more parsons than one. If your la'ship hath such a violent aversion, and hates the young gentleman so very bad, that you can't bear to think of going into bed to him; for to be sure there may be such antipathies in nature, and one had lieverer touch a toad than the flesh of some people."一
Sophia had been too much wrapt in contemplation to pay any great attention to the foregoing excellent discourse of her maid; interrupting her therefore, without making any answer to it, she said, "Honour, I am come to a resolution. I am determined to leave my father's house this very night; and if you have the friendship for me which you have often professed, you will keep me company."—"That I will, ma'am, to the world's end," answered Honour; "but I beg your la'ship to consider the consequence before you undertake any rash action. Where can your la'ship possibly go?"一"There is," replied Sophia, "a lady of quality in London, a relation of mine, who spent several months with my aunt in the country; during all which time she treated me with great kindness, and expressed so much pleasure in my company, that she earnestly desired my aunt to suffer me to go with her to London. As she is a woman of very great note, I shall easily find her out, and I make no doubt of being very well and kindly received by her."一"I would not have your la'ship too confident of that," cries Honour; "for the first lady I lived with
306
used to invite people very earnestly to her house; but if she heard afterwards they were coming, she used to get out of the way. Besides, though this lady would be very glad to see your la'ship, as to be sure anybody would be glad to see your la'ship, yet when she hears your la'ship is run away from my master一" "You are mistaken, Honour," says Sophia: "she looks upon the authority of a father in a much lower light than I do; for she pressed me violently to go to London with her, and when I refused to go without my father's consent, she laughed me to scorn, called me silly country girl, and said, I should make a pure loving wife, since I could be so dutiful a daughter. So I have no doubt but she will both receive me and protect me too, till my father, finding me out of his power, can be brought to some reason."
"Well, but, ma'am," answered Honour, "how doth your la'ship think of making your escape? Where will you get any horses or conveyance? For as for your own horse, as all the servants know a little how matters stand between my master and your la'ship, Robin will be hanged before he will suffer it to go out of the stable without my master's express orders." "I intend to escape," said Sophia, "by walking out of the doors when they are open. I thank Heaven my legs are very able to carry me. They have supported me many a long evening"一"Yes, to be sure," cries Honour, "I will follow your la'ship through the world; but your la'ship had almost as good be alone: for I should not be able to defend you, if any robbers, or other villains, should meet with you. Nay, I should be in as horrible a fright as your la'ship; for to be certain, they would ravish us both. Besides, ma'am, consider how cold the nights are now; we shall be frozen to death."一"A good brisk pace," answered Sophia, "will preserve us from the cold; and if you cannot defend me from a villain, Honour, I will defend you; for I will take a pistol with me. There are two always charged in the hall."一"Dear ma'am, you frighten me more and more," cries Honour: "sure your la'ship would not venture to fire it off! I had rather run any chance than your la'ship should do that."一"Why so?" says Sophia, smiling; "would not you, Honour, fire a pistol at any one who should attack your virtue?"一"To be sure, ma'am," cries Honour, "one's virtue is a dear thing, especially to us poor servants; for it is our livelihood, as a body may say: yet I mortally hate fire-arms; for so many accidents happen by them."一"Well, well," says Sophia, "I believe I may ensure your virtue at a very cheap rate, without carrying any arms with us; for I intend to take horses at the very first town we come to, and we shall hardly be attacked in our way thither. Look'ee, Honour, I am
307
resolved to go; and if you will attend me, I promise you I will reward you to the very utmost of my power."
This last argument had a stronger effect on Honour than all the preceding. And since she saw her mistress so determined, she desisted from any further dissuasions. They then entered into a debate on ways and means of executing their project. Here a very stubborn difficulty occurred, and this was the removal of their effects, which was much more easily got over by the mistress than by the maid; for when a lady hath once taken a resolution to run to a lover, or to run from him, all obstacles are considered as trifles. But Honour was inspired by no such motive; she had no raptures to expect, nor any terrors to shun; and besides the real value of her clothes, in which consisted a great part of her fortune, she had a capricious fondness for several gowns, and other things; either because they became her, or because they were given her by such a particular person; because she had bought them lately, or because she had had them long; or for some other reasons equally good; so that she could not endure the thoughts of leaving the poor things behind her exposed to the mercy of Western, who, she doubted not, would in his rage make them suffer martyrdom.
The ingenious Mrs Honour having applied all her oratory to dissuade her mistress from her purpose, when she found her positively determined, at last started the following expedient to remove her clothes, viz., to get herself turned out of doors that very evening. Sophia highly approved this method, but doubted how it might be brought about. "O, ma'am," cries Honour, "your la'ship may trust that to me; we servants very well know how to obtain this favour of our masters and mistresses; though sometimes, indeed, where they owe us more wages than they can readily pay, they will put up with all our affronts, and will hardly take any warning we can give them; but the squire is none of those; and since your la'ship is resolved upon setting out to-night, I warrant I get discharged this afternoon." It was then resolved that she should pack up some linen and a night-gown for Sophia, with her own things; and as for all her other clothes, the young lady abandoned them with no more remorse than the sailor feels when he throws over the goods of others, in order to save his own life.

Chapter V?
Containing scenes of altercation, of no very uncommon kind.
Mrs Honour had scarce sooner parted from her young lady, than something (for I would not, like the old woman in Quevedo, injure the devil by any false accusation, and possibly he might have no hand in it)—but something, I say, suggested itself to her, that by sacrificing Sophia and all her secrets to Mr Western, she might probably make her fortune. Many considerations urged this discovery. The fair prospect of a handsome reward for so great and acceptable a service to the squire, tempted her avarice; and again, the danger of the enterprize she had undertaken; the uncertainty of its success; night, cold, robbers, ravishers, all alarmed her fears. So forcibly did all these operate upon her, that she was almost determined to go directly to the squire, and to lay open the whole affair. She was, however, too upright a judge to decree on one side, before she had heard the other. And here, first, a journey to London appeared very strongly in support of Sophia. She eagerly longed to see a place in which she fancied charms short only of those which a raptured saint imagines in heaven. In the next place, as she knew Sophia to have much more generosity than her master, so her fidelity promised her a greater reward than she could gain by treachery. She then cross-examined all the articles which had raised her fears on the other side, and found, on fairly sifting the matter, that there was very little in them. And now both scales being reduced to a pretty even balance, her love to her mistress being thrown into the scale of her integrity, made that rather preponderate, when a circumstance struck upon her imagination which might have had a dangerous effect, had its whole weight been fairly put into the other scale. This was the length of time which must intervene before Sophia would be able to fulfil her promises; for though she was intitled to her mother's fortune at the death of her father, and to the sum of £3000 left her by an uncle when she came of age; yet these were distant days, and many accidents might prevent the intended generosity of the young lady; whereas the rewards she might expect from Mr Western
309
were immediate. But while she was pursuing this thought the good genius of Sophia, or that which presided over the integrity of Mrs Honour, or perhaps mere chance, sent an accident in her way, which at once preserved her fidelity, and even facilitated the intended business.
Mrs Western's maid claimed great superiority over Mrs Honour on several accounts. First, her birth was higher; for her great-grandmother by the mother's side was a cousin, not far removed, to an Irish peer. Secondly, her wages were greater. And lastly, she had been at London, and had of consequence seen more of the world. She had always behaved, therefore, to Mrs Honour with that reserve, and had always exacted of her those marks of distinction, which every order of females preserves and requires in conversation with those of an inferior order. Now as Honour did not at all times agree with this doctrine, but would frequently break in upon the respect which the other demanded, Mrs Western's maid was not at all pleased with her company; indeed, she earnestly longed to return home to the house of her mistress, where she domineered at will over all the other servants. She had been greatly, therefore, disappointed in the morning, when Mrs Western had changed her mind on the very point of departure; and had been in what is vulgarly called a glouting humour ever since.
In this humour, which was none of the sweetest, she came into the room where Honour was debating with herself in the manner we have above related. Honour no sooner saw her, than she addressed her in the following obliging phrase: "Soh, madam, I find we are to have the pleasure of your company longer, which I was afraid the quarrel between my master and your lady would have robbed us of."一"I don't know, madam," answered the other, "what you mean by we and us. I assure you I do not look on any of the servants in this house to be proper company for me. I am company, I hope, for their betters every day in the week. I do not speak on your account, Mrs Honour; for you are a civilized young woman; and when you have seen a little more of the world, I should not be ashamed to walk with you in St James's Park."一"Hoity toity!" cries Honour, "madam is in her airs, I protest. Mrs Honour, forsooth! sure, madam, you might call me by my sir-name; for though my lady calls me Honour, I have a sir-name as well as other folks. Ashamed to walk with me, quotha! marry, as good as yourself, I hope."一"Since you make such a return to my civility," said the other, "I must acquaint you, Mrs Honour, that you are not so good as me. In the country, indeed, one is obliged to take up with all kind of trumpery; but in town I visit none but the women of women of quality. Indeed, Mrs Honour, there is
310
some difference, I hope, between you and me."一"I hope so too," answered Honour: "there is some difference in our ages, and一I think in our persons." Upon speaking which last words, she strutted by Mrs Western's maid with the most provoking air of contempt; turning up her nose, tossing her head, and violently brushing the hoop of her competitor with her own. The other lady put on one of her most malicious sneers, and said, "Creature! you are below my anger; and it is beneath me to give ill words to such an audacious saucy trollop; but, hussy, I must tell you, your breeding shows the meanness of your birth as well as of your education; and both very properly qualify you to be the mean servingwoman of a country girl."—"Don't abuse my lady," cries Honour: "I won't take that of you; she's as much better than yours as she is younger, and ten thousand times more handsomer."
Here ill luck, or rather good luck, sent Mrs Western to see her maid in tears, which began to flow plentifully at her approach; and of which being asked the reason by her mistress, she presently acquainted her that her tears were occasioned by the rude treatment of that creature there—meaning Honour. "And, madam," continued she, "I could have despised all she said to me; but she hath had the audacity to affront your ladyship, and to call you ugly一Yes, madam, she called you ugly old cat to my face. I could not bear to hear your ladyship called ugly."一"Why do you repeat her impudence so often?" said Mrs Western. And then turning to Mrs Honour, she asked her "How she had the assurance to mention her name with disrespect?"一"Disrespect, madam!" answered Honour; "I never mentioned your name at all: I said somebody was not as handsome as my mistress, and to be sure you know that as well as I."一"Hussy," replied the lady, "I will make such a saucy trollop as yourself know that I am not a proper subject of your discourse. And if my brother doth not discharge you this moment, I will never sleep in his house again. I will find him out, and have you discharged this mo-ment."一"Discharged!" cries Honour; "and suppose I am: there are more places in the world than one. Thank Heaven, good servants need not want places; and if you turn away all who do not think you handsome, you will want servants very soon; let me tell you that."
Mrs Western spoke, or rather thundered, in answer; but as she was hardly articulate, we cannot be very certain of the identical words; we shall therefore omit inserting a speech which at best would not greatly redound to her honour. She then departed in search of her brother, with a countenance so full of rage, that she resembled one of the furies rather than a human creature.
311
The two chambermaids being again left alone, began a second bout at altercation, which soon produced a combat of a more active kind. In this the victory belonged to the lady of inferior rank, but not without some loss of blood, of hair, and of lawn and muslin.

Chapter J
The wise demeanour of Mr Western in the character of a magistrate. A hint to justices of peace, concerning the necessary qualifications of a clerk; with extraordinary instances of paternal madness and filial affection.
Logicians sometimes prove too much by an argument, and politicians often overreach themselves in a scheme. Thus had it like to have happened to Mrs Honour, who, instead of recovering the rest of her clothes, had like to have stopped even those she had on her back from escaping; for the squire no sooner heard of her having abused his sister, than he swore twenty oaths he would send her to Bridewell.
Mrs Western was a very good-natured woman, and ordinarily of a forgiving temper. She had lately remitted the trespass of a stage-coachman, who had overturned her post-chaise into a ditch; nay, she had even broken the law, in refusing to prosecute a highwayman who had robbed her, not only of a sum of money, but of her ear-rings; at the same time d一ning her, and saying, "Such handsome b一s as you don't want jewels to set them off, and be d一n'd to you." But now, so uncertain are our tempers, and so much do we at different times differ from ourselves, she would hear of no mitigation; nor could all the affected penitence of Honour, nor all the entreaties of Sophia for her own servant, prevail with her to desist from earnestly desiring her brother to execute justiceship (for it was indeed a syllable more than justice) on the wench.
But luckily the clerk had a qualification, which no clerk to a justice of peace ought ever to be without, namely, some understanding in the law of this realm. He therefore whispered in the ear of the justice that he would exceed his authority by committing the girl to Bridewell, as there had been no attempt to break the peace; "for I am afraid, sir," says he, "you cannot legally commit any one to Bridewell only for ill-breeding."
In matters of high importance, particularly in cases relating to the game, the justice was not always attentive to these admonitions of his
313
clerk; for, indeed, in executing the laws under that head, many justices of peace suppose they have a large discretionary power, by virtue of which, under the notion of searching for and taking away engines for the destruction of the game, they often commit trespasses, and sometimes felony, at their pleasure.
But this offence was not of quite so high a nature, nor so dangerous to the society. Here, therefore, the justice behaved with some attention to the advice of his clerk; for, in fact, he had already had two informations exhibited against him in the King's Bench, and had no curiosity to try a third.
The squire, therefore, putting on a most wise and significant countenance, after a preface of several hums and hahs, told his sister, that upon more mature deliberation, he was of opinion, that "as there was no breaking up of the peace, such as the law," says he, "calls breaking open a door, or breaking a hedge, or breaking a head, or any such sort of breaking, the matter did not amount to a felonious kind of a thing, nor trespasses, nor damages, and, therefore, there was no punishment in the law for it."
Mrs Western said, "she knew the law much better; that she had known servants very severely punished for affronting their masters;" and then named a certain justice of the peace in London, "who," she said, "would commit a servant to Bridewell at any time when a master or mistress desired it."
"Like enough," cries the squire; "it may be so in London; but the law is different in the country." Here followed a very learned dispute between the brother and sister concerning the law, which we would insert, if we imagined many of our readers could understand it. This was, however, at length referred by both parties to the clerk, who decided it in favour of the magistrate; and Mrs Western was, in the end, obliged to content herself with the satisfaction of having Honour turned away; to which Sophia herself very readily and cheerfully consented.
Thus Fortune, after having diverted herself, according to custom, with two or three frolicks, at last disposed all matters to the advantage of our heroine; who indeed succeeded admirably well in her deceit, considering it was the first she had ever practised. And, to say the truth, I have often concluded, that the honest part of mankind would be much too hard for the knavish, if they could bring themselves to incur the guilt, or thought it worth their while to take the trouble.
314
Honour acted her part to the utmost perfection. She no sooner saw herself secure from all danger of Bridewell, a word which had raised most horrible ideas in her mind, than she resumed those airs which her terrors before had a little abated; and laid down her place, with as much affectation of content, and indeed of contempt, as was ever practised at the resignation of places of much greater importance. If the reader pleases, therefore, we chuse rather to say she resigned一which hath, indeed, been always held a synonymous expression with being turned out, or turned away.
Mr Western ordered her to be very expeditious in packing; for his sister declared she would not sleep another night under the same roof with so impudent a slut. To work therefore she went, and that so earnestly, that everything was ready early in the evening; when, having received her wages, away packed bag and baggage, to the great satisfaction of every one, but of none more than of Sophia; who, having appointed her maid to meet her at a certain place not far from the house, exactly at the dreadful and ghostly hour of twelve, began to prepare for her own departure.
But first she was obliged to give two painful audiences, the one to her aunt, and the other to her father. In these Mrs Western herself began to talk to her in a more peremptory stile than before: but her father treated her in so violent and outrageous a manner, that he frightened her into an affected compliance with his will; which so highly pleased the good squire, that he changed his frowns into smiles, and his menaces into promises: he vowed his whole soul was wrapt in hers; that her consent (for so he construed the words, "You know, sir, I must not, nor can, refuse to obey any absolute command of yours") had made him the happiest of mankind. He then gave her a large bank-bill to dispose of in any trinkets she pleased, and kissed and embraced her in the fondest manner, while tears of joy trickled from those eyes which a few moments before had darted fire and rage against the dear object of all his affection.
Instances of this behaviour in parents are so common, that the reader, I doubt not, will be very little astonished at the whole conduct of Mr Western. If he should, I own I am not able to account for it; since that he loved his daughter most tenderly, is, I think, beyond dispute. So indeed have many others, who have rendered their children most completely miserable by the same conduct; which, though it is almost universal in parents, hath always appeared to me to be the most unaccountable of all the absurdities which ever entered into the brain of that strange prodigious creature man.
315
The latter part of Mr Western's behaviour had so strong an effect on the tender heart of Sophia, that it suggested a thought to her, which not all the sophistry of her politic aunt, nor all the menaces of her father, had ever once brought into her head. She reverenced her father so piously, and loved him so passionately, that she had scarce ever felt more pleasing sensations, than what arose from the share she frequently had of contributing to his amusement, and sometimes, perhaps, to higher gratifications; for he never could contain the delight of hearing her commended, which he had the satisfaction of hearing almost every day of her life. The idea, therefore, of the immense happiness she should convey to her father by her consent to this match, made a strong impression on her mind. Again, the extreme piety of such an act of obedience worked very forcibly, as she had a very deep sense of religion. Lastly, when she reflected how much she herself was to suffer, being indeed to become little less than a sacrifice, or a martyr, to filial love and duty, she felt an agreeable tickling in a certain little passion, which though it bears no immediate affinity either to religion or virtue, is often so kind as to lend great assistance in executing the purposes of both.
Sophia was charmed with the contemplation of so heroic an action, and began to compliment herself with much premature flattery, when Cupid, who lay hid in her muff, suddenly crept out, and like Punchinello in a puppet-show, kicked all out before him. In truth (for we scorn to deceive our reader, or to vindicate the character of our heroine by ascribing her actions to supernatural impulse) the thoughts of her beloved Jones, and some hopes (however distant) in which he was very particularly concerned, immediately destroyed all which filial love, piety, and pride had, with their joint endeavours, been labouring to bring about.
But before we proceed any farther with Sophia, we must now look back to Mr Jones.
316

Chapter A Vx
Containing several matters, natural enough perhaps, but low.
The reader will be pleased to remember, that we left Mr Jones, in the beginning of this book, on his road to Bristol; being determined to seek his fortune at sea, or rather, indeed, to fly away from his fortune on shore.
It happened (a thing not very unusual), that the guide who undertook to conduct him on his way, was unluckily unacquainted with the road; so that having missed his right track, and being ashamed to ask information, he rambled about backwards and forwards till night came on, and it began to grow dark. Jones suspecting what had happened, acquainted the guide with his apprehensions; but he insisted on it, that they were in the right road, and added, it would be very strange if he should not know the road to Bristol; though, in reality, it would have been much stranger if he had known it, having never past through it in his life before.
Jones had not such implicit faith in his guide, but that on their arrival at a village he inquired of the first fellow he saw, whether they were in the road to Bristol. "Whence did you come?" cries the fellow. "No matter," says Jones, a little hastily; "I want to know if this be the road to Bris-tol?"一"The road to Bristol!" cries the fellow, scratching his head: "why, measter, I believe you will hardly get to Bristol this way to-night."一"Prithee, friend, then," answered Jones, "do tell us which is the way."一"Why, measter," cries the fellow, "you must be come out of your road the Lord knows whither; for thick way goeth to Glocester."一"Well, and which way goes to Bristol?" said Jones. "Why, you be going away from Bristol," answered the fellow. "Then," said Jones, "we must go back again?"一"Ay, you must," said the fellow. "Well, and when we come back to the top of the hill, which way must we take?"一"Why, you must keep the strait road."一"But I remember there are two roads, one to the right and the other to the left."一"Why, you must keep the right-hand road, and then gu strait vorwards; only remember to turn vurst to your right,
317
and then to your left again, and then to your right, and that brings you to the squire's; and then you must keep strait vorwards, and turn to the left."
Another fellow now came up, and asked which way the gentlemen were going; of which being informed by Jones, he first scratched his head, and then leaning upon a pole he had in his hand, began to tell him, "That he must keep the right-hand road for about a mile, or a mile and a half, or such a matter, and then he must turn short to the left, which would bring him round by Measter Jin Bearnes's."一"But which is Mr John Bearnes's?" says Jones. "O Lord!" cries the fellow, "why, don't you know Measter Jin Bearnes? Whence then did you come?"
These two fellows had almost conquered the patience of Jones, when a plain well-looking man (who was indeed a Quaker) accosted him thus: "Friend, I perceive thou hast lost thy way; and if thou wilt take my advice, thou wilt not attempt to find it to-night. It is almost dark, and the road is difficult to hit; besides, there have been several robberies committed lately between this and Bristol. Here is a very creditable good house just by, where thou may'st find good entertainment for thyself and thy cattle till morning." Jones, after a little persuasion, agreed to stay in this place till the morning, and was conducted by his friend to the publichouse.
The landlord, who was a very civil fellow, told Jones, "He hoped he would excuse the badness of his accommodation; for that his wife was gone from home, and had locked up almost everything, and carried the keys along with her." Indeed the fact was, that a favourite daughter of hers was just married, and gone that morning home with her husband; and that she and her mother together had almost stript the poor man of all his goods, as well as money; for though he had several children, this daughter only, who was the mother's favourite, was the object of her consideration; and to the humour of this one child she would with pleasure have sacrificed all the rest, and her husband into the bargain.
Though Jones was very unfit for any kind of company, and would have preferred being alone, yet he could not resist the importunities of the honest Quaker; who was the more desirous of sitting with him, from having remarked the melancholy which appeared both in his countenance and behaviour; and which the poor Quaker thought his conversation might in some measure relieve.
After they had past some time together, in such a manner that my honest friend might have thought himself at one of his silent meetings, the
318
Quaker began to be moved by some spirit or other, probably that of curiosity, and said, "Friend, I perceive some sad disaster hath befallen thee; but pray be of comfort. Perhaps thou hast lost a friend. If so, thou must consider we are all mortal. And why shouldst thou grieve, when thou knowest thy grief will do thy friend no good? We are all born to affliction. I myself have my sorrows as well as thee, and most probably greater sorrows. Though I have a clear estate of £100 a year, which is as much as I want, and I have a conscience, I thank the Lord, void of offence; my constitution is sound and strong, and there is no man can demand a debt of me, nor accuse me of an injury; yet, friend, I should be concerned to think thee as miserable as myself."
Here the Quaker ended with a deep sigh; and Jones presently answered, "I am very sorry, sir, for your unhappiness, whatever is the occasion of it."一"Ah! friend," replied the Quaker, "one only daughter is the occasion; one who was my greatest delight upon earth, and who within this week is run away from me, and is married against my consent. I had provided her a proper match, a sober man and one of substance; but she, forsooth, would chuse for herself, and away she is gone with a young fellow not worth a groat. If she had been dead, as I suppose thy friend is, I should have been happy."一"That is very strange, sir," said Jones. "Why, would it not be better for her to be dead, than to be a beggar?" replied the Quaker: "for, as I told you, the fellow is not worth a groat; and surely she cannot expect that I shall ever give her a shilling. No, as she hath married for love, let her live on love if she can; let her carry her love to market, and see whether any one will change it into silver, or even into halfpence."一"You know your own concerns best, sir," said Jones. "It must have been," continued the Quaker, "a long premeditated scheme to cheat me: for they have known one another from their infancy; and I always preached to her against love, and told her a thousand times over it was all folly and wickedness. Nay, the cunning slut pretended to hearken to me, and to despise all wantonness of the flesh; and yet at last broke out at a window two pair of stairs: for I began, indeed, a little to suspect her, and had locked her up carefully, intending the very next morning to have married her up to my liking. But she disappointed me within a few hours, and escaped away to the lover of her own chusing; who lost no time, for they were married and bedded and all within an hour. But it shall be the worst hour's work for them both that ever they did; for they may starve, or beg, or steal together, for me. I will never give either of them a farthing." Here Jones starting up cried, "I really must be excused: I wish you would leave me."一"Come, come,
319
friend," said the Quaker, "don't give way to concern. You see there are other people miserable besides yourself."一"I see there are madmen, and fools, and villains in the world," cries Jones. "But let me give you a piece of advice: send for your daughter and son-in-law home, and don't be yourself the only cause of misery to one you pretend to love."一"Send for her and her husband home!" cries the Quaker loudly; "I would sooner send for the two greatest enemies I have in the world!"一"Well, go home yourself, or where you please," said Jones, "for I will sit no longer in such company."一"Nay, friend," answered the Quaker, "I scorn to impose my company on any one." He then offered to pull money from his pocket, but Jones pushed him with some violence out of the room.
The subject of the Quaker's discourse had so deeply affected Jones, that he stared very wildly all the time he was speaking. This the Quaker had observed, and this, added to the rest of his behaviour, inspired honest Broadbrim with a conceit, that his companion was in reality out of his senses. Instead of resenting the affront, therefore, the Quaker was moved with compassion for his unhappy circumstances; and having communicated his opinion to the landlord, he desired him to take great care of his guest, and to treat him with the highest civility.
"Indeed," says the landlord, "I shall use no such civility towards him; for it seems, for all his laced waistcoat there, he is no more a gentleman than myself, but a poor parish bastard, bred up at a great squire's about thirty miles off, and now turned out of doors (not for any good to be sure). I shall get him out of my house as soon as possible. If I do lose my reckoning, the first loss is always the best. It is not above a year ago that I lost a silver spoon."
"What dost thou talk of a parish bastard, Robin?" answered the Quaker. "Thou must certainly be mistaken in thy man."
"Not at all," replied Robin; "the guide, who knows him very well, told it me." For, indeed, the guide had no sooner taken his place at the kitchen fire, than he acquainted the whole company with all he knew or had ever heard concerning Jones.
The Quaker was no sooner assured by this fellow of the birth and low fortune of Jones, than all compassion for him vanished; and the honest plain man went home fired with no less indignation than a duke would have felt at receiving an affront from such a person.
The landlord himself conceived an equal disdain for his guest; so that when Jones rung the bell in order to retire to bed, he was acquainted that he could have no bed there. Besides disdain of the mean condition of his
320
guest, Robin entertained violent suspicion of his intentions, which were, he supposed, to watch some favourable opportunity of robbing the house. In reality, he might have been very well eased of these apprehensions, by the prudent precautions of his wife and daughter, who had already removed everything which was not fixed to the freehold; but he was by nature suspicious, and had been more particularly so since the loss of his spoon. In short, the dread of being robbed totally absorbed the comfortable consideration that he had nothing to lose.
Jones being assured that he could have no bed, very contentedly betook himself to a great chair made with rushes, when sleep, which had lately shunned his company in much better apartments, generously paid him a visit in his humble cell.
As for the landlord, he was prevented by his fears from retiring to rest. He returned therefore to the kitchen fire, whence he could survey the only door which opened into the parlour, or rather hole, where Jones was seated; and as for the window to that room, it was impossible for any creature larger than a cat to have made his escape through it.
321
The adventure of a company of soldiers.
The landlord having taken his seat directly opposite to the door of the parlour, determined to keep guard there the whole night. The guide and another fellow remained long on duty with him, though they neither knew his suspicions, nor had any of their own. The true cause of their watching did, indeed, at length, put an end to it; for this was no other than the strength and goodness of the beer, of which having tippled a very large quantity, they grew at first very noisy and vociferous, and afterwards fell both asleep.
But it was not in the power of liquor to compose the fears of Robin. He continued still waking in his chair, with his eyes fixed stedfastly on the door which led into the apartment of Mr Jones, till a violent thundering at his outward gate called him from his seat, and obliged him to open it; which he had no sooner done, than his kitchen was immediately full of gentlemen in red coats, who all rushed upon him in as tumultuous a manner as if they intended to take his little castle by storm.
The landlord was now forced from his post to furnish his numerous guests with beer, which they called for with great eagerness; and upon his second or third return from the cellar, he saw Mr Jones standing before the fire in the midst of the soldiers; for it may easily be believed, that the arrival of so much good company should put an end to any sleep, unless that from which we are to be awakened only by the last trumpet.
The company having now pretty well satisfied their thirst, nothing remained but to pay the reckoning, a circumstance often productive of much mischief and discontent among the inferior rank of gentry, who are apt to find great difficulty in assessing the sum, with exact regard to distributive justice, which directs that every man shall pay according to the quantity which he drinks. This difficulty occurred upon the present occasion; and it was the greater, as some gentlemen had, in their extreme
322
hurry, marched off, after their first draught, and had entirely forgot to contribute anything towards the said reckoning.
A violent dispute now arose, in which every word may be said to have been deposed upon oath; for the oaths were at least equal to all the other words spoken. In this controversy the whole company spoke together, and every man seemed wholly bent to extenuate the sum which fell to his share; so that the most probable conclusion which could be foreseen was, that a large portion of the reckoning would fall to the landlord's share to pay, or (what is much the same thing) would remain unpaid.
All this while Mr Jones was engaged in conversation with the serjeant; for that officer was entirely unconcerned in the present dispute, being privileged by immemorial custom from all contribution.
The dispute now grew so very warm that it seemed to draw towards a military decision, when Jones, stepping forward, silenced all their clamours at once, by declaring that he would pay the whole reckoning, which indeed amounted to no more than three shillings and fourpence.
This declaration procured Jones the thanks and applause of the whole company. The terms honourable, noble, and worthy gentleman, resounded through the room; nay, my landlord himself began to have a better opinion of him, and almost to disbelieve the account which the guide had given.
The serjeant had informed Mr Jones that they were marching against the rebels, and expected to be commanded by the glorious Duke of Cumberland. By which the reader may perceive (a circumstance which we have not thought necessary to communicate before) that this was the very time when the late rebellion was at the highest; and indeed the banditti were now marched into England, intending, as it was thought, to fight the king's forces, and to attempt pushing forward to the metropolis.
Jones had some heroic ingredients in his composition, and was a hearty well-wisher to the glorious cause of liberty, and of the Protestant religion. It is no wonder, therefore, that in circumstances which would have warranted a much more romantic and wild undertaking, it should occur to him to serve as a volunteer in this expedition.
Our commanding officer had said all in his power to encourage and promote this good disposition, from the first moment he had been acquainted with it. He now proclaimed the noble resolution aloud, which was received with great pleasure by the whole company, who all cried out, "God bless King George and your honour;" and then added, with many oaths, "We will stand by you both to the last drops of our blood."
323
The gentleman who had been all night tippling at the alehouse, was prevailed on by some arguments which a corporal had put into his hands, to undertake the same expedition. And now the portmanteau belonging to Mr Jones being put up in the baggage-cart, the forces were about to move forwards; when the guide, stepping up to Jones, said, "Sir, I hope you will consider that the horses have been kept out all night, and we have travelled a great ways out of our way." Jones was surprized at the impudence of this demand, and acquainted the soldiers with the merits of his cause, who were all unanimous in condemning the guide for his endeavours to put upon a gentleman. Some said, he ought to be tied neck and heels; others that he deserved to run the gantlope; and the serjeant shook his cane at him, and wished he had him under his command, swearing heartily he would make an example of him.
Jones contented himself however with a negative punishment, and walked off with his new comrades, leaving the guide to the poor revenge of cursing and reviling him; in which latter the landlord joined, saying, "Ay, ay, he is a pure one, I warrant you. A pretty gentleman, indeed, to go for a soldier! He shall wear a laced wastecoat truly. It is an old proverb and a true one, all is not gold that glisters. I am glad my house is well rid of him."
All that day the serjeant and the young soldier marched together; and the former, who was an arch fellow, told the latter many entertaining stories of his campaigns, though in reality he had never made any; for he was but lately come into the service, and had, by his own dexterity, so well ingratiated himself with his officers, that he had promoted himself to a halberd; chiefly indeed by his merit in recruiting, in which he was most excellently well skilled.
Much mirth and festivity passed among the soldiers during their march. In which the many occurrences that had passed at their last quarters were remembered, and every one, with great freedom, made what jokes he pleased on his officers, some of which were of the coarser kind, and very near bordering on scandal. This brought to our heroe's mind the custom which he had read of among the Greeks and Romans, of indulging, on certain festivals and solemn occasions, the liberty to slaves, of using an uncontrouled freedom of speech towards their masters.
Our little army, which consisted of two companies of foot, were now arrived at the place where they were to halt that evening. The serjeant then acquainted his lieutenant, who was the commanding officer, that they had picked up two fellows in that day's march, one of which, he
324
said, was as fine a man as ever he saw (meaning the tippler), for that he was near six feet, well proportioned, and strongly limbed; and the other (meaning Jones) would do well enough for the rear rank.
The new soldiers were now produced before the officer, who having examined the six-feet man, he being first produced, came next to survey Jones: at the first sight of whom, the lieutenant could not help showing some surprize; for besides that he was very well dressed, and was naturally genteel, he had a remarkable air of dignity in his look, which is rarely seen among the vulgar, and is indeed not inseparably annexed to the features of their superiors.
"Sir," said the lieutenant, "my serjeant informed me that you are desirous of enlisting in the company I have at present under my command; if so, sir, we shall very gladly receive a gentleman who promises to do much honour to the company by bearing arms in it."
Jones answered: "That he had not mentioned anything of enlisting himself; that he was most zealously attached to the glorious cause for which they were going to fight, and was very desirous of serving as a volunteer;" concluding with some compliments to the lieutenant, and expressing the great satisfaction he should have in being under his command.
The lieutenant returned his civility, commended his resolution, shook him by the hand, and invited him to dine with himself and the rest of the officers.
325

Chapter 且
The adventure of a company of officers.
The lieutenant, whom we mentioned in the preceding chapter, and who commanded this party, was now near sixty years of age. He had entered very young into the army, and had served in the capacity of an ensign at the battle of Tannieres; here he had received two wounds, and had so well distinguished himself, that he was by the Duke of Marlborough advanced to be a lieutenant, immediately after that battle.
In this commission he had continued ever since, viz., near forty years; during which time he had seen vast numbers preferred over his head, and had now the mortification to be commanded by boys, whose fathers were at nurse when he first entered into the service.
Nor was this ill success in his profession solely owing to his having no friends among the men in power. He had the misfortune to incur the displeasure of his colonel, who for many years continued in the command of this regiment. Nor did he owe the implacable ill-will which this man bore him to any neglect or deficiency as an officer, nor indeed to any fault in himself; but solely to the indiscretion of his wife, who was a very beautiful woman, and who, though she was remarkably fond of her husband, would not purchase his preferment at the expense of certain favours which the colonel required of her.
The poor lieutenant was more peculiarly unhappy in this, that while he felt the effects of the enmity of his colonel, he neither knew, nor suspected, that he really bore him any; for he could not suspect an ill-will for which he was not conscious of giving any cause; and his wife, fearing what her husband's nice regard to his honour might have occasioned, contented herself with preserving her virtue without enjoying the triumphs of her conquest.
This unfortunate officer (for so I think he may be called) had many good qualities besides his merit in his profession; for he was a religious, honest, good-natured man; and had behaved so well in his command,
326
that he was highly esteemed and beloved not only by the soldiers of his own company, but by the whole regiment.
The other officers who marched with him were a French lieutenant, who had been long enough out of France to forget his own language, but not long enough in England to learn ours, so that he really spoke no language at all, and could barely make himself understood on the most ordinary occasions. There were likewise two ensigns, both very young fellows; one of whom had been bred under an attorney, and the other was son to the wife of a nobleman's butler.
As soon as dinner was ended, Jones informed the company of the merriment which had passed among the soldiers upon their march; "and yet," says he, "notwithstanding all their vociferation, I dare swear they will behave more like Grecians than Trojans when they come to the en-emy."—"Grecians and Trojans!" says one of the ensigns, "who the devil are they? I have heard of all the troops in Europe, but never of any such as these."
"Don't pretend to more ignorance than you have, Mr Northerton," said the worthy lieutenant. "I suppose you have heard of the Greeks and Trojans, though perhaps you never read Pope's Homer; who, I remember, now the gentleman mentions it, compares the march of the Trojans to the cackling of geese, and greatly commends the silence of the Grecians. And upon my honour there is great justice in the cadet's observation."
"Begar, me remember dem ver well," said the French lieutenant: "me ave read them at school in dans Madam Daciere, des Greek, des Trojan, dey fight for von woman—ouy, ouy, me ave read all dat."
"D—n Homo with all my heart," says Northerton; "I have the marks of him on my a一 yet. There's Thomas, of our regiment, always carries a Homo in his pocket; d一n me, if ever I come at it, if I don't burn it. And there's Corderius, another d一n'd son of a whore, that hath got me many a hogging."
"Then you have been at school, Mr Northerton?" said the lieutenant.
"Ay, d一n me, have I," answered he; "the devil take my father for sending me thither! The old put wanted to make a parson of me, but d一n me, thinks I to myself, I'll nick you there, old cull; the devil a smack of your nonsense shall you ever get into me. There's Jemmy Oliver, of our regiment, he narrowly escaped being a pimp too, and that would have been a thousand pities; for d—n me if he is not one of the prettiest fellows in the whole world; but he went farther than I with the old cull, for Jimmey can neither write nor read."
327
"You give your friend a very good character," said the lieutenant, "and a very deserved one, I dare say. But prithee, Northerton, leave off that foolish as well as wicked custom of swearing; for you are deceived, I promise you, if you think there is wit or politeness in it. I wish, too, you would take my advice, and desist from abusing the clergy. Scandalous names, and reflections cast on any body of men, must be always unjustifiable; but especially so, when thrown on so sacred a function; for to abuse the body is to abuse the function itself; and I leave to you to judge how inconsistent such behaviour is in men who are going to fight in defence of the Protestant religion."
Mr Adderly, which was the name of the other ensign, had sat hitherto kicking his heels and humming a tune, without seeming to listen to the discourse; he now answered, "O, Monsieur, on ne parle pas de la religion dans la guerre.''一"Well said, Jack," cries Northerton: "if la religion was the only matter, the parsons should fight their own battles for me."
"I don't know, gentlemen," said Jones, "what may be your opinion; but I think no man can engage in a nobler cause than that of his religion; and I have observed, in the little I have read of history, that no soldiers have fought so bravely as those who have been inspired with a religious zeal: for my own part, though I love my king and country, I hope, as well as any man in it, yet the Protestant interest is no small motive to my becoming a volunteer in the cause."
Northerton now winked on Adderly, and whispered to him slily, "Smoke the prig, Adderly, smoke him." Then turning to Jones, said to him, "I am very glad, sir, you have chosen our regiment to be a volunteer in; for if our parson should at any time take a cup too much, I find you can supply his place. I presume, sir, you have been at the university; may I crave the favour to know what college?"
"Sir," answered Jones, "so far from having been at the university, I have even had the advantage of yourself, for I was never at school."
"I presumed," cries the ensign, "only upon the information of your great learning."一"Oh! sir," answered Jones, "it is as possible for a man to know something without having been at school, as it is to have been at school and to know nothing."
"Well said, young volunteer," cries the lieutenant. "Upon my word, Northerton, you had better let him alone; for he will be too hard for you."
Northerton did not very well relish the sarcasm of Jones; but he thought the provocation was scarce sufficient to justify a blow, or a rascal, or scoundrel, which were the only repartees that suggested
328
themselves. He was, therefore, silent at present; but resolved to take the first opportunity of returning the jest by abuse.
It now came to the turn of Mr Jones to give a toast, as it is called; who could not refrain from mentioning his dear Sophia. This he did the more readily, as he imagined it utterly impossible that any one present should guess the person he meant.
But the lieutenant, who was the toast-master, was not contented with Sophia only. He said, he must have her sir-name; upon which Jones hesitated a little, and presently after named Miss Sophia Western. Ensign Northerton declared he would not drink her health in the same round with his own toast, unless somebody would vouch for her. "I knew one Sophy Western," says he, "that was lain with by half the young fellows at Bath; and perhaps this is the same woman." Jones very solemnly assured him of the contrary; asserting that the young lady he named was one of great fashion and fortune. "Ay, ay," says the ensign, "and so she is: d一n me, it is the same woman; and I'll hold half a dozen of Burgundy, Tom French of our regiment brings her into company with us at any tavern in Bridges-street." He then proceeded to describe her person exactly (for he had seen her with her aunt), and concluded with saying, "that her father had a great estate in Somersetshire."
The tenderness of lovers can ill brook the least jesting with the names of their mistresses. However, Jones, though he had enough of the lover and of the heroe too in his disposition, did not resent these slanders as hastily as, perhaps, he ought to have done. To say the truth, having seen but little of this kind of wit, he did not readily understand it, and for a long time imagined Mr Northerton had really mistaken his charmer for some other. But now, turning to the ensign with a stern aspect, he said, "Pray, sir, chuse some other subject for your wit; for I promise you I will bear no jesting with this lady's character." "Jesting!" cries the other, "d一n me if ever I was more in earnest in my life. Tom French of our regiment had both her and her aunt at Bath." "Then I must tell you in earnest," cries Jones, "that you are one of the most impudent rascals upon earth."
He had no sooner spoken these words, than the ensign, together with a volley of curses, discharged a bottle full at the head of Jones, which hitting him a little above the right temple, brought him instantly to the ground.
The conqueror perceiving the enemy to lie motionless before him, and blood beginning to flow pretty plentifully from his wound, began now to think of quitting the field of battle, where no more honour was to be
329
gotten; but the lieutenant interposed, by stepping before the door, and thus cut off his retreat.
Northerton was very importunate with the lieutenant for his liberty; urging the ill consequences of his stay, asking him, what he could have done less? "Zounds!" says he, "I was but in jest with the fellow. I never heard any harm of Miss Western in my life." "Have not you?" said the lieutenant; "then you richly deserve to be hanged, as well for making such jests, as for using such a weapon: you are my prisoner, sir; nor shall you stir from hence till a proper guard comes to secure you."
Such an ascendant had our lieutenant over this ensign, that all that fervency of courage which had levelled our poor heroe with the floor, would scarce have animated the said ensign to have drawn his sword against the lieutenant, had he then had one dangling at his side: but all the swords being hung up in the room, were, at the very beginning of the fray, secured by the French officer. So that Mr Northerton was obliged to attend the final issue of this affair.
The French gentleman and Mr Adderly, at the desire of their commanding officer, had raised up the body of Jones, but as they could perceive but little (if any) sign of life in him, they again let him fall, Adderly damning him for having blooded his wastecoat; and the Frenchman declaring, "Begar, me no tush the Engliseman de mort: me have heard de Englise ley, law, what you call, hang up de man dat tush him last."
When the good lieutenant applied himself to the door, he applied himself likewise to the bell; and the drawer immediately attending, he dispatched him for a file of musqueteers and a surgeon. These commands, together with the drawer's report of what he had himself seen, not only produced the soldiers, but presently drew up the landlord of the house, his wife, and servants, and, indeed, every one else who happened at that time to be in the inn.
To describe every particular, and to relate the whole conversation of the ensuing scene, is not within my power, unless I had forty pens, and could, at once, write with them all together, as the company now spoke. The reader must, therefore, content himself with the most remarkable incidents, and perhaps he may very well excuse the rest.
The first thing done was securing the body of Northerton, who being delivered into the custody of six men with a corporal at their head, was by them conducted from a place which he was very willing to leave, but it was unluckily to a place whither he was very unwilling to go. To say the truth, so whimsical are the desires of ambition, the very moment this
330
youth had attained the above-mentioned honour, he would have been well contented to have retired to some corner of the world, where the fame of it should never have reached his ears.
It surprizes us, and so perhaps, it may the reader, that the lieutenant, a worthy and good man, should have applied his chief care, rather to secure the offender, than to preserve the life of the wounded person. We mention this observation, not with any view of pretending to account for so odd a behaviour, but lest some critic should hereafter plume himself on discovering it. We would have these gentlemen know we can see what is odd in characters as well as themselves, but it is our business to relate facts as they are; which, when we have done, it is the part of the learned and sagacious reader to consult that original book of nature, whence every passage in our work is transcribed, though we quote not always the particular page for its authority.
The company which now arrived were of a different disposition. They suspended their curiosity concerning the person of the ensign, till they should see him hereafter in a more engaging attitude. At present, their whole concern and attention were employed about the bloody object on the floor; which being placed upright in a chair, soon began to discover some symptoms of life and motion. These were no sooner perceived by the company (for Jones was at first generally concluded to be dead) than they all fell at once to prescribing for him (for as none of the physical order was present, every one there took that office upon him).
Bleeding was the unanimous voice of the whole room; but unluckily there was no operator at hand; every one then cried, "Call the barber;" but none stirred a step. Several cordials was likewise prescribed in the same ineffective manner; till the landlord ordered up a tankard of strong beer, with a toast, which he said was the best cordial in England.
The person principally assistant on this occasion, indeed the only one who did any service, or seemed likely to do any, was the landlady: she cut off some of her hair, and applied it to the wound to stop the blood; she fell to chafing the youth's temples with her hand; and having exprest great contempt for her husband's prescription of beer, she despatched one of her maids to her own closet for a bottle of brandy, of which, as soon as it was brought, she prevailed on Jones, who was just returned to his senses, to drink a very large and plentiful draught.
Soon afterwards arrived the surgeon, who having viewed the wound, having shaken his head, and blamed everything which was done, ordered his patient instantly to bed; in which place we think proper to
331
leave him some time to his repose, and shall here, therefore, put an end to this chapter.
332
13
Chapter 且 U
Containing the great address of the landlady, the great learning of a surgeon, and the solid skill in casuistry of the worthy lieutenant.
When the wounded man was carried to his bed, and the house began again to clear up from the hurry which this accident had occasioned, the landlady thus addressed the commanding officer: "I am afraid, sir," said she, "this young man did not behave himself as well as he should do to your honours; and if he had been killed, I suppose he had but his desarts: to be sure, when gentlemen admit inferior parsons into their company, they oft to keep their distance; but, as my first husband used to say, few of 'em know how to do it. For my own part, I am sure I should not have suffered any fellows to include themselves into gentlemen's company; but I thoft he had been an officer himself, till the serjeant told me he was but a recruit."
"Landlady," answered the lieutenant, "you mistake the whole matter. The young man behaved himself extremely well, and is, I believe, a much better gentleman than the ensign who abused him. If the young fellow dies, the man who struck him will have most reason to be sorry for it: for the regiment will get rid of a very troublesome fellow, who is a scandal to the army; and if he escapes from the hands of justice, blame me, madam, that's all."
"Ay! ay! good lack-a-day!" said the landlady; "who could have thoft it? Ay, ay, ay, I am satisfied your honour will see justice done; and to be sure it oft to be to every one. Gentlemen oft not to kill poor folks without answering for it. A poor man hath a soul to be saved, as well as his betters."
"Indeed, madam," said the lieutenant, "you do the volunteer wrong: I dare swear he is more of a gentleman than the officer."
"Ay!" cries the landlady; "why, look you there, now: well, my first husband was a wise man; he used to say, you can't always know the inside by the outside. Nay, that might have been well enough too; for I never
333
saw'd him till he was all over blood. Who would have thoft it? mayhap, some young gentleman crossed in love. Good lack-a-day, if he should die, what a concern it will be to his parents! why, sure the devil must possess the wicked wretch to do such an act. To be sure, he is a scandal to the army, as your honour says; for most of the gentlemen of the army that ever I saw, are quite different sort of people, and look as if they would scorn to spill any Christian blood as much as any men: I mean, that is, in a civil way, as my first husband used to say. To be sure, when they come into the wars, there must be bloodshed: but that they are not to be blamed for. The more of our enemies they kill there, the better: and I wish, with all my heart, they could kill every mother's son of them."
"O fie, madam!" said the lieutenant, smiling; ''all is rather too bloody-minded a wish."
"Not at all, sir," answered she; "I am not at all bloody-minded, only to our enemies; and there is no harm in that. To be sure it is natural for us to wish our enemies dead, that the wars may be at an end, and our taxes be lowered; for it is a dreadful thing to pay as we do. Why now, there is above forty shillings for window-lights, and yet we have stopt up all we could; we have almost blinded the house, I am sure. Says I to the exciseman, says I, I think you oft to favour us; I am sure we are very good friends to the government: and so we are for sartain, for we pay a mint of money to 'um. And yet I often think to myself the government doth not imagine itself more obliged to us, than to those that don't pay 'um a farthing. Ay, ay, it is the way of the world."
She was proceeding in this manner when the surgeon entered the room. The lieutenant immediately asked how his patient did. But he resolved him only by saying, "Better, I believe, than he would have been by this time, if I had not been called; and even as it is, perhaps it would have been lucky if I could have been called sooner."一"I hope, sir," said the lieutenant, "the skull is not fractured."一"Hum," cries the surgeon: "fractures are not always the most dangerous symptoms. Contusions and lacerations are often attended with worse phaenomena, and with more fatal consequences, than fractures. People who know nothing of the matter conclude, if the skull is not fractured, all is well; whereas, I had rather see a man's skull broke all to pieces, than some contusions I have met with."一"I hope," says the lieutenant, "there are no such symptoms here."一"Symptoms," answered the surgeon, "are not always regular nor constant. I have known very unfavourable symptoms in the morning change to favourable ones at noon, and return to unfavourable again at night. Of wounds, indeed, it is rightly and truly said, Nemo repente fuit
334
turpissimus. I was once, I remember, called to a patient who had received a violent contusion in his tibia, by which the exterior cutis was lacerated, so that there was a profuse sanguinary discharge; and the interior membranes were so divellicated, that the os or bone very plainly appeared through the aperture of the vulnus or wound. Some febrile symptoms intervening at the same time (for the pulse was exuberant and indicated much phlebotomy), I apprehended an immediate mortification. To prevent which, I presently made a large orifice in the vein of the left arm, whence I drew twenty ounces of blood; which I expected to have found extremely sizy and glutinous, or indeed coagulated, as it is in pleuretic complaints; but, to my surprize, it appeared rosy and florid, and its consistency differed little from the blood of those in perfect health. I then applied a fomentation to the part, which highly answered the intention; and after three or four times dressing, the wound began to discharge a thick pus or matter, by which means the cohesion一But perhaps I do not make myself perfectly well understood?"一"No, really," answered the lieutenant, "I cannot say I understand a syllable."一"Well, sir," said the surgeon, "then I shall not tire your patience; in short, within six weeks my patient was able to walk upon his legs as perfectly as he could have done before he received the contusion."一"I wish, sir," said the lieutenant, "you would be so kind only to inform me, whether the wound this young gentleman hath had the misfortune to receive, is likely to prove mortal."一"Sir," answered the surgeon, "to say whether a wound will prove mortal or not at first dressing, would be very weak and foolish presumption: we are all mortal, and symptoms often occur in a cure which the greatest of our profession could never foresee."一"But do you think him in danger?" says the other.一"In danger! ay, surely," cries the doctor: "who is there among us, who, in the most perfect health, can be said not to be in danger? Can a man, therefore, with so bad a wound as this be said to be out of danger? All I can say at present is, that it is well I was called as I was, and perhaps it would have been better if I had been called sooner. I will see him again early in the morning; and in the meantime let him be kept extremely quiet, and drink liberally of watergruel."一"Won't you allow him sack-whey?" said the landlady.一"Ay, ay, sack-whey," cries the doctor, "if you will, provided it be very small."一"And a little chicken broth too?" added she.一"Yes, yes, chicken broth," said the doctor, "is very good."一"Mayn't I make him some jellies too?" said the landlady.一"Ay, ay," answered the doctor, "jellies are very good for wounds, for they promote cohesion." And indeed it was lucky
335
she had not named soup or high sauces, for the doctor would have complied, rather than have lost the custom of the house.
The doctor was no sooner gone, than the landlady began to trumpet forth his fame to the lieutenant, who had not, from their short acquaintance, conceived quite so favourable an opinion of his physical abilities as the good woman, and all the neighbourhood, entertained (and perhaps very rightly); for though I am afraid the doctor was a little of a coxcomb, he might be nevertheless very much of a surgeon.
The lieutenant having collected from the learned discourse of the surgeon that Mr Jones was in great danger, gave orders for keeping Mr Northerton under a very strict guard, designing in the morning to attend him to a justice of peace, and to commit the conducting the troops to Gloucester to the French lieutenant, who, though he could neither read, write, nor speak any language, was, however, a good officer.
In the evening, our commander sent a message to Mr Jones, that if a visit would not be troublesome, he would wait on him. This civility was very kindly and thankfully received by Jones, and the lieutenant accordingly went up to his room, where he found the wounded man much better than he expected; nay, Jones assured his friend, that if he had not received express orders to the contrary from the surgeon, he should have got up long ago; for he appeared to himself to be as well as ever, and felt no other inconvenience from his wound but an extreme soreness on that side of his head.
"I should be very glad," quoth the lieutenant, "if you was as well as you fancy yourself, for then you could be able to do yourself justice immediately; for when a matter can't be made up, as in case of a blow, the sooner you take him out the better; but I am afraid you think yourself better than you are, and he would have too much advantage over you."
"I'll try, however," answered Jones, "if you please, and will be so kind to lend me a sword, for I have none here of my own."
"My sword is heartily at your service, my dear boy," cries the lieutenant, kissing him; "you are a brave lad, and I love your spirit; but I fear your strength; for such a blow, and so much loss of blood, must have very much weakened you; and though you feel no want of strength in your bed, yet you most probably would after a thrust or two. I can't consent to your taking him out tonight; but I hope you will be able to come up with us before we get many days' march advance; and I give you my honour you shall have satisfaction, or the man who hath injured you shan't stay in our regiment."
336
"I wish," said Jones, "it was possible to decide this matter to-night: now you have mentioned it to me, I shall not be able to rest."
"Oh, never think of it," returned the other: "a few days will make no difference. The wounds of honour are not like those in your body: they suffer nothing by the delay of cure. It will be altogether as well for you to receive satisfaction a week hence as now."
"But suppose," says Jones, "I should grow worse, and die of the consequences of my present wound?"
"Then your honour," answered the lieutenant, "will require no reparation at all. I myself will do justice to your character, and testify to the world your intention to have acted properly, if you had recovered."
"Still," replied Jones, "I am concerned at the delay. I am almost afraid to mention it to you who are a soldier; but though I have been a very wild young fellow, still in my most serious moments, and at the bottom, I am really a Christian."
"So am I too, I assure you," said the officer; "and so zealous a one, that I was pleased with you at dinner for taking up the cause of your religion; and I am a little offended with you now, young gentleman, that you should express a fear of declaring your faith before any one."
"But how terrible must it be," cries Jones, "to any one who is really a Christian, to cherish malice in his breast, in opposition to the command of Him who hath expressly forbid it? How can I bear to do this on a sickbed? Or how shall I make up my account, with such an article as this in my bosom against me?"
"Why, I believe there is such a command," cries the lieutenant; "but a man of honour can't keep it. And you must be a man of honour, if you will be in the army. I remember I once put the case to our chaplain over a bowl of punch, and he confessed there was much difficulty in it; but he said, he hoped there might be a latitude granted to soldiers in this one instance; and to be sure it is our duty to hope so; for who would bear to live without his honour? No, no, my dear boy, be a good Christian as long as you live; but be a man of honour too, and never put up an affront; not all the books, nor all the parsons in the world, shall ever persuade me to that. I love my religion very well, but I love my honour more. There must be some mistake in the wording the text, or in the translation, or in the understanding it, or somewhere or other. But however that be, a man must run the risque, for he must preserve his honour. So compose yourself to-night, and I promise you you shall have
337
an opportunity of doing yourself justice." Here he gave Jones a hearty buss, shook him by the hand, and took his leave.
But though the lieutenant's reasoning was very satisfactory to himself, it was not entirely so to his friend. Jones therefore, having revolved this matter much in his thoughts, at last came to a resolution, which the reader will find in the next chapter.
338

Chapter 且 T
A most dreadful chapter indeed; and which few readers ought to venture upon in an evening, especially when alone.
Jones swallowed a large mess of chicken, or rather cock, broth, with a very good appetite, as indeed he would have done the cock it was made of, with a pound of bacon into the bargain; and now, finding in himself no deficiency of either health or spirit, he resolved to get up and seek his enemy.
But first he sent for the serjeant, who was his first acquaintance among these military gentlemen. Unluckily that worthy officer having, in a literal sense, taken his fill of liquor, had been some time retired to his bolster, where he was snoring so loud that it was not easy to convey a noise in at his ears capable of drowning that which issued from his nostrils.
However, as Jones persisted in his desire of seeing him, a vociferous drawer at length found means to disturb his slumbers, and to acquaint him with the message. Of which the serjeant was no sooner made sensible, than he arose from his bed, and having his clothes already on, immediately attended. Jones did not think fit to acquaint the serjeant with his design; though he might have done it with great safety, for the halberdier was himself a man of honour, and had killed his man. He would therefore have faithfully kept this secret, or indeed any other which no reward was published for discovering. But as Jones knew not those virtues in so short an acquaintance, his caution was perhaps prudent and commendable enough.
He began therefore by acquainting the serjeant, that as he was now entered into the army, he was ashamed of being without what was perhaps the most necessary implement of a soldier; namely, a sword; adding, that he should be infinitely obliged to him, if he could procure one. "For which," says he, "I will give you any reasonable price; nor do I insist upon its being silver-hilted; only a good blade, and such as may become a soldier's thigh."
339
The serjeant, who well knew what had happened, and had heard that Jones was in a very dangerous condition, immediately concluded, from such a message, at such a time of night, and from a man in such a situation, that he was light-headed. Now as he had his wit (to use that word in its common signification) always ready, he bethought himself of making his advantage of this humour in the sick man. "Sir," says he, "I believe I can fit you. I have a most excellent piece of stuff by me. It is not indeed silver-hilted, which, as you say, doth not become a soldier; but the handle is decent enough, and the blade one of the best in Europe. It is a blade that一a blade that一in short, I will fetch it you this instant, and you shall see it and handle it. I am glad to see your honour so well with all my heart."
Being instantly returned with the sword, he delivered it to Jones, who took it and drew it; and then told the serjeant it would do very well, and bid him name his price.
The serjeant now began to harangue in praise of his goods. He said (nay he swore very heartily), "that the blade was taken from a French officer, of very high rank, at the battle of Dettingen. I took it myself," says he, "from his side, after I had knocked him o' the head. The hilt was a golden one. That I sold to one of our fine gentlemen; for there are some of them, an't please your honour, who value the hilt of a sword more than the blade."
Here the other stopped him, and begged him to name a price. The serjeant, who thought Jones absolutely out of his senses, and very near his end, was afraid lest he should injure his family by asking too little. However, after a moment's hesitation, he contented himself with naming twenty guineas, and swore he would not sell it for less to his own brother.
"Twenty guineas!" says Jones, in the utmost surprize: "sure you think I am mad, or that I never saw a sword in my life. Twenty guineas, indeed! I did not imagine you would endeavour to impose upon me. Here, take the sword—No, now I think on't, I will keep it myself, and show it your officer in the morning, acquainting him, at the same time, what a price you asked me for it."
The serjeant, as we have said, had always his wit (in sensu praedicto) about him, and now plainly saw that Jones was not in the condition he had apprehended him to be; he now, therefore, counterfeited as great surprize as the other had shown, and said, "I am certain, sir, I have not asked you so much out of the way. Besides, you are to consider, it is the
340
only sword I have, and I must run the risque of my officer's displeasure, by going without one myself. And truly, putting all this together, I don't think twenty shillings was so much out of the way."
"Twenty shillings!" cries Jones; "why, you just now asked me twenty guineas."一"How!" cries the serjeant, "sure your honour must have mistaken me: or else I mistook myself一and indeed I am but half awake. Twenty guineas, indeed! no wonder your honour flew into such a passion. I say twenty guineas too. No, no, I mean twenty shillings, I assure you. And when your honour comes to consider everything, I hope you will not think that so extravagant a price. It is indeed true, you may buy a weapon which looks as well for less money. But-"
Here Jones interrupted him, saying, "I will be so far from making any words with you, that I will give you a shilling more than your demand." He then gave him a guinea, bid him return to his bed, and wished him a good march; adding, he hoped to overtake them before the division reached Worcester.
The serjeant very civilly took his leave, fully satisfied with his merchandize, and not a little pleased with his dexterous recovery from that false step into which his opinion of the sick man's light-headedness had betrayed him.
As soon as the serjeant was departed, Jones rose from his bed, and dressed himself entirely, putting on even his coat, which, as its colour was white, showed very visibly the streams of blood which had flowed down it; and now, having grasped his new-purchased sword in his hand, he was going to issue forth, when the thought of what he was about to undertake laid suddenly hold of him, and he began to reflect that in a few minutes he might possibly deprive a human being of life, or might lose his own. "Very well," said he, "and in what cause do I venture my life? Why, in that of my honour. And who is this human being? A rascal who hath injured and insulted me without provocation. But is not revenge forbidden by Heaven? Yes, but it is enjoined by the world. Well, but shall I obey the world in opposition to the express commands of Heaven? Shall I incur the Divine displeasure rather than be called一ha一coward一scoundrel?一I'll think no more; I am resolved, and must fight him."
The clock had now struck twelve, and every one in the house were in their beds, except the centinel who stood to guard Northerton, when Jones softly opening his door, issued forth in pursuit of his enemy, of whose place of confinement he had received a perfect description from
341
the drawer. It is not easy to conceive a much more tremendous figure than he now exhibited. He had on, as we have said, a light-coloured coat, covered with streams of blood. His face, which missed that very blood, as well as twenty ounces more drawn from him by the surgeon, was pallid. Round his head was a quantity of bandage, not unlike a turban. In the right hand he carried a sword, and in the left a candle. So that the bloody Banquo was not worthy to be compared to him. In fact, I believe a more dreadful apparition was never raised in a church-yard, nor in the imagination of any good people met in a winter evening over a Christmas fire in Somersetshire.
When the centinel first saw our heroe approach, his hair began gently to lift up his grenadier cap; and in the same instant his knees fell to blows with each other. Presently his whole body was seized with worse than an ague fit. He then fired his piece, and fell flat on his face.
Whether fear or courage was the occasion of his firing, or whether he took aim at the object of his terror, I cannot say. If he did, however, he had the good fortune to miss his man.
Jones seeing the fellow fall, guessed the cause of his fright, at which he could not forbear smiling, not in the least reflecting on the danger from which he had just escaped. He then passed by the fellow, who still continued in the posture in which he fell, and entered the room where Northerton, as he had heard, was confined. Here, in a solitary situation, he found一an empty quart pot standing on the table, on which some beer being spilt, it looked as if the room had lately been inhabited; but at present it was entirely vacant.
Jones then apprehended it might lead to some other apartment; but upon searching all round it, he could perceive no other door than that at which he entered, and where the centinel had been posted. He then proceeded to call Northerton several times by his name; but no one answered; nor did this serve to any other purpose than to confirm the centinel in his terrors, who was now convinced that the volunteer was dead of his wounds, and that his ghost was come in search of the murderer: he now lay in all the agonies of horror; and I wish, with all my heart, some of those actors who are hereafter to represent a man frighted out of his wits had seen him, that they might be taught to copy nature, instead of performing several antic tricks and gestures, for the entertainment and applause of the galleries.
Perceiving the bird was flown, at least despairing to find him, and rightly apprehending that the report of the firelock would alarm the
342
whole house, our heroe now blew out his candle, and gently stole back again to his chamber, and to his bed; whither he would not have been able to have gotten undiscovered, had any other person been on the same staircase, save only one gentleman who was confined to his bed by the gout; for before he could reach the door to his chamber, the hall where the centinel had been posted was half full of people, some in their shirts, and others not half drest, all very earnestly enquiring of each other what was the matter.
The soldier was now found lying in the same place and posture in which we just now left him. Several immediately applied themselves to raise him, and some concluded him dead; but they presently saw their mistake, for he not only struggled with those who laid their hands on him, but fell a roaring like a bull. In reality, he imagined so many spirits or devils were handling him; for his imagination being possessed with the horror of an apparition, converted every object he saw or felt into nothing but ghosts and spectres.
At length he was overpowered by numbers, and got upon his legs; when candles being brought, and seeing two or three of his comrades present, he came a little to himself; but when they asked him what was the matter? he answered, "I am a dead man, that's all, I am a dead man, I can't recover it, I have seen him." "What hast thou seen, Jack?" says one of the soldiers. "Why, I have seen the young volunteer that was killed yesterday." He then imprecated the most heavy curses on himself, if he had not seen the volunteer, all over blood, vomiting fire out of his mouth and nostrils, pass by him into the chamber where Ensign Northerton was, and then seizing the ensign by the throat, fly away with him in a clap of thunder.
This relation met with a gracious reception from the audience. All the women present believed it firmly, and prayed Heaven to defend them from murder. Amongst the men too, many had faith in the story; but others turned it into derision and ridicule; and a serjeant who was present answered very coolly, "Young man, you will hear more of this, for going to sleep and dreaming on your post."
The soldier replied, "You may punish me if you please; but I was as broad awake as I am now; and the devil carry me away, as he hath the ensign, if I did not see the dead man, as I tell you, with eyes as big and as fiery as two large flambeaux."
The commander of the forces, and the commander of the house, were now both arrived; for the former being awake at the time, and hearing
343
the centinel fire his piece, thought it his duty to rise immediately, though he had no great apprehensions of any mischief; whereas the apprehensions of the latter were much greater, lest her spoons and tankards should be upon the march, without having received any such orders from her.
Our poor centinel, to whom the sight of this officer was not much more welcome than the apparition, as he thought it, which he had seen before, again related the dreadful story, and with many additions of blood and fire; but he had the misfortune to gain no credit with either of the last-mentioned persons: for the officer, though a very religious man, was free from all terrors of this kind; besides, having so lately left Jones in the condition we have seen, he had no suspicion of his being dead. As for the landlady, though not over religious, she had no kind of aversion to the doctrine of spirits; but there was a circumstance in the tale which she well knew to be false, as we shall inform the reader presently.
But whether Northerton was carried away in thunder or fire, or in whatever other manner he was gone, it was now certain that his body was no longer in custody. Upon this occasion the lieutenant formed a conclusion not very different from what the serjeant is just mentioned to have made before, and immediately ordered the centinel to be taken prisoner. So that, by a strange reverse of fortune (though not very uncommon in a military life), the guard became the guarded.
344
15
Chapter 且 U
The conclusion of the foregoing adventure.
Besides the suspicion of sleep, the lieutenant harboured another and worse doubt against the poor centinel, and this was, that of treachery; for as he believed not one syllable of the apparition, so he imagined the whole to be an invention formed only to impose upon him, and that the fellow had in reality been bribed by Northerton to let him escape. And this he imagined the rather, as the fright appeared to him the more unnatural in one who had the character of as brave and bold a man as any in the regiment, having been in several actions, having received several wounds, and, in a word, having behaved himself always like a good and valiant soldier.
That the reader, therefore, may not conceive the least ill opinion of such a person, we shall not delay a moment in rescuing his character from the imputation of this guilt.
Mr Northerton then, as we have before observed, was fully satisfied with the glory which he had obtained from this action. He had perhaps seen, or heard, or guessed, that envy is apt to attend fame. Not that I would here insinuate that he was heathenishly inclined to believe in or to worship the goddess Nemesis; for, in fact, I am convinced he never heard of her name. He was, besides, of an active disposition, and had a great antipathy to those close quarters in the castle of Gloucester, for which a justice of peace might possibly give him a billet. Nor was he moreover free from some uneasy meditations on a certain wooden edifice, which I forbear to name, in conformity to the opinion of mankind, who, I think, rather ought to honour than to be ashamed of this building, as it is, or at least might be made, of more benefit to society than almost any other public erection. In a word, to hint at no more reasons for his conduct, Mr Northerton was desirous of departing that evening, and nothing remained for him but to contrive the quomodo, which appeared to be a matter of some difficulty.
345
Now this young gentleman, though somewhat crooked in his morals, was perfectly straight in his person, which was extremely strong and well made. His face too was accounted handsome by the generality of women, for it was broad and ruddy, with tolerably good teeth. Such charms did not fail making an impression on my landlady, who had no little relish for this kind of beauty. She had, indeed, a real compassion for the young man; and hearing from the surgeon that affairs were like to go ill with the volunteer, she suspected they might hereafter wear no benign aspect with the ensign. Having obtained, therefore, leave to make him a visit, and finding him in a very melancholy mood, which she considerably heightened by telling him there were scarce any hopes of the volunteer's life, she proceeded to throw forth some hints, which the other readily and eagerly taking up, they soon came to a right understanding; and it was at length agreed that the ensign should, at a certain signal, ascend the chimney, which communicating very soon with that of the kitchen, he might there again let himself down; for which she would give him an opportunity by keeping the coast clear.
But lest our readers, of a different complexion, should take this occasion of too hastily condemning all compassion as a folly, and pernicious to society, we think proper to mention another particular which might possibly have some little share in this action. The ensign happened to be at this time possessed of the sum of fifty pounds, which did indeed belong to the whole company; for the captain having quarrelled with his lieutenant, had entrusted the payment of his company to the ensign. This money, however, he thought proper to deposit in my landlady's hand, possibly by way of bail or security that he would hereafter appear and answer to the charge against him; but whatever were the conditions, certain it is, that she had the money and the ensign his liberty.
The reader may perhaps expect, from the compassionate temper of this good woman, that when she saw the poor centinel taken prisoner for a fact of which she knew him innocent, she should immediately have interposed in his behalf; but whether it was that she had already exhausted all her compassion in the above-mentioned instance, or that the features of this fellow, though not very different from those of the ensign, could not raise it, I will not determine; but, far from being an advocate for the present prisoner, she urged his guilt to his officer, declaring, with uplifted eyes and hands, that she would not have had any concern in the escape of a murderer for all the world.
Everything was now once more quiet, and most of the company returned again to their beds; but the landlady, either from the natural
346
activity of her disposition, or from her fear for her plate, having no propensity to sleep, prevailed with the officers, as they were to march within little more than an hour, to spend that time with her over a bowl of punch.
Jones had lain awake all this while, and had heard great part of the hurry and bustle that had passed, of which he had now some curiosity to know the particulars. He therefore applied to his bell, which he rung at least twenty times without any effect: for my landlady was in such high mirth with her company, that no clapper could be heard there but her own; and the drawer and chambermaid, who were sitting together in the kitchen (for neither durst he sit up nor she lie in bed alone), the more they heard the bell ring the more they were frightened, and as it were nailed down in their places.
At last, at a lucky interval of chat, the sound reached the ears of our good landlady, who presently sent forth her summons, which both her servants instantly obeyed. "Joe," says the mistress, "don't you hear the gentleman's bell ring? Why don't you go up?"一"It is not my business," answered the drawer, "to wait upon the chambers一it is Betty Chambermaid's."一"If you come to that," answered the maid, "it is not my business to wait upon gentlemen. I have done it indeed sometimes; but the devil fetch me if ever I do again, since you make your preambles about it." The bell still ringing violently, their mistress fell into a passion, and swore, if the drawer did not go up immediately, she would turn him away that very morning. "If you do, madam," says he, "I can't help it. I won't do another servant's business." She then applied herself to the maid, and endeavoured to prevail by gentle means; but all in vain: Betty was as inflexible as Joe. Both insisted it was not their business, and they would not do it.
The lieutenant then fell a laughing, and said, "Come, I will put an end to this contention;" and then turning to the servants, commended them for their resolution in not giving up the point; but added, he was sure, if one would consent to go the other would. To which proposal they both agreed in an instant, and accordingly went up very lovingly and close together. When they were gone, the lieutenant appeased the wrath of the landlady, by satisfying her why they were both so unwilling to go alone.
They returned soon after, and acquainted their mistress, that the sick gentleman was so far from being dead, that he spoke as heartily as if he was well; and that he gave his service to the captain, and should be very glad of the favour of seeing him before he marched.
347
The good lieutenant immediately complied with his desires, and sitting down by his bed-side, acquainted him with the scene which had happened below, concluding with his intentions to make an example of the centinel.
Upon this Jones related to him the whole truth, and earnestly begged him not to punish the poor soldier, "who, I am confident," says he, "is as innocent of the ensign's escape, as he is of forging any lie, or of endeavouring to impose on you."
The lieutenant hesitated a few moments, and then answered: "Why, as you have cleared the fellow of one part of the charge, so it will be impossible to prove the other, because he was not the only centinel. But I have a good mind to punish the rascal for being a coward. Yet who knows what effect the terror of such an apprehension may have? and, to say the truth, he hath always behaved well against an enemy. Come, it is a good thing to see any sign of religion in these fellows; so I promise you he shall be set at liberty when we march. But hark, the general beats. My dear boy, give me another buss. Don't discompose nor hurry yourself; but remember the Christian doctrine of patience, and I warrant you will soon be able to do yourself justice, and to take an honourable revenge on the fellow who hath injured you." The lieutenant then departed, and Jones endeavoured to compose himself to rest.

Part 8

Chapter 且
A wonderful long chapter concerning the marvellous; being much the longest of all our introductory chapters.
As we are now entering upon a book in which the course of our history will oblige us to relate some matters of a more strange and surprizing kind than any which have hitherto occurred, it may not be amiss, in the prolegomenous or introductory chapter, to say something of that species of writing which is called the marvellous. To this we shall, as well for the sake of ourselves as of others, endeavour to set some certain bounds, and indeed nothing can be more necessary, as critics 8 of different complexions are here apt to run into very different extremes; for while some are, with M. Dacier, ready to allow, that the same thing which is impossible may be yet probable, 9 others have so little historic or poetic faith, that they believe nothing to be either possible or probable, the like to which hath not occurred to their own observation.
First, then, I think it may very reasonably be required of every writer, that he keeps within the bounds of possibility; and still remembers that what it is not possible for man to perform, it is scarce possible for man to believe he did perform. This conviction perhaps gave birth to many stories of the antient heathen deities (for most of them are of poetical original). The poet, being desirous to indulge a wanton and extravagant imagination, took refuge in that power, of the extent of which his readers were no judges, or rather which they imagined to be infinite, and consequently they could not be shocked at any prodigies related of it. This hath been strongly urged in defence of Homer's miracles; and it is perhaps a defence; not, as Mr Pope would have it, because Ulysses told a set of foolish lies to the Phaeacians, who were a very dull nation; but because the poet himself wrote to heathens, to whom poetical fables were
8.By this word here, and in most other parts of our work, we mean every reader in the world.
9.It is happy for M. Dacier that he was not an Irishman.
350
articles of faith. For my own part, I must confess, so compassionate is my temper, I wish Polypheme had confined himself to his milk diet, and preserved his eye; nor could Ulysses be much more concerned than myself, when his companions were turned into swine by Circe, who showed, I think, afterwards, too much regard for man's flesh to be supposed capable of converting it into bacon. I wish, likewise, with all my heart, that Homer could have known the rule prescribed by Horace, to introduce supernatural agents as seldom as possible. We should not then have seen his gods coming on trivial errands, and often behaving themselves so as not only to forfeit all title to respect, but to become the objects of scorn and derision. A conduct which must have shocked the credulity of a pious and sagacious heathen; and which could never have been defended, unless by agreeing with a supposition to which I have been sometimes almost inclined, that this most glorious poet, as he certainly was, had an intent to burlesque the superstitious faith of his own age and country.
But I have rested too long on a doctrine which can be of no use to a Christian writer; for as he cannot introduce into his works any of that heavenly host which make a part of his creed, so it is horrid puerility to search the heathen theology for any of those deities who have been long since dethroned from their immortality. Lord Shaftesbury observes, that nothing is more cold than the invocation of a muse by a modern; he might have added, that nothing can be more absurd. A modern may with much more elegance invoke a ballad, as some have thought Homer did, or a mug of ale, with the author of Hudibras; which latter may perhaps have inspired much more poetry, as well as prose, than all the liquors of Hippocrene or Helicon.
The only supernatural agents which can in any manner be allowed to us moderns, are ghosts; but of these I would advise an author to be extremely sparing. These are indeed, like arsenic, and other dangerous drugs in physic, to be used with the utmost caution; nor would I advise the introduction of them at all in those works, or by those authors, to which, or to whom, a horse-laugh in the reader would be any great prejudice or mortification.
As for elves and fairies, and other such mummery, I purposely omit the mention of them, as I should be very unwilling to confine within any bounds those surprizing imaginations, for whose vast capacity the limits of human nature are too narrow; whose works are to be considered as a new creation; and who have consequently just right to do what they will with their own.
351
Man therefore is the highest subject (unless on very extraordinary occasions indeed) which presents itself to the pen of our historian, or of our poet; and, in relating his actions, great care is to be taken that we do not exceed the capacity of the agent we describe.
Nor is possibility alone sufficient to justify us; we must keep likewise within the rules of probability. It is, I think, the opinion of Aristotle; or if not, it is the opinion of some wise man, whose authority will be as weighty when it is as old, "That it is no excuse for a poet who relates what is incredible, that the thing related is really matter of fact." This may perhaps be allowed true with regard to poetry, but it may be thought impracticable to extend it to the historian; for he is obliged to record matters as he finds them, though they may be of so extraordinary a nature as will require no small degree of historical faith to swallow them. Such was the successless armament of Xerxes described by Herodotus, or the successful expedition of Alexander related by Arrian. Such of later years was the victory of Agincourt obtained by Harry the Fifth, or that of Narva won by Charles the Twelfth of Sweden. All which instances, the more we reflect on them, appear still the more astonishing.
Such facts, however, as they occur in the thread of the story, nay, indeed, as they constitute the essential parts of it, the historian is not only justifiable in recording as they really happened, but indeed would be unpardonable should he omit or alter them. But there are other facts not of such consequence nor so necessary, which, though ever so well attested, may nevertheless be sacrificed to oblivion in complacence to the scepticism of a reader. Such is that memorable story of the ghost of George Villiers, which might with more propriety have been made a present of to Dr Drelincourt, to have kept the ghost of Mrs Veale company, at the head of his Discourse upon Death, than have been introduced into so solemn a work as the History of the Rebellion.
To say the truth, if the historian will confine himself to what really happened, and utterly reject any circumstance, which, though never so well attested, he must be well assured is false, he will sometimes fall into the marvellous, but never into the incredible. He will often raise the wonder and surprize of his reader, but never that incredulous hatred mentioned by Horace. It is by falling into fiction, therefore, that we generally offend against this rule, of deserting probability, which the historian seldom, if ever, quits, till he forsakes his character and commences a writer of romance. In this, however, those historians who relate public transactions, have the advantage of us who confine ourselves to scenes of private life. The credit of the former is by common notoriety supported
352
for a long time; and public records, with the concurrent testimony of many authors, bear evidence to their truth in future ages. Thus a Trajan and an Antoninus, a Nero and a Caligula, have all met with the belief of posterity; and no one doubts but that men so very good, and so very bad, were once the masters of mankind.
But we who deal in private character, who search into the most retired recesses, and draw forth examples of virtue and vice from holes and corners of the world, are in a more dangerous situation. As we have no public notoriety, no concurrent testimony, no records to support and corroborate what we deliver, it becomes us to keep within the limits not only of possibility, but of probability too; and this more especially in painting what is greatly good and amiable. Knavery and folly, though never so exorbitant, will more easily meet with assent; for ill-nature adds great support and strength to faith.
Thus we may, perhaps, with little danger, relate the history of Fisher; who having long owed his bread to the generosity of Mr Derby, and having one morning received a considerable bounty from his hands, yet, in order to possess himself of what remained in his friend's scrutore, concealed himself in a public office of the Temple, through which there was a passage into Mr Derby's chambers. Here he overheard Mr Derby for many hours solacing himself at an entertainment which he that evening gave his friends, and to which Fisher had been invited. During all this time, no tender, no grateful reflections arose to restrain his purpose; but when the poor gentleman had let his company out through the office, Fisher came suddenly from his lurking-place, and walking softly behind his friend into his chamber, discharged a pistol-ball into his head. This may be believed when the bones of Fisher are as rotten as his heart. Nay, perhaps, it will be credited, that the villain went two days afterwards with some young ladies to the play of Hamlet; and with an unaltered countenance heard one of the ladies, who little suspected how near she was to the person, cry out, "Good God! if the man that murdered Mr Derby was now present!" manifesting in this a more seared and callous conscience than even Nero himself; of whom we are told by Suetonius, "that the consciousness of his guilt, after the death of his mother, became immediately intolerable, and so continued; nor could all the congratulations of the soldiers, of the senate, and the people, allay the horrors of his conscience."
But now, on the other hand, should I tell my reader, that I had known a man whose penetrating genius had enabled him to raise a large fortune in a way where no beginning was chaulked out to him; that he had done
353
this with the most perfect preservation of his integrity, and not only without the least injustice or injury to any one individual person, but with the highest advantage to trade, and a vast increase of the public revenue; that he had expended one part of the income of this fortune in discovering a taste superior to most, by works where the highest dignity was united with the purest simplicity, and another part in displaying a degree of goodness superior to all men, by acts of charity to objects whose only recommendations were their merits, or their wants; that he was most industrious in searching after merit in distress, most eager to relieve it, and then as careful (perhaps too careful) to conceal what he had done; that his house, his furniture, his gardens, his table, his private hospitality, and his public beneficence, all denoted the mind from which they flowed, and were all intrinsically rich and noble, without tinsel, or external ostentation; that he filled every relation in life with the most adequate virtue; that he was most piously religious to his Creator, most zealously loyal to his sovereign; a most tender husband to his wife, a kind relation, a munificent patron, a warm and firm friend, a knowing and a chearful companion, indulgent to his servants, hospitable to his neighbours, charitable to the poor, and benevolent to all mankind. Should I add to these the epithets of wise, brave, elegant, and indeed every other amiable epithet in our language, I might surely say,
一Quis credet? nemo Hercule! nemo; Vel duo, vel nemo;
and yet I know a man who is all I have here described. But a single instance (and I really know not such another) is not sufficient to justify us, while we are writing to thousands who never heard of the person, nor of anything like him. Such rarae aves should be remitted to the epitaph writer, or to some poet who may condescend to hitch him in a distich, or to slide him into a rhime with an air of carelessness and neglect, without giving any offence to the reader.
In the last place, the actions should be such as may not only be within the compass of human agency, and which human agents may probably be supposed to do; but they should be likely for the very actors and characters themselves to have performed; for what may be only wonderful and surprizing in one man, may become improbable, or indeed impossible, when related of another.
This last requisite is what the dramatic critics call conversation of character; and it requires a very extraordinary degree of judgment, and a most exact knowledge of human nature.
354
It is admirably remarked by a most excellent writer, that zeal can no more hurry a man to act in direct opposition to itself, than a rapid stream can carry a boat against its own current. I will venture to say, that for a man to act in direct contradiction to the dictates of his nature, is, if not impossible, as improbable and as miraculous as anything which can well be conceived. Should the best parts of the story of M. Antoninus be ascribed to Nero, or should the worst incidents of Nero's life be imputed to Antoninus, what would be more shocking to belief than either instance? whereas both these being related of their proper agent, constitute the truly marvellous.
Our modern authors of comedy have fallen almost universally into the error here hinted at; their heroes generally are notorious rogues, and their heroines abandoned jades, during the first four acts; but in the fifth, the former become very worthy gentlemen, and the latter women of virtue and discretion: nor is the writer often so kind as to give himself the least trouble to reconcile or account for this monstrous change and incongruity. There is, indeed, no other reason to be assigned for it, than because the play is drawing to a conclusion; as if it was no less natural in a rogue to repent in the last act of a play, than in the last of his life; which we perceive to be generally the case at Tyburn, a place which might indeed close the scene of some comedies with much propriety, as the heroes in these are most commonly eminent for those very talents which not only bring men to the gallows, but enable them to make an heroic figure when they are there.
Within these few restrictions, I think, every writer may be permitted to deal as much in the wonderful as he pleases; nay, if he thus keeps within the rules of credibility, the more he can surprize the reader the more he will engage his attention, and the more he will charm him. As a genius of the highest rank observes in his fifth chapter of the Bathos, "The great art of all poetry is to mix truth with fiction, in order to join the credible with the surprizing."
For though every good author will confine himself within the bounds of probability, it is by no means necessary that his characters, or his incidents, should be trite, common, or vulgar; such as happen in every street, or in every house, or which may be met with in the home articles of a newspaper. Nor must he be inhibited from showing many persons and things, which may possibly have never fallen within the knowledge of great part of his readers. If the writer strictly observes the rules abovementioned, he hath discharged his part; and is then intitled to some faith
355
from his reader, who is indeed guilty of critical infidelity if he disbelieves him.
For want of a portion of such faith, I remember the character of a young lady of quality, which was condemned on the stage for being unnatural, by the unanimous voice of a very large assembly of clerks and apprentices; though it had the previous suffrages of many ladies of the first rank; one of whom, very eminent for her understanding, declared it was the picture of half the young people of her acquaintance.

Chapter
In which the landlady pays a visit to Mr Jones.
When Jones had taken leave of his friend the lieutenant, he endeavoured to close his eyes, but all in vain; his spirits were too lively and wakeful to be lulled to sleep. So having amused, or rather tormented, himself with the thoughts of his Sophia till it was open daylight, he called for some tea; upon which occasion my landlady herself vouchsafed to pay him a visit.
This was indeed the first time she had seen him, or at least had taken any notice of him; but as the lieutenant had assured her that he was certainly some young gentleman of fashion, she now determined to show him all the respect in her power; for, to speak truly, this was one of those houses where gentlemen, to use the language of advertisements, meet with civil treatment for their money.
She had no sooner begun to make his tea, than she likewise began to discourse:一"La! sir," said she, "I think it is great pity that such a pretty young gentleman should under-value himself so, as to go about with these soldier fellows. They call themselves gentlemen, I warrant you; but, as my first husband used to say, they should remember it is we that pay them. And to be sure it is very hard upon us to be obliged to pay them, and to keep 'um too, as we publicans are. I had twenty of 'um last night, besides officers: nay, for matter o' that, I had rather have the soldiers than officers: for nothing is ever good enough for those sparks; and I am sure, if you was to see the bills; la! sir, it is nothing. I have had less trouble, I warrant you, with a good squire's family, where we take forty or fifty shillings of a night, besides horses. And yet I warrants me, there is narrow a one of those officer fellows but looks upon himself to be as good as arrow a squire of £500 a year. To be sure it doth me good to hear their men run about after 'um, crying your honour, and your honour. Marry come up with such honour, and an ordinary at a shilling a head. Then there's such swearing among 'um, to be sure it frightens me out o' my wits: I thinks nothing can ever prosper with such wicked people.
357
And here one of 'um has used you in so barbarous a manner. I thought indeed how well the rest would secure him; they all hang together; for if you had been in danger of death, which I am glad to see you are not, it would have been all as one to such wicked people. They would have let the murderer go. Laud have mercy upon 'um; I would not have such a sin to answer for, for the whole world. But though you are likely, with the blessing, to recover, there is laa for him yet; and if you will employ lawyer Small, I darest be sworn he'll make the fellow fly the country for him; though perhaps he'll have fled the country before; for it is here today and gone to-morrow with such chaps. I hope, however, you will learn more wit for the future, and return back to your friends; I warrant they are all miserable for your loss; and if they was but to know what had happened一La, my seeming! I would not for the world they should. Come, come, we know very well what all the matter is; but if one won't, another will; so pretty a gentleman need never want a lady. I am sure, if I was you, I would see the finest she that ever wore a head hanged, before I would go for a soldier for her.—Nay, don't blush so" (for indeed he did to a violent degree). "Why, you thought, sir, I knew nothing of the matter, I warrant you, about Madam Sophia."一"How," says Jones, starting up, "do you know my Sophia?"一"Do I! ay marry," cries the landlady; "many's the time hath she lain in this house."—"With her aunt, I suppose," says Jones. "Why, there it is now," cries the landlady. "Ay, ay, ay, I know the old lady very well. And a sweet young creature is Madam Sophia, that's the truth on't."一"A sweet creature," cries Jones; "O heavens!"
Angels are painted fair to look like her. There's in her all that we believe of heav'n, Amazing brightness, purity, and truth, Eternal joy and everlasting love.
"And could I ever have imagined that you had known my Sophia!"一"I wish," says the landlady, "you knew half so much of her. What would you have given to have sat by her bed-side? What a delicious neck she hath! Her lovely limbs have stretched themselves in that very bed you now lie in."一"Here!" cries Jones: "hath Sophia ever laid here?"一"Ay, ay, here; there, in that very bed," says the landlady; "where I wish you had her this moment; and she may wish so too for anything I know to the contrary, for she hath mentioned your name to me."一"Ha!" cries he; "did she ever mention her poor Jones? You flatter me now: I can never believe so much."一"Why, then," answered she, "as I hope to be saved, and may the devil fetch me if I speak a syllable more than the truth, I have heard her mention Mr Jones; but in a civil and modest way, I confess; yet I
358
could perceive she thought a great deal more than she said."一"O my dear woman!" cries Jones, "her thoughts of me I shall never be worthy of. Oh, she is all gentleness, kindness, goodness! Why was such a rascal as I born, ever to give her soft bosom a moment's uneasiness? Why am I cursed? I, who would undergo all the plagues and miseries which any daemon ever invented for mankind, to procure her any good; nay, torture itself could not be misery to me, did I but know that she was happy."一"Why, look you there now," says the landlady; "I told her you was a constant lovier."一"But pray, madam, tell me when or where you knew anything of me; for I never was here before, nor do I remember ever to have seen you."—"Nor is it possible you should," answered she; "for you was a little thing when I had you in my lap at the squire's."一"How, the squire's?" says Jones: "what, do you know that great and good Mr Allworthy then?"一"Yes, marry, do I," says she: "who in the country doth not?"一"The fame of his goodness indeed," answered Jones, "must have extended farther than this; but heaven only can know him一can know that benevolence which it copied from itself, and sent upon earth as its own pattern. Mankind are as ignorant of such divine goodness, as they are unworthy of it; but none so unworthy of it as myself. I, who was raised by him to such a height; taken in, as you must well know, a poor base-born child, adopted by him, and treated as his own son, to dare by my follies to disoblige him, to draw his vengeance upon me. Yes, I deserve it all; for I will never be so ungrateful as ever to think he hath done an act of injustice by me. No, I deserve to be turned out of doors, as I am. And now, madam," says he, "I believe you will not blame me for turning soldier, especially with such a fortune as this in my pocket." At which words he shook a purse, which had but very little in it, and which still appeared to the landlady to have less.
My good landlady was (according to vulgar phrase) struck all of a heap by this relation. She answered coldly, "That to be sure people were the best judges what was most proper for their circumstances. But hark," says she, "I think I hear somebody call. Coming! coming! the devil's in all our volk; nobody hath any ears. I must go down-stairs; if you want any more breakfast the maid will come up. Coming!" At which words, without taking any leave, she flung out of the room; for the lower sort of people are very tenacious of respect; and though they are contented to give this gratis to persons of quality, yet they never confer it on those of their own order without taking care to be well paid for their pains.

Chapter U
In which the surgeon makes his second appearance.
Before we proceed any farther, that the reader may not be mistaken in imagining the landlady knew more than she did, nor surprized that she knew so much, it may be necessary to inform him that the lieutenant had acquainted her that the name of Sophia had been the occasion of the quarrel; and as for the rest of her knowledge, the sagacious reader will observe how she came by it in the preceding scene. Great curiosity was indeed mixed with her virtues; and she never willingly suffered any one to depart from her house, without enquiring as much as possible into their names, families, and fortunes.
She was no sooner gone than Jones, instead of animadverting on her behaviour, reflected that he was in the same bed which he was informed had held his dear Sophia. This occasioned a thousand fond and tender thoughts, which we would dwell longer upon, did we not consider that such kind of lovers will make a very inconsiderable part of our readers. In this situation the surgeon found him, when he came to dress his wound. The doctor perceiving, upon examination, that his pulse was disordered, and hearing that he had not slept, declared that he was in great danger; for he apprehended a fever was coming on, which he would have prevented by bleeding, but Jones would not submit, declaring he would lose no more blood; "and, doctor," says he, "if you will be so kind only to dress my head, I have no doubt of being well in a day or two."
"I wish," answered the surgeon, "I could assure your being well in a month or two. Well, indeed! No, no, people are not so soon well of such contusions; but, sir, I am not at this time of day to be instructed in my operations by a patient, and I insist on making a revulsion before I dress you."
Jones persisted obstinately in his refusal, and the doctor at last yielded; telling him at the same time that he would not be answerable for the ill consequence, and hoped he would do him the justice to acknowledge
360
that he had given him a contrary advice; which the patient promised he would.
The doctor retired into the kitchen, where, addressing himself to the landlady, he complained bitterly of the undutiful behaviour of his patient, who would not be blooded, though he was in a fever.
"It is an eating fever then," says the landlady; "for he hath devoured two swinging buttered toasts this morning for breakfast."
"Very likely," says the doctor: "I have known people eat in a fever; and it is very easily accounted for; because the acidity occasioned by the febrile matter may stimulate the nerves of the diaphragm, and thereby occasion a craving which will not be easily distinguishable from a natural appetite; but the aliment will not be concreted, nor assimilated into chyle, and so will corrode the vascular orifices, and thus will aggravate the feb-rific symptoms. Indeed, I think the gentleman in a very dangerous way, and, if he is not blooded, I am afraid will die."
"Every man must die some time or other," answered the good woman; "it is no business of mine. I hope, doctor, you would not have me hold him while you bleed him. But, hark'ee, a word in your ear; I would advise you, before you proceed too far, to take care who is to be your paymaster."
"Paymaster!" said the doctor, staring; "why, I've a gentleman under my hands, have I not?"
"I imagined so as well as you," said the landlady; "but, as my first husband used to say, everything is not what it looks to be. He is an arrant scrub, I assure you. However, take no notice that I mentioned anything to you of the matter; but I think people in business oft always to let one another know such things."
"And have I suffered such a fellow as this," cries the doctor, in a passion, "to instruct me? Shall I hear my practice insulted by one who will not pay me? I am glad I have made this discovery in time. I will see now whether he will be blooded or no." He then immediately went upstairs, and flinging open the door of the chamber with much violence, awaked poor Jones from a very sound nap, into which he was fallen, and, what was still worse, from a delicious dream concerning Sophia.
"Will you be blooded or no?" cries the doctor, in a rage. "I have told you my resolution already," answered Jones, "and I wish with all my heart you had taken my answer; for you have awaked me out of the sweetest sleep which I ever had in my life."
361
"Ay, ay," cries the doctor; "many a man hath dozed away his life. Sleep is not always good, no more than food; but remember, I demand of you for the last time, will you be blooded?"—"I answer you for the last time," said Jones, "I will not."一"Then I wash my hands of you," cries the doctor; "and I desire you to pay me for the trouble I have had already. Two journeys at 5s. each, two dressings at 5s. more, and half a crown for phlebotomy."一"I hope," said Jones, "you don't intend to leave me in this condition."—"Indeed but I shall," said the other. "Then," said Jones, "you have used me rascally, and I will not pay you a farthing."一"Very well," cries the doctor; "the first loss is the best. What a pox did my landlady mean by sending for me to such vagabonds!" At which words he flung out of the room, and his patient turning himself about soon recovered his sleep; but his dream was unfortunately gone.
362
In which is introduced one of the pleasantest barbers that was ever recorded in history, the barber of Bagdad, or he in Don Quixote, not excepted.
The clock had now struck five when Jones awaked from a nap of seven hours, so much refreshed, and in such perfect health and spirits, that he resolved to get up and dress himself; for which purpose he unlocked his portmanteau, and took out clean linen, and a suit of cloaths; but first he slipt on a frock, and went down into the kitchen to bespeak something that might pacify certain tumults he found rising within his stomach.
Meeting the landlady, he accosted her with great civility, and asked, "What he could have for dinner?"—"For dinner!" says she; "it is an odd time a day to think about dinner. There is nothing drest in the house, and the fire is almost out."一"Well, but," says he, "I must have something to eat, and it is almost indifferent to me what; for, to tell you the truth, I was never more hungry in my life."一"Then," says she, "I believe there is a piece of cold buttock and carrot, which will fit you."—"Nothing better," answered Jones; "but I should be obliged to you, if you would let it be fried." To which the landlady consented, and said, smiling, "she was glad to see him so well recovered;" for the sweetness of our heroe's temper was almost irresistible; besides, she was really no ill-humoured woman at the bottom; but she loved money so much, that she hated everything which had the semblance of poverty.
Jones now returned in order to dress himself, while his dinner was preparing, and was, according to his orders, attended by the barber.
This barber, who went by the name of Little Benjamin, was a fellow of great oddity and humour, which had frequently let him into small incon-veniencies, such as slaps in the face, kicks in the breech, broken bones, &amp;c. For every one doth not understand a jest; and those who do are often displeased with being themselves the subjects of it. This vice was, however, incurable in him; and though he had often smarted for it, yet if
363
ever he conceived a joke, he was certain to be delivered of it, without the least respect of persons, time, or place.
He had a great many other particularities in his character, which I shall not mention, as the reader will himself very easily perceive them, on his farther acquaintance with this extraordinary person.
Jones being impatient to be drest, for a reason which may be easily imagined, thought the shaver was very tedious in preparing his suds, and begged him to make haste; to which the other answered with much gravity, for he never discomposed his muscles on any account, "Festina lente, is a proverb which I learned long before I ever touched a razor."一"I find, friend, you are a scholar," replied Jones. "A poor one," said the barber, "non omnia possumus omnes.''一"Again!" said Jones; "I fancy you are good at capping verses."一"Excuse me, sir," said the barber, "non tanto me dignor honore." And then proceeding to his operation, "Sir," said he, "since I have dealt in suds, I could never discover more than two reasons for shaving; the one is to get a beard, and the other to get rid of one. I conjecture, sir, it may not be long since you shaved from the former of these motives. Upon my word, you have had good success; for one may say of your beard, that it is tondenti gravior."—"I conjecture," says Jones, "that thou art a very comical fellow."一"You mistake me widely, sir," said the barber: "I am too much addicted to the study of philosophy; hinc illae lacrymae, sir; that's my misfortune. Too much learning hath been my ruin."一"Indeed," says Jones, "I confess, friend, you have more learning than generally belongs to your trade; but I can't see how it can have injured you."—"Alas! sir," answered the shaver, "my father disinherited me for it. He was a dancing-master; and because I could read before I could dance, he took an aversion to me, and left every farthing among his other children.一Will you please to have your temples一O la! I ask your pardon, I fancy there is hiatus in manuscriptis. I heard you was going to the wars; but I find it was a mistake."一"Why do you conclude so?" says Jones. "Sure, sir," answered the barber, "you are too wise a man to carry a broken head thither; for that would be carrying coals to Newcastle."
"Upon my word," cries Jones, "thou art a very odd fellow, and I like thy humour extremely; I shall be very glad if thou wilt come to me after dinner, and drink a glass with me; I long to be better acquainted with thee."
"O dear sir!" said the barber, "I can do you twenty times as great a favour, if you will accept of it."一"What is that, my friend?" cries Jones. "Why, I will drink a bottle with you if you please; for I dearly love good
364
nature; and as you have found me out to be a comical fellow, so I have no skill in physiognomy, if you are not one of the best-natured gentlemen in the universe." Jones now walked downstairs neatly drest, and perhaps the fair Adonis was not a lovelier figure; and yet he had no charms for my landlady; for as that good woman did not resemble Venus at all in her person, so neither did she in her taste. Happy had it been for Nanny the chambermaid, if she had seen with the eyes of her mistress, for that poor girl fell so violently in love with Jones in five minutes, that her passion afterwards cost her many a sigh. This Nanny was extremely pretty, and altogether as coy; for she had refused a drawer, and one or two young farmers in the neighbourhood, but the bright eyes of our heroe thawed all her ice in a moment.
When Jones returned to the kitchen, his cloth was not yet laid; nor indeed was there any occasion it should, his dinner remaining in statu quo, as did the fire which was to dress it. This disappointment might have put many a philosophical temper into a passion; but it had no such effect on Jones. He only gave the landlady a gentle rebuke, saying, "Since it was so difficult to get it heated he would eat the beef cold." But now the good woman, whether moved by compassion, or by shame, or by whatever other motive, I cannot tell, first gave her servants a round scold for disobeying the orders which she had never given, and then bidding the drawer lay a napkin in the Sun, she set about the matter in good earnest, and soon accomplished it.
This Sun, into which Jones was now conducted, was truly named, as lucus a non lucendo; for it was an apartment into which the sun had scarce ever looked. It was indeed the worst room in the house; and happy was it for Jones that it was so. However, he was now too hungry to find any fault; but having once satisfied his appetite, he ordered the drawer to carry a bottle of wine into a better room, and expressed some resentment at having been shown into a dungeon.
The drawer having obeyed his commands, he was, after some time, attended by the barber, who would not indeed have suffered him to wait so long for his company had he not been listening in the kitchen to the landlady, who was entertaining a circle that she had gathered round her with the history of poor Jones, part of which she had extracted from his own lips, and the other part was her own ingenious composition; for she said "he was a poor parish boy, taken into the house of Squire Allworthy, where he was bred up as an apprentice, and now turned out of doors for his misdeeds, particularly for making love to his young mistress, and probably for robbing the house; for how else should he come by the little
365
money he hath; and this," says she, "is your gentleman, forsooth!"一"A servant of Squire Allworthy!" says the barber; "what's his name?"一"Why he told me his name was Jones," says she: "perhaps he goes by a wrong name. Nay, and he told me, too, that the squire had maintained him as his own son, thof he had quarrelled with him now."一"And if his name be Jones, he told you the truth," said the barber; "for I have relations who live in that country; nay, and some people say he is his son."一"Why doth he not go by the name of his father?"一"I can't tell that," said the barber; "many people's sons don't go by the name of their father."—"Nay," said the landlady, "if I thought he was a gentleman's son, thof he was a byeblow, I should behave to him in another guess manner; for many of these bye-blows come to be great men, and, as my poor first husband used to say, never affront any customer that's a gentleman."

Chapter U
A dialogue between Mr Jones and the barber.
This conversation passed partly while Jones was at dinner in his dungeon, and partly while he was expecting the barber in the parlour. And, as soon as it was ended, Mr Benjamin, as we have said, attended him, and was very kindly desired to sit down. Jones then filling out a glass of wine, drank his health by the appellation of doctissime tonsorum. ''Ago tibi gratias, domine" said the barber; and then looking very steadfastly at Jones, he said, with great gravity, and with a seeming surprize, as if he had recollected a face he had seen before, "Sir, may I crave the favour to know if your name is not Jones?" To which the other answered, "That it was."一''Proh deum atque hominum fidem!'' says the barber; "how strangely things come to pass! Mr Jones, I am your most obedient servant. I find you do not know me, which indeed is no wonder, since you never saw me but once, and then you was very young. Pray, sir, how doth the good Squire Allworthy? how doth ille optimus omnium patronus?''一"I find," said Jones, "you do indeed know me; but I have not the like happiness of recollecting you."一"I do not wonder at that," cries Benjamin; "but I am surprized I did not know you sooner, for you are not in the least altered. And pray, sir, may I, without offence, enquire whither you are travelling this way?"一"Fill the glass, Mr Barber," said Jones, "and ask no more questions."一"Nay, sir," answered Benjamin, "I would not be troublesome; and I hope you don't think me a man of an impertinent curiosity, for that is a vice which nobody can lay to my charge; but I ask pardon; for when a gentleman of your figure travels without his servants, we may suppose him to be, as we say, in casu incognito, and perhaps I ought not to have mentioned your name."一"I own," says Jones, "I did not expect to have been so well known in this country as I find I am; yet, for particular reasons, I shall be obliged to you if you will not mention my name to any other person till I am gone from hence."一"Pauca verba," answered the barber;" and I wish no other here knew you but myself; for some people have tongues; but I promise you I can keep a secret. My

enemies will allow me that virtue."—"And yet that is not the characteristic of your profession, Mr Barber," answered Jones. "Alas! sir," replied Benjamin, "Non si male nunc et olim sic erit. I was not born nor bred a barber, I assure you. I have spent most of my time among gentlemen, and though I say it, I understand something of gentility. And if you had thought me as worthy of your confidence as you have some other people, I should have shown you I could have kept a secret better. I should not have degraded your name in a public kitchen; for indeed, sir, some people have not used you well; for besides making a public proclamation of what you told them of a quarrel between yourself and Squire Allworthy, they added lies of their own, things which I knew to be lies."一"You surprize me greatly," cries Jones. "Upon my word, sir," answered Benjamin, "I tell the truth, and I need not tell you my landlady was the person. I am sure it moved me to hear the story, and I hope it is all false; for I have a great respect for you, I do assure you I have, and have had ever since the good-nature you showed to Black George, which was talked of all over the country, and I received more than one letter about it. Indeed, it made you beloved by everybody. You will pardon me, therefore; for it was real concern at what I heard made me ask many questions; for I have no impertinent curiosity about me: but I love goodnature and thence became amoris abundantia erga te."
Every profession of friendship easily gains credit with the miserable; it is no wonder therefore, if Jones, who, besides his being miserable, was extremely open-hearted, very readily believed all the professions of Benjamin, and received him into his bosom. The scraps of Latin, some of which Benjamin applied properly enough, though it did not savour of profound literature, seemed yet to indicate something superior to a common barber; and so indeed did his whole behaviour. Jones therefore believed the truth of what he had said, as to his original and education; and at length, after much entreaty, he said, "Since you have heard, my friend, so much of my affairs, and seem so desirous to know the truth, if you will have patience to hear it, I will inform you of the whole."—"Patience!" cries Benjamin, "that I will, if the chapter was never so long; and I am very much obliged to you for the honour you do me."
Jones now began, and related the whole history, forgetting only a circumstance or two, namely, everything which passed on that day in which he had fought with Thwackum; and ended with his resolution to go to sea, till the rebellion in the North had made him change his purpose, and had brought him to the place where he then was.
368
Little Benjamin, who had been all attention, never once interrupted the narrative; but when it was ended he could not help observing, that there must be surely something more invented by his enemies, and told Mr Allworthy against him, or so good a man would never have dismissed one he had loved so tenderly, in such a manner. To which Jones answered, "He doubted not but such villanous arts had been made use of to destroy him."
And surely it was scarce possible for any one to have avoided making the same remark with the barber, who had not indeed heard from Jones one single circumstance upon which he was condemned; for his actions were not now placed in those injurious lights in which they had been misrepresented to Allworthy; nor could he mention those many false accusations which had been from time to time preferred against him to Allworthy: for with none of these he was himself acquainted. He had likewise, as we have observed, omitted many material facts in his present relation. Upon the whole, indeed, everything now appeared in such favourable colours to Jones, that malice itself would have found it no easy matter to fix any blame upon him.
Not that Jones desired to conceal or to disguise the truth; nay, he would have been more unwilling to have suffered any censure to fall on Mr Allworthy for punishing him, than on his own actions for deserving it; but, in reality, so it happened, and so it always will happen; for let a man be never so honest, the account of his own conduct will, in spite of himself, be so very favourable, that his vices will come purified through his lips, and, like foul liquors well strained, will leave all their foulness behind. For though the facts themselves may appear, yet so different will be the motives, circumstances, and consequences, when a man tells his own story, and when his enemy tells it, that we scarce can recognise the facts to be one and the same.
Though the barber had drank down this story with greedy ears, he was not yet satisfied. There was a circumstance behind which his curiosity, cold as it was, most eagerly longed for. Jones had mentioned the fact of his amour, and of his being the rival of Blifil, but had cautiously concealed the name of the young lady. The barber, therefore, after some hesitation, and many hums and hahs, at last begged leave to crave the name of the lady, who appeared to be the principal cause of all this mischief. Jones paused a moment, and then said, "Since I have trusted you with so much, and since, I am afraid, her name is become too publick already on this occasion, I will not conceal it from you. Her name is Sophia Western."
369
"Proh deum atque hominum fidem! Squire Western hath a daughter grown a woman!"一"Ay, and such a woman," cries Jones, "that the world cannot match. No eye ever saw anything so beautiful; but that is her least excellence. Such sense! such goodness! Oh, I could praise her for ever, and yet should omit half her virtues!"一"Mr Western a daughter grown up!" cries the barber: "I remember the father a boy; well, Tempus edax rerum."
The wine being now at an end, the barber pressed very eagerly to be his bottle; but Jones absolutely refused, saying, "He had already drank more than he ought: and that he now chose to retire to his room, where he wished he could procure himself a book."一"A book!" cries Benjamin; "what book would you have? Latin or English? I have some curious books in both languages; such as Erasmi Colloquia, Ovid de Tristibus, Gradus ad Parnassum; and in English I have several of the best books, though some of them are a little torn; but I have a great part of Stowe's Chronicle; the sixth volume of Pope's Homer; the third volume of the Spectator; the second volume of Echard's Roman History; the Craftsman; Robinson Crusoe; Thomas a Kempis; and two volumes of Tom Brown's Works."
"Those last," cries Jones, "are books I never saw, so if you please lend me one of those volumes." The barber assured him he would be highly entertained, for he looked upon the author to have been one of the greatest wits that ever the nation produced. He then stepped to his house, which was hard by, and immediately returned; after which, the barber having received very strict injunctions of secrecy from Jones, and having sworn inviolably to maintain it, they separated; the barber went home, and Jones retired to his chamber.

In which more of the talents of Mr Benjamin will appear, as well as who this extraordinary person was.
In the morning Jones grew a little uneasy at the desertion of his surgeon, as he apprehended some inconvenience, or even danger, might attend the not dressing his wound; he enquired of the drawer, what other surgeons were to be met with in that neighbourhood. The drawer told him, there was one not far off; but he had known him often refuse to be concerned after another had been sent before him; "but, sir," says he, "if you will take my advice, there is not a man in the kingdom can do your business better than the barber who was with you last night. We look upon him to be one of the ablest men at a cut in all this neighbourhood. For though he hath not been her above three months, he hath done several great cures."
The drawer was presently dispatched for Little Benjamin, who being acquainted in what capacity he was wanted, prepared himself accordingly, and attended; but with so different an air and aspect from that which he wore when his basin was under his arm, that he could scarce be known to be the same person.
"So, tonsor," says Jones, "I find you have more trades than one; how came you not to inform me of this last night?"一"A surgeon," answered Benjamin, with great gravity, "is a profession, not a trade. The reason why I did not acquaint you last night that I professed this art, was, that I then concluded you was under the hands of another gentleman, and I never love to interfere with my brethren in their business. Ars omnibus communis. But now, sir, if you please, I will inspect your head, and when I see into your skull, I will give my opinion of your case."
Jones had no great faith in this new professor; however, he suffered him to open the bandage and to look at his wound; which as soon as he had done, Benjamin began to groan and shake his head violently. Upon which Jones, in a peevish manner, bid him not play the fool, but tell him
371
in what condition he found him. "Shall I answer you as a surgeon, or a friend?" said Benjamin. "As a friend, and seriously," said Jones. "Why then, upon my soul," cries Benjamin, "it would require a great deal of art to keep you from being well after a very few dressings; and if you will suffer me to apply some salve of mine, I will answer for the success." Jones gave his consent, and the plaister was applied accordingly.
"There, sir," cries Benjamin: "now I will, if you please, resume my former self; but a man is obliged to keep up some dignity in his countenance whilst he is performing these operations, or the world will not submit to be handled by him. You can't imagine, sir, of how much consequence a grave aspect is to a grave character. A barber may make you laugh, but a surgeon ought rather to make you cry."
"Mr Barber, or Mr Surgeon, or Mr Barber-surgeon," said Jones. "O dear sir!" answered Benjamin, interrupting him, "Infandum, regina, jubes renov-are dolorem. You recall to my mind that cruel separation of the united fraternities, so much to the prejudice of both bodies, as all separations must be, according to the old adage, Vis unita fortior; which to be sure there are not wanting some of one or of the other fraternity who are able to construe. What a blow was this to me, who unite both in my own person!" "Well, by whatever name you please to be called," continued Jones, "you certainly are one of the oddest, most comical fellows I ever met with, and must have something very surprizing in your story, which you must confess I have a right to hear."一"I do confess it," answered Benjamin, "and will very readily acquaint you with it, when you have sufficient leisure, for I promise you it will require a good deal of time." Jones told him, he could never be more at leisure than at present. "Well, then," said Benjamin, "I will obey you; but first I will fasten the door, that none may interrupt us." He did so, and then advancing with a solemn air to Jones, said: "I must begin by telling you, sir, that you yourself have been the greatest enemy I ever had." Jones was a little startled at this sudden declaration. "I your enemy, sir!" says he, with much amazement, and some sternness in his look. "Nay, be not angry," said Benjamin, "for I promise you I am not. You are perfectly innocent of having intended me any wrong; for you was then an infant: but I shall, I believe, unriddle all this the moment I mention my name. Did you never hear, sir, of one Partridge, who had the honour of being reputed your father, and the misfortune of being ruined by that honour?" "I have, indeed, heard of that Partridge," says Jones, "and have always believed myself to be his son." "Well, sir," answered Benjamin, "I am that Partridge; but I here absolve you from all filial duty, for I do assure you, you are no son of mine."
372
"How!" replied Jones, "and is it possible that a false suspicion should have drawn all the ill consequences upon you, with which I am too well acquainted?" "It is possible," cries Benjamin, "for it is so: but though it is natural enough for men to hate even the innocent causes of their sufferings, yet I am of a different temper. I have loved you ever since I heard of your behaviour to Black George, as I told you; and I am convinced, from this extraordinary meeting, that you are born to make me amends for all I have suffered on that account. Besides, I dreamt, the night before I saw you, that I stumbled over a stool without hurting myself; which plainly showed me something good was towards me: and last night I dreamt again, that I rode behind you on a milk-white mare, which is a very excellent dream, and betokens much good fortune, which I am resolved to pursue unless you have the cruelty to deny me."
"I should be very glad, Mr Partridge," answered Jones, "to have it in my power to make you amends for your sufferings on my account, though at present I see no likelihood of it; however, I assure you I will deny you nothing which is in my power to grant."
"It is in your power sure enough," replied Benjamin; "for I desire nothing more than leave to attend you in this expedition. Nay, I have so entirely set my heart upon it, that if you should refuse me, you will kill both a barber and a surgeon in one breath."
Jones answered, smiling, that he should be very sorry to be the occasion of so much mischief to the public. He then advanced many prudential reasons, in order to dissuade Benjamin (whom we shall hereafter call Partridge) from his purpose; but all were in vain. Partridge relied strongly on his dream of the milk-white mare. "Besides, sir," says he, "I promise you I have as good an inclination to the cause as any man can possibly have; and go I will, whether you admit me to go in your company or not."
Jones, who was as much pleased with Partridge as Partridge could be with him, and who had not consulted his own inclination but the good of the other in desiring him to stay behind, when he found his friend so resolute, at last gave his consent; but then recollecting himself, he said, "Perhaps, Mr Partridge, you think I shall be able to support you, but I really am not;" and then taking out his purse, he told out nine guineas, which he declared were his whole fortune.
Partridge answered, "That his dependence was only on his future favour; for he was thoroughly convinced he would shortly have enough in his power. At present, sir," said he, "I believe I am rather the richer man
373
of the two; but all I have is at your service, and at your disposal. I insist upon your taking the whole, and I beg only to attend you in the quality of your servant; Nil desperandum est Teucro duce et auspice Teucro'': but to this generous proposal concerning the money, Jones would by no means submit.
It was resolved to set out the next morning, when a difficulty arose concerning the baggage; for the portmanteau of Mr Jones was too large to be carried without a horse.
"If I may presume to give my advice," says Partridge, "this portmanteau, with everything in it, except a few shirts, should be left behind. Those I shall be easily able to carry for you, and the rest of your cloaths will remain very safe locked up in my house."
This method was no sooner proposed than agreed to; and then the barber departed, in order to prepare everything for his intended expedition.

Chapter /
Containing better reasons than any which have yet appeared for the conduct of Partridge; an apology for the weakness of Jones; and some further anecdotes concerning my landlady.
Though Partridge was one of the most superstitious of men, he would hardly perhaps have desired to accompany Jones on his expedition merely from the omens of the joint-stool and white mare, if his prospect had been no better than to have shared the plunder gained in the field of battle. In fact, when Partridge came to ruminate on the relation he had heard from Jones, he could not reconcile to himself that Mr Allworthy should turn his son (for so he most firmly believed him to be) out of doors, for any reason which he had heard assigned. He concluded, therefore, that the whole was a fiction, and that Jones, of whom he had often from his correspondents heard the wildest character, had in reality run away from his father. It came into his head, therefore, that if he could prevail with the young gentleman to return back to his father, he should by that means render a service to Allworthy, which would obliterate all his former anger; nay, indeed, he conceived that very anger was counterfeited, and that Allworthy had sacrificed him to his own reputation. And this suspicion indeed he well accounted for, from the tender behaviour of that excellent man to the foundling child; from his great severity to Partridge, who, knowing himself to be innocent, could not conceive that any other should think him guilty; lastly, from the allowance which he had privately received long after the annuity had been publickly taken from him, and which he looked upon as a kind of smart-money, or rather by way of atonement for injustice; for it is very uncommon, I believe, for men to ascribe the benefactions they receive to pure charity, when they can possibly impute them to any other motive. If he could by any means therefore persuade the young gentleman to return home, he doubted not but that he should again be received into the favour of Allworthy, and well rewarded for his pains; nay, and should be again restored to his
375
native country; a restoration which Ulysses himself never wished more heartily than poor Partridge.
As for Jones, he was well satisfied with the truth of what the other had asserted, and believed that Partridge had no other inducements but love to him, and zeal for the cause; a blameable want of caution and diffidence in the veracity of others, in which he was highly worthy of censure. To say the truth, there are but two ways by which men become possessed of this excellent quality. The one is from long experience, and the other is from nature; which last, I presume, is often meant by genius, or great natural parts; and it is infinitely the better of the two, not only as we are masters of it much earlier in life, but as it is much more infallible and conclusive; for a man who hath been imposed on by ever so many, may still hope to find others more honest; whereas he who receives certain necessary admonitions from within, that this is impossible, must have very little understanding indeed, if he ever renders himself liable to be once deceived. As Jones had not this gift from nature, he was too young to have gained it by experience; for at the diffident wisdom which is to be acquired this way, we seldom arrive till very late in life; which is perhaps the reason why some old men are apt to despise the understandings of all those who are a little younger than themselves.
Jones spent most part of the day in the company of a new acquaintance. This was no other than the landlord of the house, or rather the husband of the landlady. He had but lately made his descent downstairs, after a long fit of the gout, in which distemper he was generally confined to his room during one half of the year; and during the rest, he walked about the house, smoaked his pipe, and drank his bottle with his friends, without concerning himself in the least with any kind of business. He had been bred, as they call it, a gentleman; that is, bred up to do nothing; and had spent a very small fortune, which he inherited from an industrious farmer his uncle, in hunting, horse-racing, and cock-fighting, and had been married by my landlady for certain purposes, which he had long since desisted from answering; for which she hated him heartily. But as he was a surly kind of fellow, so she contented herself with frequently upbraiding him by disadvantageous comparisons with her first husband, whose praise she had eternally in her mouth; and as she was for the most part mistress of the profit, so she was satisfied to take upon herself the care and government of the family, and, after a long successless struggle, to suffer her husband to be master of himself.
In the evening, when Jones retired to his room, a small dispute arose between this fond couple concerning him:一"What," says the wife, "you
376
have been tippling with the gentleman, I see?"一"Yes," answered the husband, "we have cracked a bottle together, and a very gentlemanlike man he is, and hath a very pretty notion of horse-flesh. Indeed, he is young, and hath not seen much of the world; for I believe he hath been at very few horse-races."一"Oho! he is one of your order, is he?" replies the landlady: "he must be a gentleman to be sure, if he is a horse-racer. The devil fetch such gentry! I am sure I wish I had never seen any of them. I have reason to love horse-racers truly!"一"That you have," says the husband; "for I was one, you know."一"Yes," answered she, "you are a pure one indeed. As my first husband used to say, I may put all the good I have ever got by you in my eyes, and see never the worse."一"D一n your first husband!" cries he. "Don't d一n a better man than yourself," answered the wife: "if he had been alive, you durst not have done it."一"Then you think," says he, "I have not so much courage as yourself; for you have d一n'd him often in my hearing."一"If I did," says she, "I have repented of it many's the good time and oft. And if he was so good to forgive me a word spoken in haste or so, it doth not become such a one as you to twitter me. He was a husband to me, he was; and if ever I did make use of an ill word or so in a passion, I never called him rascal; I should have told a lie, if I had called him rascal." Much more she said, but not in his hearing; for having lighted his pipe, he staggered off as fast as he could. We shall therefore transcribe no more of her speech, as it approached still nearer and nearer to a subject too indelicate to find any place in this history.
Early in the morning Partridge appeared at the bedside of Jones, ready equipped for the journey, with his knapsack at his back. This was his own workmanship; for besides his other trades, he was no indifferent taylor. He had already put up his whole stock of linen in it, consisting of four shirts, to which he now added eight for Mr Jones; and then packing up the portmanteau, he was departing with it towards his own house, but was stopt in his way by the landlady, who refused to suffer any removals till after the payment of the reckoning.
The landlady was, as we have said, absolute governess in these regions; it was therefore necessary to comply with her rules; so the bill was presently writ out, which amounted to a much larger sum than might have been expected, from the entertainment which Jones had met with. But here we are obliged to disclose some maxims, which publicans hold to be the grand mysteries of their trade. The first is, If they have anything good in their house (which indeed very seldom happens) to produce it only to persons who travel with great equipages. 2dly, To charge the
377
same for the very worst provisions, as if they were the best. And lastly, If any of their guests call but for little, to make them pay a double price for everything they have; so that the amount by the head may be much the same.
The bill being made and discharged, Jones set forward with Partridge, carrying his knapsack; nor did the landlady condescend to wish him a good journey; for this was, it seems, an inn frequented by people of fashion; and I know not whence it is, but all those who get their livelihood by people of fashion, contract as much insolence to the rest of mankind, as if they really belonged to that rank themselves.

Chapter V?
Jones arrives at Gloucester, and goes to the Bell; the character of that house, and of a petty-fogger which he there meets with.
Mr Jones and Partridge, or Little Benjamin (which epithet of Little was perhaps given him ironically, he being in reality near six feet high), having left their last quarters in the manner before described, travelled on to Gloucester without meeting any adventure worth relating.
Being arrived here, they chose for their house of entertainment the sign of the Bell, an excellent house indeed, and which I do most seriously recommend to every reader who shall visit this antient city. The master of it is brother to the great preacher Whitefield; but is absolutely untainted with the pernicious principles of Methodism, or of any other heretical sect. He is indeed a very honest plain man, and, in my opinion, not likely to create any disturbance either in church or state. His wife hath, I believe, had much pretension to beauty, and is still a very fine woman. Her person and deportment might have made a shining figure in the politest assemblies; but though she must be conscious of this and many other perfections, she seems perfectly contented with, and resigned to, that state of life to which she is called; and this resignation is entirely owing to the prudence and wisdom of her temper; for she is at present as free from any Methodistical notions as her husband: I say at present; for she freely confesses that her brother's documents made at first some impression upon her, and that she had put herself to the expense of a long hood, in order to attend the extraordinary emotions of the Spirit; but having found, during an experiment of three weeks, no emotions, she says, worth a farthing, she very wisely laid by her hood, and abandoned the sect. To be concise, she is a very friendly good-natured woman; and so industrious to oblige, that the guests must be of a very morose disposition who are not extremely well satisfied in her house.
Mrs Whitefield happened to be in the yard when Jones and his attendant marched in. Her sagacity soon discovered in the air of our heroe something which distinguished him from the vulgar. She ordered her
379
servants, therefore, immediately to show him into a room, and presently afterwards invited him to dinner with herself; which invitation he very thankfully accepted; for indeed much less agreeable company than that of Mrs Whitefield, and a much worse entertainment than she had provided, would have been welcome after so long fasting and so long a walk.
Besides Mr Jones and the good governess of the mansion, there sat down at table an attorney of Salisbury, indeed the very same who had brought the news of Mrs Blifil's death to Mr Allworthy, and whose name, which I think we did not before mention, was Dowling: there was likewise present another person, who stiled himself a lawyer, and who lived somewhere near Linlinch, in Somersetshire. This fellow, I say, stiled himself a lawyer, but was indeed a most vile petty-fogger, without sense or knowledge of any kind; one of those who may be termed trainbearers to the law; a sort of supernumeraries in the profession, who are the hackneys of attorneys, and will ride more miles for half-a-crown than a postboy.
During the time of dinner, the Somersetshire lawyer recollected the face of Jones, which he had seen at Mr Allworthy's; for he had often visited in that gentleman's kitchen. He therefore took occasion to enquire after the good family there with that familiarity which would have become an intimate friend or acquaintance of Mr Allworthy; and indeed he did all in his power to insinuate himself to be such, though he had never had the honour of speaking to any person in that family higher than the butler. Jones answered all his questions with much civility, though he never remembered to have seen the petty-fogger before; and though he concluded, from the outward appearance and behaviour of the man, that he usurped a freedom with his betters, to which he was by no means intitled.
As the conversation of fellows of this kind is of all others the most detestable to men of any sense, the cloth was no sooner removed than Mr Jones withdrew, and a little barbarously left poor Mrs Whitefield to do a penance, which I have often heard Mr Timothy Harris, and other publicans of good taste, lament, as the severest lot annexed to their calling, namely, that of being obliged to keep company with their guests.
Jones had no sooner quitted the room, than the petty-fogger, in a whispering tone, asked Mrs Whitefield, "If she knew who that fine spark was?" She answered, "She had never seen the gentleman before."一"The gentleman, indeed!" replied the petty-fogger; "a pretty gentleman, truly!
380
Why, he's the bastard of a fellow who was hanged for horse-stealing. He was dropt at Squire Allworthy's door, where one of the servants found him in a box so full of rain-water, that he would certainly have been drowned, had he not been reserved for another fate."一"Ay, ay, you need not mention it, I protest: we understand what that fate is very well," cries Dowling, with a most facetious grin.—"Well," continued the other, "the squire ordered him to be taken in; for he is a timbersome man everybody knows, and was afraid of drawing himself into a scrape; and there the bastard was bred up, and fed, and cloathified all to the world like any gentleman; and there he got one of the servant-maids with child, and persuaded her to swear it to the squire himself; and afterwards he broke the arm of one Mr Thwackum a clergyman, only because he reprimanded him for following whores; and afterwards he snapt a pistol at Mr Blifil behind his back; and once, when Squire Allworthy was sick, he got a drum, and beat it all over the house to prevent him from sleeping; and twenty other pranks he hath played, for all which, about four or five days ago, just before I left the country, the squire stripped him stark naked, and turned him out of doors."
"And very justly too, I protest," cries Dowling; "I would turn my own son out of doors, if he was guilty of half as much. And pray what is the name of this pretty gentleman?"
"The name o' un?" answered Petty-fogger; "why, he is called Thomas Jones."
"Jones!" answered Dowling a little eagerly; "what, Mr Jones that lived at Mr Allworthy's? was that the gentleman that dined with us?"一"The very same," said the other. "I have heard of the gentleman," cries Dowling, "often; but I never heard any ill character of him."一"And I am sure," says Mrs Whitefield, "if half what this gentleman hath said be true, Mr Jones hath the most deceitful countenance I ever saw; for sure his looks promise something very different; and I must say, for the little I have seen of him, he is as civil a well-bred man as you would wish to converse with."
Petty-fogger calling to mind that he had not been sworn, as he usually was, before he gave his evidence, now bound what he had declared with so many oaths and imprecations that the landlady's ears were shocked, and she put a stop to his swearing, by assuring him of her belief. Upon which he said, "I hope, madam, you imagine I would scorn to tell such things of any man, unless I knew them to be true. What interest have I in taking away the reputation of a man who never injured me? I promise
381
you every syllable of what I have said is fact, and the whole country knows it."
As Mrs Whitefield had no reason to suspect that the petty-fogger had any motive or temptation to abuse Jones, the reader cannot blame her for believing what he so confidently affirmed with many oaths. She accordingly gave up her skill in physiognomy, and hence-forwards conceived so ill an opinion of her guest, that she heartily wished him out of her house.
This dislike was now farther increased by a report which Mr Whitefield made from the kitchen, where Partridge had informed the company, "That though he carried the knapsack, and contented himself with staying among servants, while Tom Jones (as he called him) was regaling in the parlour, he was not his servant, but only a friend and companion, and as good a gentleman as Mr Jones himself."
Dowling sat all this while silent, biting his fingers, making faces, grinning, and looking wonderfully arch; at last he opened his lips, and protested that the gentleman looked like another sort of man. He then called for his bill with the utmost haste, declared he must be at Hereford that evening, lamented his great hurry of business, and wished he could divide himself into twenty pieces, in order to be at once in twenty places.
The petty-fogger now likewise departed, and then Jones desired the favour of Mrs Whitefield's company to drink tea with him; but she refused, and with a manner so different from that with which she had received him at dinner, that it a little surprized him. And now he soon perceived her behaviour totally changed; for instead of that natural affability which we have before celebrated, she wore a constrained severity on her countenance, which was so disagreeable to Mr Jones, that he resolved, however late, to quit the house that evening.
He did indeed account somewhat unfairly for this sudden change; for besides some hard and unjust surmises concerning female fickleness and mutability, he began to suspect that he owed this want of civility to his want of horses; a sort of animals which, as they dirty no sheets, are thought in inns to pay better for their beds than their riders, and are therefore considered as the more desirable company; but Mrs Whitefield, to do her justice, had a much more liberal way of thinking. She was perfectly well-bred, and could be very civil to a gentleman, though he walked on foot. In reality, she looked on our heroe as a sorry scoundrel, and therefore treated him as such, for which not even Jones himself, had he known as much as the reader, could have blamed her; nay, on the
382
contrary, he must have approved her conduct, and have esteemed her the more for the disrespect shown towards himself. This is indeed a most aggravating circumstance, which attends depriving men unjustly of their reputation; for a man who is conscious of having an ill character, cannot justly be angry with those who neglect and slight him; but ought rather to despise such as affect his conversation, unless where a perfect intimacy must have convinced them that their friend's character hath been falsely and injuriously aspersed.
This was not, however, the case of Jones; for as he was a perfect stranger to the truth, so he was with good reason offended at the treatment he received. He therefore paid his reckoning and departed, highly against the will of Mr Partridge, who having remonstrated much against it to no purpose, at last condescended to take up his knapsack and to attend his friend.

Chapter J
Containing several dialogues between Jones and Partridge, concerning love, cold, hunger, and other matters; with the lucky and narrow escape of Partridge, as he was on the very brink of making a fatal discovery to his friend.
The shadows began now to descend larger from the high mountains; the feathered creation had betaken themselves to their rest. Now the highest order of mortals were sitting down to their dinners, and the lowest order to their suppers. In a word, the clock struck five just as Mr Jones took his leave of Gloucester; an hour at which (as it was now midwinter) the dirty fingers of Night would have drawn her sable curtain over the universe, had not the moon forbid her, who now, with a face as broad and as red as those of some jolly mortals, who, like her, turn night into day, began to rise from her bed, where she had slumbered away the day, in order to sit up all night. Jones had not travelled far before he paid his compliments to that beautiful planet, and, turning to his companion, asked him if he had ever beheld so delicious an evening? Partridge making no ready answer to his question, he proceeded to comment on the beauty of the moon, and repeated some passages from Milton, who hath certainly excelled all other poets in his description of the heavenly luminaries. He then told Partridge the story from the Spectator, of two lovers who had agreed to entertain themselves when they were at a great distance from each other, by repairing, at a certain fixed hour, to look at the moon; thus pleasing themselves with the thought that they were both employed in contemplating the same object at the same time. "Those lovers," added he, "must have had souls truly capable of feeling all the tenderness of the sublimest of all human passions."一"Very probably," cries Partridge: "but I envy them more, if they had bodies incapable of feeling cold; for I am almost frozen to death, and am very much afraid I shall lose a piece of my nose before we get to another house of entertainment. Nay, truly, we may well expect some judgment should happen to us for our folly in running away so by night from one of the most excellent inns
384
I ever set my foot into. I am sure I never saw more good things in my life, and the greatest lord in the land cannot live better in his own house than he may there. And to forsake such a house, and go a rambling about the country, the Lord knows whither, per devia rura viarum, I say nothing for my part; but some people might not have charity enough to conclude we were in our sober senses."一"Fie upon it, Mr Partridge!" says Jones, "have a better heart; consider you are going to face an enemy; and are you afraid of facing a little cold? I wish, indeed, we had a guide to advise which of these roads we should take."一"May I be so bold," says Partridge, "to offer my advice? Interdum stultus opportuna loquitur''一"Why, which of them," cries Jones, "would you recommend?"一"Truly neither of them," answered Partridge. "The only road we can be certain of finding, is the road we came. A good hearty pace will bring us back to Gloucester in an hour; but if we go forward, the Lord Harry knows when we shall arrive at any place; for I see at least fifty miles before me, and no house in all the way."一"You see, indeed, a very fair prospect," says Jones, "which receives great additional beauty from the extreme lustre of the moon. However, I will keep the left-hand track, as that seems to lead directly to those hills, which we were informed lie not far from Worcester. And here, if you are inclined to quit me, you may, and return back again; but for my part, I am resolved to go forward."
"It is unkind in you, sir," says Partridge, "to suspect me of any such intention. What I have advised hath been as much on your account as on my own: but since you are determined to go on, I am as much determined to follow. I prae sequar te."
They now travelled some miles without speaking to each other, during which suspense of discourse Jones often sighed, and Benjamin groaned as bitterly, though from a very different reason. At length Jones made a full stop, and turning about, cries, "Who knows, Partridge, but the loveliest creature in the universe may have her eyes now fixed on that very moon which I behold at this instant?" "Very likely, sir," answered Partridge; "and if my eyes were fixed on a good surloin of roast beef, the devil might take the moon and her horns into the bargain." "Did ever Tramontane make such an answer?" cries Jones. "Prithee, Partridge, wast thou ever susceptible of love in thy life, or hath time worn away all the traces of it from thy memory?" "Alack-a-day!" cries Partridge, "well would it have been for me if I had never known what love was. Infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem. I am sure I have tasted all the tenderness, and sublimities, and bitternesses of the passion." "Was your mistress unkind, then?" says Jones. "Very unkind, indeed, sir," answered Partridge;
385
"for she married me, and made one of the most confounded wives in the world. However, heaven be praised, she's gone; and if I believed she was in the moon, according to a book I once read, which teaches that to be the receptacle of departed spirits, I would never look at it for fear of seeing her; but I wish, sir, that the moon was a looking-glass for your sake, and that Miss Sophia Western was now placed before it." "My dear Partridge," cries Jones, "what a thought was there! A thought which I am certain could never have entered into any mind but that of a lover. O Partridge! could I hope once again to see that face; but, alas! all those golden dreams are vanished for ever, and my only refuge from future misery is to forget the object of all my former happiness." "And do you really despair of ever seeing Miss Western again?" answered Partridge; "if you will follow my advice I will engage you shall not only see her but have her in your arms." "Ha! do not awaken a thought of that nature," cries Jones: "I have struggled sufficiently to conquer all such wishes already." "Nay," answered Partridge, "if you do not wish to have your mistress in your arms you are a most extraordinary lover indeed." "Well, well," says Jones, "let us avoid this subject; but pray what is your advice?" "To give it you in the military phrase, then," says Partridge, "as we are soldiers, 'To the right about.' Let us return the way we came; we may yet reach Gloucester to-night, though late; whereas, if we proceed, we are likely, for aught I see, to ramble about for ever without coming either to house or home." "I have already told you my resolution is to go on," answered Jones; "but I would have you go back. I am obliged to you for your company hither; and I beg you to accept a guinea as a small instance of my gratitude. Nay, it would be cruel in me to suffer you to go any farther; for, to deal plainly with you, my chief end and desire is a glorious death in the service of my king and country." "As for your money," replied Partridge, "I beg, sir, you will put it up; I will receive none of you at this time; for at present I am, I believe, the richer man of the two. And as your resolution is to go on, so mine is to follow you if you do. Nay, now my presence appears absolutely necessary to take care of you, since your intentions are so desperate; for I promise you my views are much more prudent; as you are resolved to fall in battle if you can, so I am resolved as firmly to come to no hurt if I can help it. And, indeed, I have the comfort to think there will be but little danger; for a popish priest told me the other day the business would soon be over, and he believed without a battle." "A popish priest!" cries Jones, "I have heard is not always to be believed when he speaks in behalf of his religion." "Yes, but so far," answered the other, "from speaking in behalf of his religion, he assured
386
me the Catholicks did not expect to be any gainers by the change; for that Prince Charles was as good a Protestant as any in England; and that nothing but regard to right made him and the rest of the popish party to be Jacobites."一"I believe him to be as much a Protestant as I believe he hath any right," says Jones; "and I make no doubt of our success, but not without a battle. So that I am not so sanguine as your friend the popish priest." "Nay, to be sure, sir," answered Partridge, "all the prophecies I have ever read speak of a great deal of blood to be spilt in the quarrel, and the miller with three thumbs, who is now alive, is to hold the horses of three kings, up to his knees in blood. Lord, have mercy upon us all, and send better times!" "With what stuff and nonsense hast thou filled thy head!" answered Jones: "this too, I suppose, comes from the popish priest. Monsters and prodigies are the proper arguments to support monstrous and absurd doctrines. The cause of King George is the cause of liberty and true religion. In other words, it is the cause of common sense, my boy, and I warrant you will succeed, though Briarius himself was to rise again with his hundred thumbs, and to turn miller." Partridge made no reply to this. He was, indeed, cast into the utmost confusion by this declaration of Jones. For, to inform the reader of a secret, which he had no proper opportunity of revealing before, Partridge was in truth a Jacobite, and had concluded that Jones was of the same party, and was now proceeding to join the rebels. An opinion which was not without foundation. For the tall, long-sided dame, mentioned by Hudibras一that many-eyed, many-tongued, many-mouthed, many-eared monster of Virgil, had related the story of the quarrel between Jones and the officer, with the usual regard to truth. She had, indeed, changed the name of Sophia into that of the Pretender, and had reported, that drinking his health was the cause for which Jones was knocked down. This Partridge had heard, and most firmly believed. 'Tis no wonder, therefore, that he had thence entertained the above-mentioned opinion of Jones; and which he had almost discovered to him before he found out his own mistake. And at this the reader will be the less inclined to wonder, if he pleases to recollect the doubtful phrase in which Jones first communicated his resolution to Mr Partridge; and, indeed, had the words been less ambiguous, Partridge might very well have construed them as he did; being persuaded as he was that the whole nation were of the same inclination in their hearts; nor did it stagger him that Jones had travelled in the company of soldiers; for he had the same opinion of the army which he had of the rest of the people.
387
But however well affected he might be to James or Charles, he was still much more attached to Little Benjamin than to either; for which reason he no sooner discovered the principles of his fellow-traveller than he thought proper to conceal and outwardly give up his own to the man on whom he depended for the making his fortune, since he by no means believed the affairs of Jones to be so desperate as they really were with Mr Allworthy; for as he had kept a constant correspondence with some of his neighbours since he left that country, he had heard much, indeed more than was true, of the great affection Mr Allworthy bore this young man, who, as Partridge had been instructed, was to be that gentleman's heir, and whom, as we have said, he did not in the least doubt to be his son.
He imagined therefore that whatever quarrel was between them, it would be certainly made up at the return of Mr Jones; an event from which he promised great advantages, if he could take this opportunity of ingratiating himself with that young gentleman; and if he could by any means be instrumental in procuring his return, he doubted not, as we have before said, but it would as highly advance him in the favour of Mr Allworthy.
We have already observed, that he was a very good-natured fellow, and he hath himself declared the violent attachment he had to the person and character of Jones; but possibly the views which I have just before mentioned, might likewise have some little share in prompting him to undertake this expedition, at least in urging him to continue it, after he had discovered that his master and himself, like some prudent fathers and sons, though they travelled together in great friendship, had embraced opposite parties. I am led into this conjecture, by having remarked, that though love, friendship, esteem, and such like, have very powerful operations in the human mind; interest, however, is an ingredient seldom omitted by wise men, when they would work others to their own purposes. This is indeed a most excellent medicine, and, like Ward's pill, flies at once to the particular part of the body on which you desire to operate, whether it be the tongue, the hand, or any other member, where it scarce ever fails of immediately producing the desired effect.

Chapter A Vx
In which our travellers meet with a very extraordinary adventure.
Just as Jones and his friend came to the end of their dialogue in the preceding chapter, they arrived at the bottom of a very steep hill. Here Jones stopt short, and directing his eyes upwards, stood for a while silent. At length he called to his companion, and said, "Partridge, I wish I was at the top of this hill; it must certainly afford a most charming prospect, especially by this light; for the solemn gloom which the moon casts on all objects, is beyond expression beautiful, especially to an imagination which is desirous of cultivating melancholy ideas."一"Very probably," answered Partridge; "but if the top of the hill be properest to produce melancholy thoughts, I suppose the bottom is the likeliest to produce merry ones, and these I take to be much the better of the two. I protest you have made my blood run cold with the very mentioning the top of that mountain; which seems to me to be one of the highest in the world. No, no, if we look for anything, let it be for a place under ground, to screen ourselves from the frost."一"Do so," said Jones; "let it be but within hearing of this place, and I will hallow to you at my return back."一"Surely, sir, you are not mad," said Partridge.一"Indeed, I am," answered Jones, "if ascending this hill be madness; but as you complain so much of the cold already, I would have you stay below. I will certainly return to you within an hour."一"Pardon me, sir," cries Partridge; "I have determined to follow you wherever you go." Indeed he was now afraid to stay behind; for though he was coward enough in all respects, yet his chief fear was that of ghosts, with which the present time of night, and the wildness of the place, extremely well suited.
At this instant Partridge espied a glimmering light through some trees, which seemed very near to them. He immediately cried out in a rapture, "Oh, sir! Heaven hath at last heard my prayers, and hath brought us to a house; perhaps it may be an inn. Let me beseech you, sir, if you have any compassion either for me or yourself, do not despise the goodness of Providence, but let us go directly to yon light. Whether it be a public
389
house or no, I am sure if they be Christians that dwell there, they will not refuse a little house-room to persons in our miserable condition." Jones at length yielded to the earnest supplications of Partridge, and both together made directly towards the place whence the light issued.
They soon arrived at the door of this house, or cottage, for it might be called either, without much impropriety. Here Jones knocked several times without receiving any answer from within; at which Partridge, whose head was full of nothing but of ghosts, devils, witches, and such like, began to tremble, crying, "Lord, have mercy upon us! surely the people must be all dead. I can see no light neither now, and yet I am certain I saw a candle burning but a moment before.一Well! I have heard of such things."一"What hast thou heard of?" said Jones. "The people are either fast asleep, or probably, as this is a lonely place, are afraid to open their door." He then began to vociferate pretty loudly, and at last an old woman, opening an upper casement, asked, Who they were, and what they wanted? Jones answered, They were travellers who had lost their way, and having seen a light in the window, had been led thither in hopes of finding some fire to warm themselves. "Whoever you are," cries the woman, "you have no business here; nor shall I open the door to any one at this time of night." Partridge, whom the sound of a human voice had recovered from his fright, fell to the most earnest supplications to be admitted for a few minutes to the fire, saying, he was almost dead with the cold; to which fear had indeed contributed equally with the frost. He assured her that the gentleman who spoke to her was one of the greatest squires in the country; and made use of every argument, save one, which Jones afterwards effectually added; and this was, the promise of half-a-crown;一a bribe too great to be resisted by such a person, especially as the genteel appearance of Jones, which the light of the moon plainly discovered to her, together with his affable behaviour, had entirely subdued those apprehensions of thieves which she had at first conceived. She agreed, therefore, at last, to let them in; where Partridge, to his infinite joy, found a good fire ready for his reception.
The poor fellow, however, had no sooner warmed himself, than those thoughts which were always uppermost in his mind, began a little to disturb his brain. There was no article of his creed in which he had a stronger faith than he had in witchcraft, nor can the reader conceive a figure more adapted to inspire this idea, than the old woman who now stood before him. She answered exactly to that picture drawn by Otway in his Orphan. Indeed, if this woman had lived in the reign of James the
390
First, her appearance alone would have hanged her, almost without any evidence.
Many circumstances likewise conspired to confirm Partridge in his opinion. Her living, as he then imagined, by herself in so lonely a place; and in a house, the outside of which seemed much too good for her, but its inside was furnished in the most neat and elegant manner. To say the truth, Jones himself was not a little surprized at what he saw; for, besides the extraordinary neatness of the room, it was adorned with a great number of nicknacks and curiosities, which might have engaged the attention of a virtuoso.
While Jones was admiring these things, and Partridge sat trembling with the firm belief that he was in the house of a witch, the old woman said, "I hope, gentlemen, you will make what haste you can; for I expect my master presently, and I would not for double the money he should find you here."一"Then you have a master?" cried Jones. "Indeed, you will excuse me, good woman, but I was surprized to see all those fine things in your house."一"Ah, sir," said she, "if the twentieth part of these things were mine, I should think myself a rich woman. But pray, sir, do not stay much longer, for I look for him in every minute."一"Why, sure he would not be angry with you," said Jones, "for doing a common act of charity?"一"Alack-a-day, sir!" said she, "he is a strange man, not at all like other people. He keeps no company with anybody, and seldom walks out but by night, for he doth not care to be seen; and all the country people are as much afraid of meeting him; for his dress is enough to frighten those who are not used to it. They call him, the Man of the Hill (for there he walks by night), and the country people are not, I believe, more afraid of the devil himself. He would be terribly angry if he found you here."一"Pray, sir," says Partridge, "don't let us offend the gentleman; I am ready to walk, and was never warmer in my life. Do pray, sir, let us go. Here are pistols over the chimney: who knows whether they be charged or no, or what he may do with them?"一"Fear nothing, Partridge," cries Jones; "I will secure thee from danger."一"Nay, for matter o' that, he never doth any mischief," said the woman; "but to be sure it is necessary he should keep some arms for his own safety; for his house hath been beset more than once; and it is not many nights ago that we thought we heard thieves about it: for my own part, I have often wondered that he is not murdered by some villain or other, as he walks out by himself at such hours; but then, as I said, the people are afraid of him; and besides, they think, I suppose, he hath nothing about him worth taking."一"I should imagine, by this collection of rarities," cries
391
Jones, "that your master had been a traveller."一"Yes, sir," answered she, "he hath been a very great one: there be few gentlemen that know more of all matters than he. I fancy he hath been crost in love, or whatever it is I know not; but I have lived with him above these thirty years, and in all that time he hath hardly spoke to six living people." She then again solicited their departure, in which she was backed by Partridge; but Jones purposely protracted the time, for his curiosity was greatly raised to see this extraordinary person. Though the old woman, therefore, concluded every one of her answers with desiring him to be gone, and Partridge proceeded so far as to pull him by the sleeve, he still continued to invent new questions, till the old woman, with an affrighted countenance, declared she heard her master's signal; and at the same instant more than one voice was heard without the door, crying, "D一n your blood, show us your money this instant. Your money, you villain, or we will blow your brains about your ears."
"O, good heaven!" cries the old woman, "some villains, to be sure, have attacked my master. O la! what shall I do? what shall I do?"一"How!" cries Jones, "how!—Are these pistols loaded?"—"O, good sir, there is nothing in them, indeed. O pray don't murder us, gentlemen!" (for in reality she now had the same opinion of those within as she had of those without). Jones made her no answer; but snatching an old broad sword which hung in the room, he instantly sallied out, where he found the old gentleman struggling with two ruffians, and begging for mercy. Jones asked no questions, but fell so briskly to work with his broad sword, that the fellows immediately quitted their hold; and without offering to attack our heroe, betook themselves to their heels and made their escape; for he did not attempt to pursue them, being contented with having delivered the old gentleman; and indeed he concluded he had pretty well done their business, for both of them, as they ran off, cried out with bitter oaths that they were dead men.
Jones presently ran to lift up the old gentleman, who had been thrown down in the scuffle, expressing at the same time great concern lest he should have received any harm from the villains. The old man stared a moment at Jones, and then cried, "No, sir, no, I have very little harm, I thank you. Lord have mercy upon me!"一"I see, sir," said Jones, "you are not free from apprehensions even of those who have had the happiness to be your deliverers; nor can I blame any suspicions which you may have; but indeed you have no real occasion for any; here are none but your friends present. Having mist our way this cold night, we took the liberty of warming ourselves at your fire, whence we were just departing
392
when we heard you call for assistance, which, I must say, Providence alone seems to have sent you."一"Providence, indeed," cries the old gentleman, "if it be so."一"So it is, I assure you," cries Jones. "Here is your own sword, sir; I have used it in your defence, and I now return it into your hand." The old man having received the sword, which was stained with the blood of his enemies, looked stedfastly at Jones during some moments, and then with a sigh cried out, "You will pardon me, young gentleman; I was not always of a suspicious temper, nor am I a friend to ingratitude."
"Be thankful then," cries Jones, "to that Providence to which you owe your deliverance: as to my part, I have only discharged the common duties of humanity, and what I would have done for any fellow-creature in your situation."一"Let me look at you a little longer," cries the old gentleman. "You are a human creature then? Well, perhaps you are. Come pray walk into my little hutt. You have been my deliverer indeed."
The old woman was distracted between the fears which she had of her master, and for him; and Partridge was, if possible, in a greater fright. The former of these, however, when she heard her master speak kindly to Jones, and perceived what had happened, came again to herself; but Partridge no sooner saw the gentleman, than the strangeness of his dress infused greater terrors into that poor fellow than he had before felt, either from the strange description which he had heard, or from the uproar which had happened at the door.
To say the truth, it was an appearance which might have affected a more constant mind than that of Mr Partridge. This person was of the tallest size, with a long beard as white as snow. His body was cloathed with the skin of an ass, made something into the form of a coat. He wore likewise boots on his legs, and a cap on his head, both composed of the skin of some other animals.
As soon as the old gentleman came into his house, the old woman began her congratulations on his happy escape from the ruffians. "Yes," cried he, "I have escaped, indeed, thanks to my preserver."一"O the blessing on him!" answered she: "he is a good gentleman, I warrant him. I was afraid your worship would have been angry with me for letting him in; and to be certain I should not have done it, had not I seen by the moonlight, that he was a gentleman, and almost frozen to death. And to be certain it must have been some good angel that sent him hither, and tempted me to do it."
393
"I am afraid, sir," said the old gentleman to Jones, "that I have nothing in this house which you can either eat or drink, unless you will accept a dram of brandy; of which I can give you some most excellent, and which I have had by me these thirty years." Jones declined this offer in a very civil and proper speech, and then the other asked him, "Whither he was travelling when he mist his way?" saying, "I must own myself surprized to see such a person as you appear to be, journeying on foot at this time of night. I suppose, sir, you are a gentleman of these parts; for you do not look like one who is used to travel far without horses?"
"Appearances," cried Jones, "are often deceitful; men sometimes look what they are not. I assure you I am not of this country; and whither I am travelling, in reality I scarce know myself."
"Whoever you are, or whithersoever you are going," answered the old man, "I have obligations to you which I can never return."
"I once more," replied Jones, "affirm that you have none; for there can be no merit in having hazarded that in your service on which I set no value; and nothing is so contemptible in my eyes as life."
"I am sorry, young gentleman," answered the stranger, "that you have any reason to be so unhappy at your years."
"Indeed I am, sir," answered Jones, "the most unhappy of man-kind."一"Perhaps you have had a friend, or a mistress?" replied the other. "How could you," cries Jones, "mention two words sufficient to drive me to distraction?"一"Either of them are enough to drive any man to distraction," answered the old man. "I enquire no farther, sir; perhaps my curiosity hath led me too far already."
"Indeed, sir," cries Jones, "I cannot censure a passion which I feel at this instant in the highest degree. You will pardon me when I assure you, that everything which I have seen or heard since I first entered this house hath conspired to raise the greatest curiosity in me. Something very extraordinary must have determined you to this course of life, and I have reason to fear your own history is not without misfortunes."
Here the old gentleman again sighed, and remained silent for some minutes: at last, looking earnestly on Jones, he said, "I have read that a good countenance is a letter of recommendation; if so, none ever can be more strongly recommended than yourself. If I did not feel some yearnings towards you from another consideration, I must be the most ungrateful monster upon earth; and I am really concerned it is no otherwise in my power than by words to convince you of my gratitude."
394
Jones, after a moment's hesitation, answered, "That it was in his power by words to gratify him extremely. I have confest a curiosity," said he, "sir; need I say how much obliged I should be to you, if you would condescend to gratify it? Will you suffer me therefore to beg, unless any consideration restrains you, that you would be pleased to acquaint me what motives have induced you thus to withdraw from the society of mankind, and to betake yourself to a course of life to which it sufficiently appears you were not born?"
"I scarce think myself at liberty to refuse you anything after what hath happened," replied the old man. "If you desire therefore to hear the story of an unhappy man, I will relate it to you. Indeed you judge rightly, in thinking there is commonly something extraordinary in the fortunes of those who fly from society; for however it may seem a paradox, or even a contradiction, certain it is, that great philanthropy chiefly inclines us to avoid and detest mankind; not on account so much of their private and selfish vices, but for those of a relative kind; such as envy, malice, treachery, cruelty, with every other species of malevolence. These are the vices which true philanthropy abhors, and which rather than see and converse with, she avoids society itself. However, without a compliment to you, you do not appear to me one of those whom I should shun or detest; nay, I must say, in what little hath dropt from you, there appears some parity in our fortunes: I hope, however, yours will conclude more successfully."
Here some compliments passed between our heroe and his host, and then the latter was going to begin his history, when Partridge interrupted him. His apprehensions had now pretty well left him, but some effects of his terrors remained; he therefore reminded the gentleman of that excellent brandy which he had mentioned. This was presently brought, and Partridge swallowed a large bumper.
The gentleman then, without any farther preface, began as you may read in the next chapter.
395
In which the Man of the Hill begins to relate his history.
"I was born in a village of Somersetshire, called Mark, in the year 1657. My father was one of those whom they call gentlemen farmers. He had a little estate of about £300 a year of his own, and rented another estate of near the same value. He was prudent and industrious, and so good a husbandman, that he might have led a very easy and comfortable life, had not an arrant vixen of a wife soured his domestic quiet. But though this circumstance perhaps made him miserable, it did not make him poor; for he confined her almost entirely at home, and rather chose to bear eternal upbraidings in his own house, than to injure his fortune by indulging her in the extravagancies she desired abroad.
"By this Xanthippe" (so was the wife of Socrates called, said Part-ridge)一"by this Xanthippe he had two sons, of which I was the younger. He designed to give us both good education; but my elder brother, who, unhappily for him, was the favourite of my mother, utterly neglected his learning; insomuch that, after having been five or six years at school with little or no improvement, my father, being told by his master that it would be to no purpose to keep him longer there, at last complied with my mother in taking him home from the hands of that tyrant, as she called his master; though indeed he gave the lad much less correction than his idleness deserved, but much more, it seems, than the young gentleman liked, who constantly complained to his mother of his severe treatment, and she as constantly gave him a hearing."
"Yes, yes," cries Partridge, "I have seen such mothers; I have been abused myself by them, and very unjustly; such parents deserve correction as much as their children."
Jones chid the pedagogue for his interruption, and then the stranger proceeded.
"My brother now, at the age of fifteen, bade adieu to all learning, and to everything else but to his dog and gun; with which latter he became so
396
expert, that, though perhaps you may think it incredible, he could not only hit a standing mark with great certainty, but hath actually shot a crow as it was flying in the air. He was likewise excellent at finding a hare sitting, and was soon reputed one of the best sportsmen in the country; a reputation which both he and his mother enjoyed as much as if he had been thought the finest scholar.
"The situation of my brother made me at first think my lot the harder, in being continued at school: but I soon changed my opinion; for as I advanced pretty fast in learning, my labours became easy, and my exercise so delightful, that holidays were my most unpleasant time; for my mother, who never loved me, now apprehending that I had the greater share of my father's affection, and finding, or at least thinking, that I was more taken notice of by some gentlemen of learning, and particularly by the parson of the parish, than my brother, she now hated my sight, and made home so disagreeable to me, that what is called by school-boys Black Monday, was to me the whitest in the whole year.
"Having at length gone through the school at Taunton, I was thence removed to Exeter College in Oxford, where I remained four years; at the end of which an accident took me off entirely from my studies; and hence, I may truly date the rise of all which happened to me afterwards in life.
"There was at the same college with myself one Sir George Gresham, a young fellow who was intitled to a very considerable fortune, which he was not, by the will of his father, to come into full possession of till he arrived at the age of twenty-five. However, the liberality of his guardians gave him little cause to regret the abundant caution of his father; for they allowed him five hundred pounds a year while he remained at the university, where he kept his horses and his whore, and lived as wicked and as profligate a life as he could have done had he been never so entirely master of his fortune; for besides the five hundred a year which he received from his guardians, he found means to spend a thousand more. He was above the age of twenty-one, and had no difficulty in gaining what credit he pleased.
"This young fellow, among many other tolerable bad qualities, had one very diabolical. He had a great delight in destroying and ruining the youth of inferior fortune, by drawing them into expenses which they could not afford so well as himself; and the better, and worthier, and soberer any young man was, the greater pleasure and triumph had he in
397
his destruction. Thus acting the character which is recorded of the devil, and going about seeking whom he might devour.
"It was my misfortune to fall into an acquaintance and intimacy with this gentleman. My reputation of diligence in my studies made me a desirable object of his mischievous intention; and my own inclination made it sufficiently easy for him to effect his purpose; for though I had applied myself with much industry to books, in which I took great delight, there were other pleasures in which I was capable of taking much greater; for I was high-mettled, had a violent flow of animal spirits, was a little ambitious, and extremely amorous.
"I had not long contracted an intimacy with Sir George before I became a partaker of all his pleasures; and when I was once entered on that scene, neither my inclination nor my spirit would suffer me to play an under part. I was second to none of the company in any acts of debauchery; nay, I soon distinguished myself so notably in all riots and disorders, that my name generally stood first in the roll of delinquents; and instead of being lamented as the unfortunate pupil of Sir George, I was now accused as the person who had misled and debauched that hopeful young gentleman; for though he was the ringleader and promoter of all the mischief, he was never so considered. I fell at last under the censure of the vice-chancellor, and very narrowly escaped expulsion.
"You will easily believe, sir, that such a life as I am now describing must be incompatible with my further progress in learning; and that in proportion as I addicted myself more and more to loose pleasure, I must grow more and more remiss in application to my studies. This was truly the consequence; but this was not all. My expenses now greatly exceeded not only my former income, but those additions which I extorted from my poor generous father, on pretences of sums being necessary for preparing for my approaching degree of batchelor of arts. These demands, however, grew at last so frequent and exorbitant, that my father by slow degrees opened his ears to the accounts which he received from many quarters of my present behaviour, and which my mother failed not to echo very faithfully and loudly; adding, 'Ay, this is the fine gentleman, the scholar who doth so much honour to his family, and is to be the making of it. I thought what all this learning would come to. He is to be the ruin of us all, I find, after his elder brother hath been denied necessaries for his sake, to perfect his education forsooth, for which he was to pay us such interest: I thought what the interest would come to,' with much more of the same kind; but I have, I believe, satisfied you with this taste.
398
"My father, therefore, began now to return remonstrances instead of money to my demands, which brought my affairs perhaps a little sooner to a crisis; but had he remitted me his whole income, you will imagine it could have sufficed a very short time to support one who kept pace with the expenses of Sir George Gresham.
"It is more than possible that the distress I was now in for money, and the impracticability of going on in this manner, might have restored me at once to my senses and to my studies, had I opened my eyes before I became involved in debts from which I saw no hopes of ever extricating myself. This was indeed the great art of Sir George, and by which he accomplished the ruin of many, whom he afterwards laughed at as fools and coxcombs, for vying, as he called it, with a man of his fortune. To bring this about, he would now and then advance a little money himself, in order to support the credit of the unfortunate youth with other people; till, by means of that very credit, he was irretrievably undone.
"My mind being by these means grown as desperate as my fortune, there was scarce a wickedness which I did not meditate, in order for my relief. Self-murder itself became the subject of my serious deliberation; and I had certainly resolved on it, had not a more shameful, though perhaps less sinful, thought expelled it from my head."一Here he hesitated a moment, and then cried out, "I protest, so many years have not washed away the shame of this act, and I shall blush while I relate it." Jones desired him to pass over anything that might give him pain in the relation; but Partridge eagerly cried out, "Oh, pray, sir, let us hear this; I had rather hear this than all the rest; as I hope to be saved, I will never mention a word of it." Jones was going to rebuke him, but the stranger prevented it by proceeding thus: "I had a chum, a very prudent, frugal young lad, who, though he had no very large allowance, had by his parsimony heaped up upwards of forty guineas, which I knew he kept in his escritore. I took therefore an opportunity of purloining his key from his breeches-pocket, while he was asleep, and thus made myself master of all his riches: after which I again conveyed his key into his pocket, and counterfeiting sleep—though I never once closed my eyes, lay in bed till after he arose and went to prayers一an exercise to which I had long been unaccustomed.
"Timorous thieves, by extreme caution, often subject themselves to discoveries, which those of a bolder kind escape. Thus it happened to me; for had I boldly broke open his escritore, I had, perhaps, escaped even his suspicion; but as it was plain that the person who robbed him had possessed himself of his key, he had no doubt, when he first missed his
399
money, but that his chum was certainly the thief. Now as he was of a fearful disposition, and much my inferior in strength, and I believe in courage, he did not dare to confront me with my guilt, for fear of worse bodily consequences which might happen to him. He repaired therefore immediately to the vice-chancellor, and upon swearing to the robbery, and to the circumstances of it, very easily obtained a warrant against one who had now so bad a character through the whole university.
"Luckily for me, I lay out of the college the next evening; for that day I attended a young lady in a chaise to Witney, where we staid all night, and in our return, the next morning, to Oxford, I met one of my cronies, who acquainted me with sufficient news concerning myself to make me turn my horse another way."
"Pray, sir, did he mention anything of the warrant?" said Partridge. But Jones begged the gentleman to proceed without regarding any impertinent questions; which he did as follows:一
"Having now abandoned all thoughts of returning to Oxford, the next thing which offered itself was a journey to London. I imparted this intention to my female companion, who at first remonstrated against it; but upon producing my wealth, she immediately consented. We then struck across the country, into the great Cirencester road, and made such haste, that we spent the next evening, save one, in London.
"When you consider the place where I now was, and the company with whom I was, you will, I fancy, conceive that a very short time brought me to an end of that sum of which I had so iniquitously possessed myself.
"I was now reduced to a much higher degree of distress than before: the necessaries of life began to be numbered among my wants; and what made my case still the more grievous was, that my paramour, of whom I was now grown immoderately fond, shared the same distresses with myself. To see a woman you love in distress; to be unable to relieve her, and at the same time to reflect that you have brought her into this situation, is perhaps a curse of which no imagination can represent the horrors to those who have not felt it."一"I believe it from my soul," cries Jones, "and I pity you from the bottom of my heart:" he then took two or three disorderly turns about the room, and at last begged pardon, and flung himself into his chair, crying, "I thank Heaven, I have escaped that!"
"This circumstance," continued the gentleman, "so severely aggravated the horrors of my present situation, that they became absolutely
400
intolerable. I could with less pain endure the raging in my own natural unsatisfied appetites, even hunger or thirst, than I could submit to leave ungratified the most whimsical desires of a woman on whom I so extravagantly doated, that, though I knew she had been the mistress of half my acquaintance, I firmly intended to marry her. But the good creature was unwilling to consent to an action which the world might think so much to my disadvantage. And as, possibly, she compassionated the daily anxieties which she must have perceived me suffer on her account, she resolved to put an end to my distress. She soon, indeed, found means to relieve me from my troublesome and perplexed situation; for while I was distracted with various inventions to supply her with pleasures, she very kindly一betrayed me to one of her former lovers at Oxford, by whose care and diligence I was immediately apprehended and committed to gaol.
"Here I first began seriously to reflect on the miscarriages of my former life; on the errors I had been guilty of; on the misfortunes which I had brought on myself; and on the grief which I must have occasioned to one of the best of fathers. When I added to all these the perfidy of my mistress, such was the horror of my mind, that life, instead of being longer desirable, grew the object of my abhorrence; and I could have gladly embraced death as my dearest friend, if it had offered itself to my choice unattended by shame.
"The time of the assizes soon came, and I was removed by habeas corpus to Oxford, where I expected certain conviction and condemnation; but, to my great surprize, none appeared against me, and I was, at the end of the sessions, discharged for want of prosecution. In short, my chum had left Oxford, and whether from indolence, or from what other motive I am ignorant, had declined concerning himself any farther in the affair."
"Perhaps," cries Partridge, "he did not care to have your blood upon his hands; and he was in the right on't. If any person was to be hanged upon my evidence, I should never be able to lie alone afterwards, for fear of seeing his ghost."
"I shall shortly doubt, Partridge," says Jones, "whether thou art more brave or wise."一"You may laugh at me, sir, if you please," answered Partridge; "but if you will hear a very short story which I can tell, and which is most certainly true, perhaps you may change your opinion. In the parish where I was born一" Here Jones would have silenced him; but
401
the stranger interceded that he might be permitted to tell his story, and in the meantime promised to recollect the remainder of his own.
Partridge then proceeded thus: "In the parish where I was born, there lived a farmer whose name was Bridle, and he had a son named Francis, a good hopeful young fellow: I was at the grammar-school with him, where I remember he was got into Ovid's Epistles, and he could construe you three lines together sometimes without looking into a dictionary. Besides all this, he was a very good lad, never missed church o' Sundays, and was reckoned one of the best psalm-singers in the whole parish. He would indeed now and then take a cup too much, and that was the only fault he had."一"Well, but come to the ghost," cries Jones. "Never fear, sir; I shall come to him soon enough," answered Partridge. "You must know, then, that farmer Bridle lost a mare, a sorrel one, to the best of my remembrance; and so it fell out that this young Francis shortly afterward being at a fair at Hindon, and as I think it was on—, I can't remember the day; and being as he was, what should he happen to meet but a man upon his father's mare. Frank called out presently, Stop thief; and it being in the middle of the fair, it was impossible, you know, for the man to make his escape. So they apprehended him and carried him before the justice: I remember it was Justice Willoughby, of Noyle, a very worthy good gentleman; and he committed him to prison, and bound Frank in a recognisance, I think they call it一a hard word compounded of re and cognosce; but it differs in its meaning from the use of the simple, as many other compounds do. Well, at last down came my Lord Justice Page to hold the assizes; and so the fellow was had up, and Frank was had up for a witness. To be sure, I shall never forget the face of the judge, when he began to ask him what he had to say against the prisoner. He made poor Frank tremble and shake in his shoes. 'Well you, fellow,' says my lord, 'what have you to say? Don't stand humming and hawing, but speak out.' But, however, he soon turned altogether as civil to Frank, and began to thunder at the fellow; and when he asked him if he had anything to say for himself, the fellow said, he had found the horse. 'Ay!' answered the judge, 'thou art a lucky fellow: I have travelled the circuit these forty years, and never found a horse in my life: but I'll tell thee what, friend, thou wast more lucky than thou didst know of; for thou didst not only find a horse, but a halter too, I promise thee.' To be sure, I shall never forget the word. Upon which everybody fell a laughing, as how could they help it? Nay, and twenty other jests he made, which I can't remember now. There was something about his skill in horse-flesh which made all the folks laugh. To be certain, the judge must have been a
402
very brave man, as well as a man of much learning. It is indeed charming sport to hear trials upon life and death. One thing I own I thought a little hard, that the prisoner's counsel was not suffered to speak for him, though he desired only to be heard one very short word, but my lord would not hearken to him, though he suffered a counsellor to talk against him for above half-an-hour. I thought it hard, I own, that there should be so many of them; my lord, and the court, and the jury, and the counsellors, and the witnesses, all upon one poor man, and he too in chains. Well, the fellow was hanged, as to be sure it could be no otherwise, and poor Frank could never be easy about it. He never was in the dark alone, but he fancied he saw the fellow's spirit."一"Well, and is this thy story?" cries Jones. "No, no," answered Partridge. "O Lord have mercy upon me! I am just now coming to the matter; for one night, coming from the alehouse, in a long, narrow, dark lane, there he ran directly up against him; and the spirit was all in white, and fell upon Frank; and Frank, who was a sturdy lad, fell upon the spirit again, and there they had a tussel together, and poor Frank was dreadfully beat: indeed he made a shift at last to crawl home; but what with the beating, and what with the fright, he lay ill above a fortnight; and all this is most certainly true, and the whole parish will bear witness to it."
The stranger smiled at this story, and Jones burst into a loud fit of laughter; upon which Partridge cried, "Ay, you may laugh, sir; and so did some others, particularly a squire, who is thought to be no better than an atheist; who, forsooth, because there was a calf with a white face found dead in the same lane the next morning, would fain have it that the battle was between Frank and that, as if a calf would set upon a man. Besides, Frank told me he knew it to be a spirit, and could swear to him in any court in Christendom; and he had not drank above a quart or two or such a matter of liquor, at the time. Lud have mercy upon us, and keep us all from dipping our hands in blood, I say!"
"Well, sir," said Jones to the stranger, "Mr Partridge hath finished his story, and I hope will give you no future interruption, if you will be so kind to proceed." He then resumed his narration; but as he hath taken breath for a while, we think proper to give it to our reader, and shall therefore put an end to this chapter.

Chapter 且
In which the Man of the Hill continues his history.
"I had now regained my liberty," said the stranger; "but I had lost my reputation; for there is a wide difference between the case of a man who is barely acquitted of a crime in a court of justice, and of him who is acquitted in his own heart, and in the opinion of the people. I was conscious of my guilt, and ashamed to look any one in the face; so resolved to leave Oxford the next morning, before the daylight discovered me to the eyes of any beholders.
"When I had got clear of the city, it first entered into my head to return home to my father, and endeavour to obtain his forgiveness; but as I had no reason to doubt his knowledge of all which had past, and as I was well assured of his great aversion to all acts of dishonesty, I could entertain no hopes of being received by him, especially since I was too certain of all the good offices in the power of my mother; nay, had my father's pardon been as sure, as I conceived his resentment to be, I yet question whether I could have had the assurance to behold him, or whether I could, upon any terms, have submitted to live and converse with those who, I was convinced, knew me to have been guilty of so base an action.
"I hastened therefore back to London, the best retirement of either grief or shame, unless for persons of a very public character; for here you have the advantage of solitude without its disadvantage, since you may be alone and in company at the same time; and while you walk or sit unobserved, noise, hurry, and a constant succession of objects, entertain the mind, and prevent the spirits from preying on themselves, or rather on grief or shame, which are the most unwholesome diet in the world; and on which (though there are many who never taste either but in public) there are some who can feed very plentifully and very fatally when alone.
"But as there is scarce any human good without its concomitant evil, so there are people who find an inconvenience in this unobserving
404
temper of mankind; I mean persons who have no money; for as you are not put out of countenance, so neither are you cloathed or fed by those who do not know you. And a man may be as easily starved in Leadenhall-market as in the deserts of Arabia.
"It was at present my fortune to be destitute of that great evil, as it is apprehended to be by several writers, who I suppose were over-burthened with it, namely, money."一"With submission, sir," said Partridge, "I do not remember any writers who have called it malorum; but ir-ritamenta malorum. Effodiuntur opes, irritamenta malorum''一"Well, sir," continued the stranger, "whether it be an evil, or only the cause of evil, I was entirely void of it, and at the same time of friends, and, as I thought, of acquaintance; when one evening, as I was passing through the Inner Temple, very hungry, and very miserable, I heard a voice on a sudden hailing me with great familiarity by my Christian name; and upon turning about, I presently recollected the person who so saluted me to have been my fellow-collegiate; one who had left the university above a year, and long before any of my misfortunes had befallen me. This gentleman, whose name was Watson, shook me heartily by the hand; and expressing great joy at meeting me, proposed our immediately drinking a bottle together. I first declined the proposal, and pretended business, but as he was very earnest and pressing, hunger at last overcame my pride, and I fairly confessed to him I had no money in my pocket; yet not without framing a lie for an excuse, and imputing it to my having changed my breeches that morning. Mr Watson answered, 'I thought, Jack, you and I had been too old acquaintance for you to mention such a matter.' He then took me by the arm, and was pulling me along; but I gave him very little trouble, for my own inclinations pulled me much stronger than he could do.
"We then went into the Friars, which you know is the scene of all mirth and jollity. Here, when we arrived at the tavern, Mr Watson applied himself to the drawer only, without taking the least notice of the cook; for he had no suspicion but that I had dined long since. However, as the case was really otherwise, I forged another falsehood, and told my companion I had been at the further end of the city on business of consequence, and had snapt up a mutton-chop in haste; so that I was again hungry, and wished he would add a beef-steak to his bottle."—"Some people," cries Partridge, "ought to have good memories; or did you find just money enough in your breeches to pay for the mutton-chop?"一"Your observation is right," answered the stranger, "and I believe such blunders are inseparable from all dealing in untruth.一But to
405
proceed一I began now to feel myself extremely happy. The meat and wine soon revived my spirits to a high pitch, and I enjoyed much pleasure in the conversation of my old acquaintance, the rather as I thought him entirely ignorant of what had happened at the university since his leaving it.
"But he did not suffer me to remain long in this agreeable delusion; for taking a bumper in one hand, and holding me by the other, 'Here, my boy,' cries he, 'here's wishing you joy of your being so honourably acquitted of that affair laid to your charge.' I was thunderstruck with confusion at those words, which Watson observing, proceeded thus: 'Nay, never be ashamed, man; thou hast been acquitted, and no one now dares call thee guilty; but, prithee, do tell me, who am thy friend一I hope thou didst really rob him? for rat me if it was not a meritorious action to strip such a sneaking, pitiful rascal; and instead of the two hundred guineas, I wish you had taken as many thousand. Come, come, my boy, don't be shy of confessing to me: you are not now brought before one of the pimps. D—n me if I don't honour you for it; for, as I hope for salvation, I would have made no manner of scruple of doing the same thing.'
"This declaration a little relieved my abashment; and as wine had now somewhat opened my heart, I very freely acknowledged the robbery, but acquainted him that he had been misinformed as to the sum taken, which was little more than a fifth part of what he had mentioned.
I am sorry for it with all my heart,' quoth he, 'and I wish thee better
success another time. Though, if you will take my advice, you shall have no occasion to run any such risque. Here,' said he, taking some dice out of his pocket, 'here's the stuff. Here are the implements; here are the little doctors which cure the distempers of the purse. Follow but my counsel, and I will show you a way to empty the pocket of a queer cull without any danger of the nubbing cheat.'"
"Nubbing cheat!" cries Partridge: "pray, sir, what is that?"
"Why that, sir," says the stranger, "is a cant phrase for the gallows; for as gamesters differ little from highwaymen in their morals, so do they very much resemble them in their language.
"We had now each drank our bottle, when Mr Watson said, the board was sitting, and that he must attend, earnestly pressing me at the same time to go with him and try my fortune. I answered he knew that was at present out of my power, as I had informed him of the emptiness of my pocket. To say the truth, I doubted not from his many strong expressions of friendship, but that he would offer to lend me a small sum for that
n、
406
purpose, but he answered, 'Never mind that, man; e'en boldly run a levant' [Partridge was going to inquire the meaning of that word, but Jones stopped his mouth]: 'but be circumspect as to the man. I will tip you the proper person, which may be necessary, as you do not know the town, nor can distinguish a rum cull from a queer one."
"The bill was now brought, when Watson paid his share, and was departing. I reminded him, not without blushing, of my having no money. He answered, 'That signifies nothing; score it behind the door, or make a bold brush and take no notice.一Or一stay,' says he; 'I will go down-stairs first, and then do you take up my money, and score the whole reckoning at the bar, and I will wait for you at the corner.' I expressed some dislike at this, and hinted my expectations that he would have deposited the whole; but he swore he had not another sixpence in his pocket.
"He then went down, and I was prevailed on to take up the money and follow him, which I did close enough to hear him tell the drawer the reckoning was upon the table. The drawer past by me up-stairs; but I made such haste into the street, that I heard nothing of his disappointment, nor did I mention a syllable at the bar, according to my instructions.
"We now went directly to the gaming-table, where Mr Watson, to my surprize, pulled out a large sum of money and placed it before him, as did many others; all of them, no doubt, considering their own heaps as so many decoy birds, which were to intice and draw over the heaps of their neighbours.
"Here it would be tedious to relate all the freaks which Fortune, or rather the dice, played in this her temple. Mountains of gold were in a few moments reduced to nothing at one part of the table, and rose as suddenly in another. The rich grew in a moment poor, and the poor as suddenly became rich; so that it seemed a philosopher could nowhere have so well instructed his pupils in the contempt of riches, at least he could nowhere have better inculcated the incertainty of their duration.
"For my own part, after having considerably improved my small estate, I at last entirely demolished it. Mr Watson too, after much variety of luck, rose from the table in some heat, and declared he had lost a cool hundred, and would play no longer. Then coming up to me, he asked me to return with him to the tavern; but I positively refused, saying, I would not bring myself a second time into such a dilemma, and especially as he had lost all his money and was now in my own condition. 'Pooh!' says he, 'I have just borrowed a couple of guineas of a friend, and one of them
407
is at your service.' He immediately put one of them into my hand, and I no longer resisted his inclination.
"I was at first a little shocked at returning to the same house whence we had departed in so unhandsome a manner; but when the drawer, with very civil address, told us, 'he believed we had forgot to pay our reckoning,' I became perfectly easy, and very readily gave him a guinea, bid him pay himself, and acquiesced in the unjust charge which had been laid on my memory.
"Mr Watson now bespoke the most extravagant supper he could well think of; and though he had contented himself with simple claret before, nothing now but the most precious Burgundy would serve his purpose.
"Our company was soon encreased by the addition of several gentlemen from the gaming-table; most of whom, as I afterwards found, came not to the tavern to drink, but in the way of business; for the true gamesters pretended to be ill, and refused their glass, while they plied heartily two young fellows, who were to be afterwards pillaged, as indeed they were without mercy. Of this plunder I had the good fortune to be a sharer, though I was not yet let into the secret.
"There was one remarkable accident attended this tavern play; for the money by degrees totally disappeared; so that though at the beginning the table was half covered with gold, yet before the play ended, which it did not till the next day, being Sunday, at noon, there was scarce a single guinea to be seen on the table; and this was the stranger as every person present, except myself, declared he had lost; and what was become of the money, unless the devil himself carried it away, is difficult to determine."
"Most certainly he did," says Partridge, "for evil spirits can carry away anything without being seen, though there were never so many folk in the room; and I should not have been surprized if he had carried away all the company of a set of wicked wretches, who were at play in sermon time. And I could tell you a true story, if I would, where the devil took a man out of bed from another man's wife, and carried him away through the keyhole of the door. I've seen the very house where it was done, and nobody hath lived in it these thirty years."
Though Jones was a little offended by the impertinence of Partridge, he could not however avoid smiling at his simplicity. The stranger did the same, and then proceeded with his story, as will be seen in the next chapter.
408

Chapter 且 U
In which the foregoing story is farther continued.
"My fellow-collegiate had now entered me in a new scene of life. I soon became acquainted with the whole fraternity of sharpers, and was let into their secrets; I mean, into the knowledge of those gross cheats which are proper to impose upon the raw and unexperienced; for there are some tricks of a finer kind, which are known only to a few of the gang, who are at the head of their profession; a degree of honour beyond my expectation; for drink, to which I was immoderately addicted, and the natural warmth of my passions, prevented me from arriving at any great success in an art which requires as much coolness as the most austere school of philosophy.
"Mr Watson, with whom I now lived in the closest amity, had unluckily the former failing to a very great excess; so that instead of making a fortune by his profession, as some others did, he was alternately rich and poor, and was often obliged to surrender to his cooler friends, over a bottle which they never tasted, that plunder that he had taken from culls at the public table.
"However, we both made a shift to pick up an uncomfortable livelihood; and for two years I continued of the calling; during which time I tasted all the varieties of fortune, sometimes flourishing in affluence, and at others being obliged to struggle with almost incredible difficulties. Today wallowing in luxury, and to-morrow reduced to the coarsest and most homely fare. My fine clothes being often on my back in the evening, and at the pawn-shop the next morning.
"One night, as I was returning pennyless from the gaming-table, I observed a very great disturbance, and a large mob gathered together in the street. As I was in no danger from pickpockets, I ventured into the croud, where upon enquiry I found that a man had been robbed and very ill used by some ruffians. The wounded man appeared very bloody, and seemed scarce able to support himself on his legs. As I had not
409
therefore been deprived of my humanity by my present life and conversation, though they had left me very little of either honesty or shame, I immediately offered my assistance to the unhappy person, who thankfully accepted it, and, putting himself under my conduct, begged me to convey him to some tavern, where he might send for a surgeon, being, as he said, faint with loss of blood. He seemed indeed highly pleased at finding one who appeared in the dress of a gentleman; for as to all the rest of the company present, their outside was such that he could not wisely place any confidence in them.
"I took the poor man by the arm, and led him to the tavern where we kept our rendezvous, as it happened to be the nearest at hand. A surgeon happening luckily to be in the house, immediately attended, and applied himself to dressing his wounds, which I had the pleasure to hear were not likely to be mortal.
"The surgeon having very expeditiously and dextrously finished his business, began to enquire in what part of the town the wounded man lodged; who answered, 'That he was come to town that very morning; that his horse was at an inn in Piccadilly, and that he had no other lodging, and very little or no acquaintance in town.'
"This surgeon, whose name I have forgot, though I remember it began with an R, had the first character in his profession, and was serjeant-sur-geon to the king. He had moreover many good qualities, and was a very generous good-natured man, and ready to do any service to his fellowcreatures. He offered his patient the use of his chariot to carry him to his inn, and at the same time whispered in his ear, 'That if he wanted any money, he would furnish him.'
"The poor man was not now capable of returning thanks for this generous offer; for having had his eyes for some time stedfastly on me, he threw himself back in his chair, crying, 'Oh, my son! my son!' and then fainted away.
"Many of the people present imagined this accident had happened through his loss of blood; but I, who at the same time began to recollect the features of my father, was now confirmed in my suspicion, and satisfied that it was he himself who appeared before me. I presently ran to him, raised him in my arms, and kissed his cold lips with the utmost eagerness. Here I must draw a curtain over a scene which I cannot describe; for though I did not lose my being, as my father for a while did, my senses were however so overpowered with affright and surprize, that I am a stranger to what passed during some minutes, and indeed till
410
my father had again recovered from his swoon, and I found myself in his arms, both tenderly embracing each other, while the tears trickled a-pace down the cheeks of each of us.
"Most of those present seemed affected by this scene, which we, who might be considered as the actors in it, were desirous of removing from the eyes of all spectators as fast as we could; my father therefore accepted the kind offer of the surgeon's chariot, and I attended him in it to his inn.
"When we were alone together, he gently upbraided me with having neglected to write to him during so long a time, but entirely omitted the mention of that crime which had occasioned it. He then informed me of my mother's death, and insisted on my returning home with him, saying, 'That he had long suffered the greatest anxiety on my account; that he knew not whether he had most feared my death or wished it, since he had so many more dreadful apprehensions for me. At last, he said, a neighbouring gentleman, who had just recovered a son from the same place, informed him where I was; and that to reclaim me from this course of life was the sole cause of his journey to London.' He thanked Heaven he had succeeded so far as to find me out by means of an accident which had like to have proved fatal to him; and had the pleasure to think he partly owed his preservation to my humanity, with which he profest himself to be more delighted than he should have been with my filial piety, if I had known that the object of all my care was my own father.
"Vice had not so depraved my heart as to excite in it an insensibility of so much paternal affection, though so unworthily bestowed. I presently promised to obey his commands in my return home with him, as soon as he was able to travel, which indeed he was in a very few days, by the assistance of that excellent surgeon who had undertaken his cure.
"The day preceding my father's journey (before which time I scarce ever left him), I went to take my leave of some of my most intimate acquaintance, particularly of Mr Watson, who dissuaded me from burying myself, as he called it, out of a simple compliance with the fond desires of a foolish old fellow. Such sollicitations, however, had no effect, and I once more saw my own home. My father now greatly sollicited me to think of marriage; but my inclinations were utterly averse to any such thoughts. I had tasted of love already, and perhaps you know the extravagant excesses of that most tender and most violent passion."一Here the old gentleman paused, and looked earnestly at Jones; whose
411
countenance, within a minute's space, displayed the extremities of both red and white. Upon which the old man, without making any observations, renewed his narrative.
"Being now provided with all the necessaries of life, I betook myself once again to study, and that with a more inordinate application than I had ever done formerly. The books which now employed my time solely were those, as well antient as modern, which treat of true philosophy, a word which is by many thought to be the subject only of farce and ridicule. I now read over the works of Aristotle and Plato, with the rest of those inestimable treasures which antient Greece had bequeathed to the world.
"These authors, though they instructed me in no science by which men may promise to themselves to acquire the least riches or worldly power, taught me, however, the art of despising the highest acquisitions of both. They elevate the mind, and steel and harden it against the capricious invasions of fortune. They not only instruct in the knowledge of Wisdom, but confirm men in her habits, and demonstrate plainly, that this must be our guide, if we propose ever to arrive at the greatest worldly happiness, or to defend ourselves, with any tolerable security, against the misery which everywhere surrounds and invests us.
"To this I added another study, compared to which, all the philosophy taught by the wisest heathens is little better than a dream, and is indeed as full of vanity as the silliest jester ever pleased to represent it. This is that Divine wisdom which is alone to be found in the Holy Scriptures; for they impart to us the knowledge and assurance of things much more worthy our attention than all which this world can offer to our acceptance; of things which Heaven itself hath condescended to reveal to us, and to the smallest knowledge of which the highest human wit unassisted could never ascend. I began now to think all the time I had spent with the best heathen writers was little more than labour lost: for, however pleasant and delightful their lessons may be, or however adequate to the right regulation of our conduct with respect to this world only; yet, when compared with the glory revealed in Scripture, their highest documents will appear as trifling, and of as little consequence, as the rules by which children regulate their childish little games and pastime. True it is, that philosophy makes us wiser, but Christianity makes us better men. Philosophy elevates and steels the mind, Christianity softens and sweetens it. The former makes us the objects of human admiration, the latter of Divine love. That insures us a temporal, but this an eternal happiness.一But I am afraid I tire you with my rhapsody."
412
"Not at all," cries Partridge; "Lud forbid we should be tired with good things!"
"I had spent," continued the stranger, "about four years in the most delightful manner to myself, totally given up to contemplation, and entirely unembarrassed with the affairs of the world, when I lost the best of fathers, and one whom I so entirely loved, that my grief at his loss exceeds all description. I now abandoned my books, and gave myself up for a whole month to the effects of melancholy and despair. Time, however, the best physician of the mind, at length brought me re-lief."一"Ay, ay; Tempus edax rerum" said Partridge.一"I then," continued the stranger, "betook myself again to my former studies, which I may say perfected my cure; for philosophy and religion may be called the exercises of the mind, and when this is disordered, they are as wholesome as exercise can be to a distempered body. They do indeed produce similar effects with exercise; for they strengthen and confirm the mind, till man becomes, in the noble strain of Horace一
Fortis, et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus, Externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari; In quem manca ruit semper Fortuna.''10
Here Jones smiled at some conceit which intruded itself into his imagination; but the stranger, I believe, perceived it not, and proceeded thus:一
"My circumstances were now greatly altered by the death of that best of men; for my brother, who was now become master of the house, differed so widely from me in his inclinations, and our pursuits in life had been so very various, that we were the worst of company to each other: but what made our living together still more disagreeable, was the little harmony which could subsist between the few who resorted to me, and the numerous train of sportsmen who often attended my brother from the field to the table; for such fellows, besides the noise and nonsense with which they persecute the ears of sober men, endeavour always to attack them with affront and contempt. This was so much the case, that neither I myself, nor my friends, could ever sit down to a meal with them without being treated with derision, because we were unacquainted with the phrases of sportsmen. For men of true learning, and almost universal knowledge, always compassionate the ignorance of others; but fellows who excel in some little, low, contemptible art, are always certain to despise those who are unacquainted with that art.

"In short, we soon separated, and I went, by the advice of a physician, to drink the Bath waters; for my violent affliction, added to a sedentary life, had thrown me into a kind of paralytic disorder, for which those waters are accounted an almost certain cure. The second day after my arrival, as I was walking by the river, the sun shone so intensely hot (though it was early in the year), that I retired to the shelter of some willows, and sat down by the river side. Here I had not been seated long before I heard a person on the other side of the willows sighing and bemoaning himself bitterly. On a sudden, having uttered a most impious oath, he cried, 'I am resolved to bear it no longer,' and directly threw himself into the water. I immediately started, and ran towards the place, calling at the same time as loudly as I could for assistance. An angler happened luckily to be a-fishing a little below me, though some very high sedge had hid him from my sight. He immediately came up, and both of us together, not without some hazard of our lives, drew the body to the shore. At first we perceived no sign of life remaining; but having held the body up by the heels (for we soon had assistance enough), it discharged a vast quantity of water at the mouth, and at length began to discover some symptoms of breathing, and a little afterwards to move both its hands and its legs.
"An apothecary, who happened to be present among others, advised that the body, which seemed now to have pretty well emptied itself of water, and which began to have many convulsive motions, should be directly taken up, and carried into a warm bed. This was accordingly performed, the apothecary and myself attending.
"As we were going towards an inn, for we knew not the man's lodgings, luckily a woman met us, who, after some violent screaming, told us that the gentleman lodged at her house.
"When I had seen the man safely deposited there, I left him to the care of the apothecary; who, I suppose, used all the right methods with him, for the next morning I heard he had perfectly recovered his senses.
"I then went to visit him, intending to search out, as well as I could, the cause of his having attempted so desperate an act, and to prevent, as far as I was able, his pursuing such wicked intentions for the future. I was no sooner admitted into his chamber, than we both instantly knew each other; for who should this person be but my good friend Mr Watson! Here I will not trouble you with what past at our first interview; for I would avoid prolixity as much as possible."一"Pray let us hear all," cries Partridge; "I want mightily to know what brought him to Bath."
414
"You shall hear everything material," answered the stranger; and then proceeded to relate what we shall proceed to write, after we have given a short breathing time to both ourselves and the reader.

In which the Man of the Hill concludes his history.
"Mr Watson," continued the stranger, "very freely acquainted me, that the unhappy situation of his circumstances, occasioned by a tide of ill luck, had in a manner forced him to a resolution of destroying himself.
"I now began to argue very seriously with him, in opposition to this heathenish, or indeed diabolical, principle of the lawfulness of selfmurder; and said everything which occurred to me on the subject; but, to my great concern, it seemed to have very little effect on him. He seemed not at all to repent of what he had done, and gave me reason to fear he would soon make a second attempt of the like horrible kind.
"When I had finished my discourse, instead of endeavouring to answer my arguments, he looked me stedfastly in the face, and with a smile said, 'You are strangely altered, my good friend, since I remember you. I question whether any of our bishops could make a better argument against suicide than you have entertained me with; but unless you can find somebody who will lend me a cool hundred, I must either hang, or drown, or starve; and, in my opinion, the last death is the most terrible of the three.'
"I answered him very gravely that I was indeed altered since I had seen him last. That I had found leisure to look into my follies and to repent of them. I then advised him to pursue the same steps; and at last concluded with an assurance that I myself would lend him a hundred pound, if it would be of any service to his affairs, and he would not put it into the power of a die to deprive him of it.
"Mr Watson, who seemed almost composed in slumber by the former part of my discourse, was roused by the latter. He seized my hand eagerly, gave me a thousand thanks, and declared I was a friend indeed; adding that he hoped I had a better opinion of him than to imagine he had profited so little by experience, as to put any confidence in those damned dice which had so often deceived him. 'No, no,' cries he; 'let me
416
but once handsomely be set up again, and if ever Fortune makes a broken merchant of me afterwards, I will forgive her.'
"I very well understood the language of setting up, and broken merchant. I therefore said to him, with a very grave face, Mr Watson, you must endeavour to find out some business or employment, by which you may procure yourself a livelihood; and I promise you, could I see any probability of being repaid hereafter, I would advance a much larger sum than what you have mentioned, to equip you in any fair and honourable calling; but as to gaming, besides the baseness and wickedness of making it a profession, you are really, to my own knowledge, unfit for it, and it will end in your certain ruin.
"'Why now, that's strange,' answered he; 'neither you, nor any of my friends, would ever allow me to know anything of the matter, and yet I believe I am as good a hand at every game as any of you all; and I heartily wish I was to play with you only for your whole fortune: I should desire no better sport, and I would let you name your game into the bargain: but come, my dear boy, have you the hundred in your pocket?"
"I answered I had only a bill for £50, which I delivered him, and promised to bring him the rest next morning; and after giving him a little more advice, took my leave.
"I was indeed better than my word; for I returned to him that very afternoon. When I entered the room, I found him sitting up in his bed at cards with a notorious gamester. This sight, you will imagine, shocked me not a little; to which I may add the mortification of seeing my bill delivered by him to his antagonist, and thirty guineas only given in exchange for it.
"The other gamester presently quitted the room, and then Watson declared he was ashamed to see me; 'but,' says he, 'I find luck runs so damnably against me, that I will resolve to leave off play for ever. I have thought of the kind proposal you made me ever since, and I promise you there shall be no fault in me, if I do not put it in execution.'
"Though I had no great faith in his promises, I produced him the remainder of the hundred in consequence of my own; for which he gave me a note, which was all I ever expected to see in return for my money.
"We were prevented from any further discourse at present by the arrival of the apothecary; who, with much joy in his countenance, and without even asking his patient how he did, proclaimed there was great news arrived in a letter to himself, which he said would shortly be public, 'That the Duke of Monmouth was landed in the west with a vast
417
army of Dutch; and that another vast fleet hovered over the coast of Norfolk, and was to make a descent there, in order to favour the duke's enterprize with a diversion on that side.'
"This apothecary was one of the greatest politicians of his time. He was more delighted with the most paultry packet, than with the best patient, and the highest joy he was capable of, he received from having a piece of news in his possession an hour or two sooner than any other person in the town. His advices, however, were seldom authentic; for he would swallow almost anything as a truth一a humour which many made use of to impose upon him.
"Thus it happened with what he at present communicated; for it was known within a short time afterwards that the duke was really landed, but that his army consisted only of a few attendants; and as to the diversion in Norfolk, it was entirely false.
"The apothecary staid no longer in the room than while he acquainted us with his news; and then, without saying a syllable to his patient on any other subject, departed to spread his advices all over the town.
"Events of this nature in the public are generally apt to eclipse all private concerns. Our discourse therefore now became entirely political. 11

15	For my own part, I had been for some time very seriously affected with the danger to which the Protestant religion was so visibly exposed under a Popish prince, and thought the apprehension of it alone sufficient to justify that insurrection; for no real security can ever be found against the persecuting spirit of Popery, when armed with power, except the depriving it of that power, as woeful experience presently showed. You know how King James behaved after getting the better of this attempt; how little he valued either his royal word, or coronation oath, or the liberties and rights of his people. But all had not the sense to foresee this at first; and therefore the Duke of Monmouth was weakly supported; yet all could feel when the evil came upon them; and therefore all united, at last, to drive out that king, against whose exclusion a great

party among us had so warmly contended during the reign of his brother, and for whom they now fought with such zeal and affection."
"What you say," interrupted Jones, "is very true; and it has often struck me, as the most wonderful thing I ever read of in history, that so soon
12.	"For my own part, I had been for some time very seriously affected with the danger to which the Protestant religion was so visibly exposed, that nothing but the immediate interposition of Providence seemed capable of preserving it; for King James had indeed declared war against the Protestant cause. He had brought known papists into the army and attempted to bring them into the Church and into the University. Popish priests swarmed through the nation, appeared publicly in their habits, and boasted that they should shortly walk in procession through the streets. Our own clergy were forbid to preach against popery, and bishops were ordered to supend those who did; and to do the business at once an illegal ecclesiastical commission was erected, little inferior to an inquisition, of which, probably, it was intended to be the ringleader. Thus, as our duty to the king can never be called more than our second duty, he had discharged us from this by making it incompatible with our preserving the first, which is surely to heaven. Besides this, he had dissolved his subjects from their allegiance by breaking his Coronation Oath, to which their allegiance is annexed; for he had imprisoned bishops because they would not give up their religion, and turned out judges because they would not absolutely surrender the law into his hands; nay, he seized this himself, and when he claimed a dispensing power, he declared himself, in fact, as absolute as any tyrant ever was or can be. I have recapitulated these matters in full lest some of them should have been omitted in history; and I think nothing less than such provocations as I have here mentioned, nothing less than certain and imminent danger to their religion and liberties, can justify or even mitigate the dreadful sin of rebellion in any people."
13.	"I promise you, sir," says Jones, "all these facts, and more, I have read in history, but I will tell you a fact which is not yet recorded and of which I suppose you are ignorant. There is actually now a rebellion on foot in this kingdom in favour of the son of that very King James, a professed papist, more bigoted, if possible, than his father, and this carried on by Protestants against a king who hath never in one single instance made the least invasion on our liberties."
14.	"Prodigious indeed!" answered the stranger. "You tell me what would be incredible of a nation which did not deserve the character that Virgil gives of a woman, varium et mutabile semper. Surely this is to be unworthy of the care which Providence seems to have taken of us in the preservation of our religion against the powerful designs and constant machinations of Popery, a preservation so strange and unaccountable that I almost think we may appeal to it as to a miracle for the proof of its holiness. Prodigious indeed! A Protestant rebellion in favour of a popish prince! The folly of mankind is as wonderful as their knavery—But to conclude my story: I resolved to take arms in defence of my country, of my religion, and my liberty, and Mr. Watson joined in the same resolution. We soon provided ourselves with an necessaries and joined the Duke at Bridgewater."
15.	"The unfortunate event of this enterprise you are perhaps better acquainted with than myself. I escaped together with Mr. Watson from the battle at Sedgemore,...
419
after this convincing experience which brought our whole nation to join so unanimously in expelling King James, for the preservation of our religion and liberties, there should be a party among us mad enough to desire the placing his family again on the throne." "You are not in earnest!" answered the old man; "there can be no such party. As bad an opinion as I have of mankind, I cannot believe them infatuated to such a degree. There may be some hot-headed Papists led by their priests to engage in this desperate cause, and think it a holy war; but that Protestants, that are members of the Church of England, should be such apostates, such felos de se, I cannot believe it; no, no, young man, unacquainted as I am with what has past in the world for these last thirty years, I cannot be so imposed upon as to credit so foolish a tale; but I see you have a mind to sport with my ignorance."一"Can it be possible," replied Jones, "that you have lived so much out of the world as not to know that during that time there have been two rebellions in favour of the son of King James, one of which is now actually raging in the very heart of the kingdom." At these words the old gentleman started up, and in a most solemn tone of voice, conjured Jones by his Maker to tell him if what he said was really true; which the other as solemnly affirming, he walked several turns about the room in a profound silence, then cried, then laughed, and at last fell down on his knees, and blessed God, in a loud thanksgiving prayer, for having delivered him from all society with human nature, which could be capable of such monstrous extravagances. After which, being reminded by Jones that he had broke off his story, he resumed it again in this manner:一
"As mankind, in the days I was speaking of, was not yet arrived at that pitch of madness which I find they are capable of now, and which, to be sure, I have only escaped by living alone, and at a distance from the contagion, there was a considerable rising in favour of Monmouth; and my principles strongly inclining me to take the same part, I determined to join him; and Mr Watson, from different motives concurring in the same resolution (for the spirit of a gamester will carry a man as far upon such an occasion as the spirit of patriotism), we soon provided ourselves with all necessaries, and went to the duke at Bridgewater.
"The unfortunate event of this enterprize, you are, I conclude, as well acquainted with as myself. I escaped, together with Mr Watson, from the battle at Sedgemore, in which action I received a slight wound. We rode near forty miles together on the Exeter road, and then abandoning our horses, scrambled as well as we could through the fields and bye-roads, till we arrived at a little wild hut on a common, where a poor old woman
420
took all the care of us she could, and dressed my wound with salve, which quickly healed it."
"Pray, sir, where was the wound?" says Partridge. The stranger satisfied him it was in his arm, and then continued his narrative. "Here, sir," said he, "Mr Watson left me the next morning, in order, as he pretended, to get us some provision from the town of Collumpton; but一can I relate it, or can you believe it?一this Mr Watson, this friend, this base, barbarous, treacherous villain, betrayed me to a party of horse belonging to King James, and at his return delivered me into their hands.
"The soldiers, being six in number, had now seized me, and were conducting me to Taunton gaol; but neither my present situation, nor the apprehensions of what might happen to me, were half so irksome to my mind as the company of my false friend, who, having surrendered himself, was likewise considered as a prisoner, though he was better treated, as being to make his peace at my expense. He at first endeavoured to excuse his treachery; but when he received nothing but scorn and upbraiding from me, he soon changed his note, abused me as the most atrocious and malicious rebel, and laid all his own guilt to my charge, who, as he declared, had solicited, and even threatened him, to make him take up arms against his gracious as well as lawful sovereign.
"This false evidence (for in reality he had been much the forwarder of the two) stung me to the quick, and raised an indignation scarce conceivable by those who have not felt it. However, fortune at length took pity on me; for as we were got a little beyond Wellington, in a narrow lane, my guards received a false alarm, that near fifty of the enemy were at hand; upon which they shifted for themselves, and left me and my betrayer to do the same. That villain immediately ran from me, and I am glad he did, or I should have certainly endeavoured, though I had no arms, to have executed vengeance on his baseness.
"I was now once more at liberty; and immediately withdrawing from the highway into the fields, I travelled on, scarce knowing which way I went, and making it my chief care to avoid all public roads and all towns一nay, even the most homely houses; for I imagined every human creature whom I saw desirous of betraying me.
"At last, after rambling several days about the country, during which the fields afforded me the same bed and the same food which nature bestows on our savage brothers of the creation, I at length arrived at this place, where the solitude and wildness of the country invited me to fix my abode. The first person with whom I took up my habitation was the
421
mother of this old woman, with whom I remained concealed till the news of the glorious revolution put an end to all my apprehensions of danger, and gave me an opportunity of once more visiting my own home, and of enquiring a little into my affairs, which I soon settled as agreeably to my brother as to myself; having resigned everything to him, for which he paid me the sum of a thousand pounds, and settled on me an annuity for life.
"His behaviour in this last instance, as in all others, was selfish and ungenerous. I could not look on him as my friend, nor indeed did he desire that I should; so I presently took my leave of him, as well as of my other acquaintance; and from that day to this, my history is little better than a blank."
"And is it possible, sir," said Jones, "that you can have resided here from that day to this?"一"O no, sir," answered the gentleman; "I have been a great traveller, and there are few parts of Europe with which I am not acquainted." "I have not, sir," cried Jones, "the assurance to ask it of you now; indeed it would be cruel, after so much breath as you have already spent: but you will give me leave to wish for some further opportunity of hearing the excellent observations which a man of your sense and knowledge of the world must have made in so long a course of travels."一"Indeed, young gentleman," answered the stranger, "I will endeavour to satisfy your curiosity on this head likewise, as far as I am able." Jones attempted fresh apologies, but was prevented; and while he and Partridge sat with greedy and impatient ears, the stranger proceeded as in the next chapter.

Chapter 且 U
A brief history of Europe; and a curious discourse between Mr Jones and the Man of the Hill.
"In Italy the landlords are very silent. In France they are more talkative, but yet civil. In Germany and Holland they are generally very impertinent. And as for their honesty, I believe it is pretty equal in all those countries. The laquais a louange are sure to lose no opportunity of cheating you; and as for the postilions, I think they are pretty much alike all the world over. These, sir, are the observations on men which I made in my travels; for these were the only men I ever conversed with. My design, when I went abroad, was to divert myself by seeing the wondrous variety of prospects, beasts, birds, fishes, insects, and vegetables, with which God has been pleased to enrich the several parts of this globe; a variety which, as it must give great pleasure to a contemplative beholder, so doth it admirably display the power, and wisdom, and goodness of the Creator. Indeed, to say the truth, there is but one work in his whole creation that doth him any dishonour, and with that I have long since avoided holding any conversation."
"You will pardon me," cries Jones; "but I have always imagined that there is in this very work you mention as great variety as in all the rest; for, besides the difference of inclination, customs and climates have, I am told, introduced the utmost diversity into human nature."
"Very little indeed," answered the other: "those who travel in order to acquaint themselves with the different manners of men might spare themselves much pains by going to a carnival at Venice; for there they will see at once all which they can discover in the several courts of Europe. The same hypocrisy, the same fraud; in short, the same follies and vices dressed in different habits. In Spain, these are equipped with much gravity; and in Italy, with vast splendor. In France, a knave is dressed like a fop; and in the northern countries, like a sloven. But human nature is everywhere the same, everywhere the object of detestation and scorn.
423
"As for my own part, I past through all these nations as you perhaps may have done through a croud at a shew-jostling to get by them, holding my nose with one hand, and defending my pockets with the other, without speaking a word to any of them, while I was pressing on to see what I wanted to see; which, however entertaining it might be in itself, scarce made me amends for the trouble the company gave me."
"Did not you find some of the nations among which you travelled less troublesome to you than others?" said Jones. "O yes," replied the old man: "the Turks were much more tolerable to me than the Christians; for they are men of profound taciturnity, and never disturb a stranger with questions. Now and then indeed they bestow a short curse upon him, or spit in his face as he walks the streets, but then they have done with him; and a man may live an age in their country without hearing a dozen words from them. But of all the people I ever saw, heaven defend me from the French! With their damned prate and civilities, and doing the honour of their nation to strangers (as they are pleased to call it), but indeed setting forth their own vanity; they are so troublesome, that I had infinitely rather pass my life with the Hottentots than set my foot in Paris again. They are a nasty people, but their nastiness is mostly without; whereas, in France, and some other nations that I won't name, it is all within, and makes them stink much more to my reason than that of Hottentots does to my nose.
"Thus, sir, I have ended the history of my life; for as to all that series of years during which I have lived retired here, it affords no variety to entertain you, and may be almost considered as one day. 16 The retirement has been so compleat, that I could hardly have enjoyed a more absolute solitude in the deserts of the Thebais than here in the midst of this populous kingdom. As I have no estate, I am plagued with no tenants or stewards: my annuity is paid me pretty regularly, as indeed it ought to be; for it is much less than what I might have expected in return for what I gave up. Visits I admit none; and the old woman who keeps my house knows that her place entirely depends upon her saving me all the trouble of buying the things that I want, keeping off all sollicitation or business from me, and holding her tongue whenever I am within hearing. As my walks are all by night, I am pretty secure in this wild unfrequented place from meeting any company. Some few persons I have met by chance, and sent them home heartily frighted, as from the oddness of my dress and figure they took me for a ghost or a hobgoblin. But what has
16.the rest of this paragraph is omitted in the third edition
424
happened to-night shows that even here I cannot be safe from the villany of men; for without your assistance I had not only been robbed, but very probably murdered."
Jones thanked the stranger for the trouble he had taken in relating his story, and then expressed some wonder how he could possibly endure a life of such solitude; "in which," says he, "you may well complain of the want of variety. Indeed I am astonished how you have filled up, or rather killed, so much of your time."
"I am not at all surprized," answered the other, "that to one whose affections and thoughts are fixed on the world my hours should appear to have wanted employment in this place: but there is one single act, for which the whole life of man is infinitely too short: what time can suffice for the contemplation and worship of that glorious, immortal, and eternal Being, among the works of whose stupendous creation not only this globe, but even those numberless luminaries which we may here behold spangling all the sky, though they should many of them be suns lighting different systems of worlds, may possibly appear but as a few atoms opposed to the whole earth which we inhabit? Can a man who by divine meditations is admitted as it were into the conversation of this ineffable, incomprehensible Majesty, think days, or years, or ages, too long for the continuance of so ravishing an honour? Shall the trifling amusements, the palling pleasures, the silly business of the world, roll away our hours too swiftly from us; and shall the pace of time seem sluggish to a mind exercised in studies so high, so important, and so glorious? As no time is sufficient, so no place is improper, for this great concern. On what object can we cast our eyes which may not inspire us with ideas of his power, of his wisdom, and of his goodness? It is not necessary that the rising sun should dart his fiery glories over the eastern horizon; nor that the boisterous winds should rush from their caverns, and shake the lofty forest; nor that the opening clouds should pour their deluges on the plains: it is not necessary, I say, that any of these should proclaim his majesty: there is not an insect, not a vegetable, of so low an order in the creation as not to be honoured with bearing marks of the attributes of its great Creator; marks not only of his power, but of his wisdom and goodness. Man alone, the king of this globe, the last and greatest work of the Supreme Being, below the sun; man alone hath basely dishonoured his own nature; and by dishonesty, cruelty, ingratitude, and treachery, hath called his Maker's goodness in question, by puzzling us to account how a benevolent being should form so foolish and so vile an animal. Yet this is the being from whose conversation you think, I suppose, that I have
425
been unfortunately restrained, and without whose blessed society, life, in your opinion, must be tedious and insipid."
"In the former part of what you said," replied Jones, "I most heartily and readily concur; but I believe, as well as hope, that the abhorrence which you express for mankind in the conclusion, is much too general. Indeed, you here fall into an error, which in my little experience I have observed to be a very common one, by taking the character of mankind from the worst and basest among them; whereas, indeed, as an excellent writer observes, nothing should be esteemed as characteristical of a species, but what is to be found among the best and most perfect individuals of that species. This error, I believe, is generally committed by those who from want of proper caution in the choice of their friends and acquaintance, have suffered injuries from bad and worthless men; two or three instances of which are very unjustly charged on all human nature."
"I think I had experience enough of it," answered the other: "my first mistress and my first friend betrayed me in the basest manner, and in matters which threatened to be of the worst of consequences一even to bring me to a shameful death."
"But you will pardon me," cries Jones, "if I desire you to reflect who that mistress and who that friend were. What better, my good sir, could be expected in love derived from the stews, or in friendship first produced and nourished at the gaming-table? To take the characters of women from the former instance, or of men from the latter, would be as unjust as to assert that air is a nauseous and unwholesome element, because we find it so in a jakes. I have lived but a short time in the world, and yet have known men worthy of the highest friendship, and women of the highest love."
"Alas! young man," answered the stranger, "you have lived, you confess, but a very short time in the world: I was somewhat older than you when I was of the same opinion."
"You might have remained so still," replies Jones, "if you had not been unfortunate, I will venture to say incautious, in the placing your affections. If there was, indeed, much more wickedness in the world than there is, it would not prove such general assertions against human nature, since much of this arrives by mere accident, and many a man who commits evil is not totally bad and corrupt in his heart. In truth, none seem to have any title to assert human nature to be necessarily and universally evil, but those whose own minds afford them one instance of this natural depravity; which is not, I am convinced, your case."
426
"And such," said the stranger, "will be always the most backward to assert any such thing. Knaves will no more endeavour to persuade us of the baseness of mankind, than a highwayman will inform you that there are thieves on the road. This would, indeed, be a method to put you on your guard, and to defeat their own purposes. For which reason, though knaves, as I remember, are very apt to abuse particular persons, yet they never cast any reflection on human nature in general." The old gentleman spoke this so warmly, that as Jones despaired of making a convert, and was unwilling to offend, he returned no answer.
The day now began to send forth its first streams of light, when Jones made an apology to the stranger for having staid so long, and perhaps detained him from his rest. The stranger answered, "He never wanted rest less than at present; for that day and night were indifferent seasons to him; and that he commonly made use of the former for the time of his repose and of the latter for his walks and lucubrations. However," said he, "it is now a most lovely morning, and if you can bear any longer to be without your own rest or food, I will gladly entertain you with the sight of some very fine prospects which I believe you have not yet seen."
Jones very readily embraced this offer, and they immediately set forward together from the cottage. As for Partridge, he had fallen into a profound repose just as the stranger had finished his story; for his curiosity was satisfied, and the subsequent discourse was not forcible enough in its operation to conjure down the charms of sleep. Jones therefore left him to enjoy his nap; and as the reader may perhaps be at this season glad of the same favour, we will here put an end to the eighth book of our history.

Chapter 且
Of those who lawfully may, and of those who may not, write such histories as this.
Among other good uses for which I have thought proper to institute these several introductory chapters, I have considered them as a kind of mark or stamp, which may hereafter enable a very indifferent reader to distinguish what is true and genuine in this historic kind of writing, from what is false and counterfeit. Indeed, it seems likely that some such mark may shortly become necessary, since the favourable reception which two or three authors have lately procured for their works of this nature from the public, will probably serve as an encouragement to many others to undertake the like. Thus a swarm of foolish novels and monstrous romances will be produced, either to the great impoverishing of booksellers, or to the great loss of time and depravation of morals in the reader; nay, often to the spreading of scandal and calumny, and to the prejudice of the characters of many worthy and honest people.
I question not but the ingenious author of the Spectator was principally induced to prefix Greek and Latin mottos to every paper, from the same consideration of guarding against the pursuit of those scribblers, who having no talents of a writer but what is taught by the writing-master, are yet nowise afraid nor ashamed to assume the same titles with the greatest genius, than their good brother in the fable was of braying in the lion's skin.
By the device therefore of his motto, it became impracticable for any man to presume to imitate the Spectators, without understanding at least one sentence in the learned languages. In the same manner I have now secured myself from the imitation of those who are utterly incapable of any degree of reflection, and whose learning is not equal to an essay.
I would not be here understood to insinuate, that the greatest merit of such historical productions can ever lie in these introductory chapters; but, in fact, those parts which contain mere narrative only, afford much
429
more encouragement to the pen of an imitator, than those which are composed of observation and reflection. Here I mean such imitators as Rowe was of Shakespear, or as Horace hints some of the Romans were of Cato, by bare feet and sour faces.
To invent good stories, and to tell them well, are possibly very rare talents, and yet I have observed few persons who have scrupled to aim at both: and if we examine the romances and novels with which the world abounds, I think we may fairly conclude, that most of the authors would not have attempted to show their teeth (if the expression may be allowed me) in any other way of writing; nor could indeed have strung together a dozen sentences on any other subject whatever.
Scribimus indocti doctique passim,17
may be more truly said of the historian and biographer, than of any other species of writing; for all the arts and sciences (even criticism itself) require some little degree of learning and knowledge. Poetry, indeed, may perhaps be thought an exception; but then it demands numbers, or something like numbers: whereas, to the composition of novels and romances, nothing is necessary but paper, pens, and ink, with the manual capacity of using them. This, I conceive, their productions show to be the opinion of the authors themselves: and this must be the opinion of their readers, if indeed there be any such.
Hence we are to derive that universal contempt which the world, who always denominate the whole from the majority, have cast on all historical writers who do not draw their materials from records. And it is the apprehension of this contempt that hath made us so cautiously avoid the term romance, a name with which we might otherwise have been well enough contented. Though, as we have good authority for all our characters, no less indeed than the vast authentic doomsday-book of nature, as is elsewhere hinted, our labours have sufficient title to the name of history. Certainly they deserve some distinction from those works, which one of the wittiest of men regarded only as proceeding from a pruritus, or indeed rather from a looseness of the brain.
But besides the dishonour which is thus cast on one of the most useful as well as entertaining of all kinds of writing, there is just reason to apprehend, that by encouraging such authors we shall propagate much dishonour of another kind; I mean to the characters of many good and
17.一Each desperate blockhead dares to write: Verse is the trade of every living wight.—FRANCIS.
430
valuable members of society; for the dullest writers, no more than the dullest companions, are always inoffensive. They have both enough of language to be indecent and abusive. And surely if the opinion just above cited be true, we cannot wonder that works so nastily derived should be nasty themselves, or have a tendency to make others so.
To prevent therefore, for the future, such intemperate abuses of leisure, of letters, and of the liberty of the press, especially as the world seems at present to be more than usually threatened with them, I shall here venture to mention some qualifications, every one of which are in a pretty high degree necessary to this order of historians.
The first is, genius, without a full vein of which no study, says Horace, can avail us. By genius I would understand that power or rather those powers of the mind, which are capable of penetrating into all things within our reach and knowledge, and of distinguishing their essential differences. These are no other than invention and judgment; and they are both called by the collective name of genius, as they are of those gifts of nature which we bring with us into the world. Concerning each of which many seem to have fallen into very great errors; for by invention, I believe, is generally understood a creative faculty, which would indeed prove most romance writers to have the highest pretensions to it; whereas by invention is really meant no more (and so the word signifies) than discovery, or finding out; or to explain it at large, a quick and sagacious penetration into the true essence of all the objects of our contemplation. This, I think, can rarely exist without the concomitancy of judgment; for how we can be said to have discovered the true essence of two things, without discerning their difference, seems to me hard to conceive. Now this last is the undisputed province of judgment, and yet some few men of wit have agreed with all the dull fellows in the world in representing these two to have been seldom or never the property of one and the same person.
But though they should be so, they are not sufficient for our purpose, without a good share of learning; for which I could again cite the authority of Horace, and of many others, if any was necessary to prove that tools are of no service to a workman, when they are not sharpened by art, or when he wants rules to direct him in his work, or hath no matter to work upon. All these uses are supplied by learning; for nature can only furnish us with capacity; or, as I have chose to illustrate it, with the tools of our profession; learning must fit them for use, must direct them in it, and, lastly, must contribute part at least of the materials. A competent knowledge of history and of the belles-lettres is here absolutely
431
necessary; and without this share of knowledge at least, to affect the character of an historian, is as vain as to endeavour at building a house without timber or mortar, or brick or stone. Homer and Milton, who, though they added the ornament of numbers to their works, were both historians of our order, were masters of all the learning of their times.
Again, there is another sort of knowledge, beyond the power of learning to bestow, and this is to be had by conversation. So necessary is this to the understanding the characters of men, that none are more ignorant of them than those learned pedants whose lives have been entirely consumed in colleges, and among books; for however exquisitely human nature may have been described by writers, the true practical system can be learnt only in the world. Indeed the like happens in every other kind of knowledge. Neither physic nor law are to be practically known from books. Nay, the farmer, the planter, the gardener, must perfect by experience what he hath acquired the rudiments of by reading. How accurately soever the ingenious Mr Miller may have described the plant, he himself would advise his disciple to see it in the garden. As we must perceive, that after the nicest strokes of a Shakespear or a Jonson, of a Wycherly or an Otway, some touches of nature will escape the reader, which the judicious action of a Garrick, of a Cibber, or a Clive,18 can convey to him; so, on the real stage, the character shows himself in a stronger and bolder light than he can be described. And if this be the case in those fine and nervous descriptions which great authors themselves have taken from life, how much more strongly will it hold when the writer himself takes his lines not from nature, but from books? Such characters are only the faint copy of a copy, and can have neither the justness nor spirit of an original.
Now this conversation in our historian must be universal, that is, with all ranks and degrees of men; for the knowledge of what is called high life will not instruct him in low; nor, e converse, will his being acquainted with the inferior part of mankind teach him the manners of the superior. And though it may be thought that the knowledge of either may sufficiently enable him to describe at least that in which he hath been conversant, yet he will even here fall greatly short of perfection; for the follies of either rank do in reality illustrate each other. For instance, the
18.There is a peculiar propriety in mentioning this great actor, and these two most justly celebrated actresses, in this place, as they have all formed themselves on the study of nature only, and not on the imitation of their predecessors. Hence they have been able to excel all who have gone before them; a degree of merit which the servile herd of imitators can never possibly arrive at.
432
affectation of high life appears more glaring and ridiculous from the simplicity of the low; and again, the rudeness and barbarity of this latter, strikes with much stronger ideas of absurdity, when contrasted with, and opposed to, the politeness which controuls the former. Besides, to say the truth, the manners of our historian will be improved by both these conversations; for in the one he will easily find examples of plainness, honesty, and sincerity; in the other of refinement, elegance, and a liberality of spirit; which last quality I myself have scarce ever seen in men of low birth and education.
Nor will all the qualities I have hitherto given my historian avail him, unless he have what is generally meant by a good heart, and be capable of feeling. The author who will make me weep, says Horace, must first weep himself. In reality, no man can paint a distress well which he doth not feel while he is painting it; nor do I doubt, but that the most pathetic and affecting scenes have been writ with tears. In the same manner it is with the ridiculous. I am convinced I never make my reader laugh heartily but where I have laughed before him; unless it should happen at any time, that instead of laughing with me he should be inclined to laugh at me. Perhaps this may have been the case at some passages in this chapter, from which apprehension I will here put an end to it.

Chapter
Containing a very surprizing adventure indeed, which Mr Jones met with in his walk with the Man of the Hill.
Aurora now first opened her casement, Anglice the day began to break, when Jones walked forth in company with the stranger, and mounted Mazard Hill; of which they had no sooner gained the summit than one of the most noble prospects in the world presented itself to their view, and which we would likewise present to the reader, but for two reasons: first, we despair of making those who have seen this prospect admire our description; secondly, we very much doubt whether those who have not seen it would understand it.
Jones stood for some minutes fixed in one posture, and directing his eyes towards the south; upon which the old gentleman asked, What he was looking at with so much attention? "Alas! sir," answered he with a sigh, "I was endeavouring to trace out my own journey hither. Good heavens! what a distance is Gloucester from us! What a vast track of land must be between me and my own home!"一"Ay, ay, young gentleman," cries the other, "and by your sighing, from what you love better than your own home, or I am mistaken. I perceive now the object of your contemplation is not within your sight, and yet I fancy you have a pleasure in looking that way." Jones answered with a smile, "I find, old friend, you have not yet forgot the sensations of your youth. I own my thoughts were employed as you have guessed."
They now walked to that part of the hill which looks to the north-west, and which hangs over a vast and extensive wood. Here they were no sooner arrived than they heard at a distance the most violent screams of a woman, proceeding from the wood below them. Jones listened a moment, and then, without saying a word to his companion (for indeed the occasion seemed sufficiently pressing), ran, or rather slid, down the hill, and, without the least apprehension or concern for his own safety, made directly to the thicket, whence the sound had issued.
434
He had not entered far into the wood before he beheld a most shocking sight indeed, a woman stript half naked, under the hands of a ruffian, who had put his garter round her neck, and was endeavouring to draw her up to a tree. Jones asked no questions at this interval, but fell instantly upon the villain, and made such good use of his trusty oaken stick that he laid him sprawling on the ground before he could defend himself, indeed almost before he knew he was attacked; nor did he cease the prosecution of his blows till the woman herself begged him to forbear, saying, she believed he had sufficiently done his business.
The poor wretch then fell upon her knees to Jones, and gave him a thousand thanks for her deliverance. He presently lifted her up, and told her he was highly pleased with the extraordinary accident which had sent him thither for her relief, where it was so improbable she should find any; adding, that Heaven seemed to have designed him as the happy instrument of her protection. "Nay," answered she, "I could almost conceive you to be some good angel; and, to say the truth, you look more like an angel than a man in my eye." Indeed he was a charming figure; and if a very fine person, and a most comely set of features, adorned with youth, health, strength, freshness, spirit, and good-nature, can make a man resemble an angel, he certainly had that resemblance.
The redeemed captive had not altogether so much of the human-angelic species: she seemed to be at least of the middle age, nor had her face much appearance of beauty; but her cloaths being torn from all the upper part of her body, her breasts, which were well formed and extremely white, attracted the eyes of her deliverer, and for a few moments they stood silent, and gazing at each other; till the ruffian on the ground beginning to move, Jones took the garter which had been intended for another purpose, and bound both his hands behind him. And now, on contemplating his face, he discovered, greatly to his surprize, and perhaps not a little to his satisfaction, this very person to be no other than ensign Northerton. Nor had the ensign forgotten his former antagonist, whom he knew the moment he came to himself. His surprize was equal to that of Jones; but I conceive his pleasure was rather less on this occasion.
Jones helped Northerton upon his legs, and then looking him sted-fastly in the face, "I fancy, sir," said he, "you did not expect to meet me any more in this world, and I confess I had as little expectation to find you here. However, fortune, I see, hath brought us once more together, and hath given me satisfaction for the injury I have received, even without my own knowledge."
435
"It is very much like a man of honour, indeed," answered Northerton, "to take satisfaction by knocking a man down behind his back. Neither am I capable of giving you satisfaction here, as I have no sword; but if you dare behave like a gentleman, let us go where I can furnish myself with one, and I will do by you as a man of honour ought."
"Doth it become such a villain as you are," cries Jones, "to contaminate the name of honour by assuming it? But I shall waste no time in discourse with you. Justice requires satisfaction of you now, and shall have it." Then turning to the woman, he asked her, if she was near her home; or if not, whether she was acquainted with any house in the neighbourhood, where she might procure herself some decent cloaths, in order to proceed to a justice of the peace.
She answered she was an entire stranger in that part of the world. Jones then recollecting himself, said, he had a friend near who would direct them; indeed, he wondered at his not following; but, in fact, the good Man of the Hill, when our heroe departed, sat himself down on the brow, where, though he had a gun in his hand, he with great patience and unconcern had attended the issue.
Jones then stepping without the wood, perceived the old man sitting as we have just described him; he presently exerted his utmost agility, and with surprizing expedition ascended the hill.
The old man advised him to carry the woman to Upton, which, he said, was the nearest town, and there he would be sure of furnishing her with all manner of conveniencies. Jones having received his direction to the place, took his leave of the Man of the Hill, and, desiring him to direct Partridge the same way, returned hastily to the wood.
Our heroe, at his departure to make this enquiry of his friend, had considered, that as the ruffian's hands were tied behind him, he was incapable of executing any wicked purposes on the poor woman. Besides, he knew he should not be beyond the reach of her voice, and could return soon enough to prevent any mischief. He had moreover declared to the villain, that if he attempted the least insult, he would be himself immediately the executioner of vengeance on him. But Jones unluckily forgot, that though the hands of Northerton were tied, his legs were at liberty; nor did he lay the least injunction on the prisoner that he should not make what use of these he pleased. Northerton therefore having given no parole of that kind, thought he might without any breach of honour depart; not being obliged, as he imagined, by any rules, to wait for a formal discharge. He therefore took up his legs, which were at liberty,
436
and walked off through the wood, which favoured his retreat; nor did the woman, whose eyes were perhaps rather turned toward her deliverer, once think of his escape, or give herself any concern or trouble to prevent it.
Jones therefore, at his return, found the woman alone. He would have spent some time in searching for Northerton, but she would not permit him; earnestly entreating that he would accompany her to the town whither they had been directed. "As to the fellow's escape," said she, "it gives me no uneasiness; for philosophy and Christianity both preach up forgiveness of injuries. But for you, sir, I am concerned at the trouble I give you; nay, indeed, my nakedness may well make me ashamed to look you in the face; and if it was not for the sake of your protection, I should wish to go alone."
Jones offered her his coat; but, I know not for what reason, she absolutely refused the most earnest solicitations to accept it. He then begged her to forget both the causes of her confusion. "With regard to the former," says he, "I have done no more than my duty in protecting you; and as for the latter, I will entirely remove it, by walking before you all the way; for I would not have my eyes offend you, and I could not answer for my power of resisting the attractive charms of so much beauty."
Thus our heroe and the redeemed lady walked in the same manner as Orpheus and Eurydice marched heretofore; but though I cannot believe that Jones was designedly tempted by his fair one to look behind him, yet as she frequently wanted his assistance to help her over stiles, and had besides many trips and other accidents, he was often obliged to turn about. However, he had better fortune than what attended poor Orpheus, for he brought his companion, or rather follower, safe into the famous town of Upton.

Chapter U
The arrival of Mr Jones with his lady at the inn; with a very full description of the battle of Upton.
Though the reader, we doubt not, is very eager to know who this lady was, and how she fell into the hands of Mr Northerton, we must beg him to suspend his curiosity for a short time, as we are obliged, for some very good reasons which hereafter perhaps he may guess, to delay his satisfaction a little longer.
Mr Jones and his fair companion no sooner entered the town, than they went directly to that inn which in their eyes presented the fairest appearance to the street. Here Jones, having ordered a servant to show a room above stairs, was ascending, when the dishevelled fair, hastily following, was laid hold on by the master of the house, who cried, "Heyday, where is that beggar wench going? Stay below stairs, I desire you." But Jones at that instant thundered from above, "Let the lady come up," in so authoritative a voice, that the good man instantly withdrew his hands, and the lady made the best of her way to the chamber.
Here Jones wished her joy of her safe arrival, and then departed, in order, as he promised, to send the landlady up with some cloaths. The poor woman thanked him heartily for all his kindness, and said, she hoped she should see him again soon, to thank him a thousand times more. During this short conversation, she covered her white bosom as well as she could possibly with her arms; for Jones could not avoid stealing a sly peep or two, though he took all imaginable care to avoid giving any offence.
Our travellers had happened to take up their residence at a house of exceeding good repute, whither Irish ladies of strict virtue, and many northern lasses of the same predicament, were accustomed to resort in their way to Bath. The landlady therefore would by no means have admitted any conversation of a disreputable kind to pass under her roof. Indeed, so foul and contagious are all such proceedings, that they
438
contaminate the very innocent scenes where they are committed, and give the name of a bad house, or of a house of ill repute, to all those where they are suffered to be carried on.
Not that I would intimate that such strict chastity as was preserved in the temple of Vesta can possibly be maintained at a public inn. My good landlady did not hope for such a blessing, nor would any of the ladies I have spoken of, or indeed any others of the most rigid note, have expected or insisted on any such thing. But to exclude all vulgar concubinage, and to drive all whores in rags from within the walls, is within the power of every one. This my landlady very strictly adhered to, and this her virtuous guests, who did not travel in rags, would very reasonably have expected of her.
Now it required no very blameable degree of suspicion to imagine that Mr Jones and his ragged companion had certain purposes in their intention, which, though tolerated in some Christian countries, connived at in others, and practised in all, are however as expressly forbidden as murder, or any other horrid vice, by that religion which is universally believed in those countries. The landlady, therefore, had no sooner received an intimation of the entrance of the above-said persons than she began to meditate the most expeditious means for their expulsion. In order to this, she had provided herself with a long and deadly instrument, with which, in times of peace, the chambermaid was wont to demolish the labours of the industrious spider. In vulgar phrase, she had taken up the broomstick, and was just about to sally from the kitchen, when Jones accosted her with a demand of a gown and other vestments, to cover the half-naked woman upstairs.
Nothing can be more provoking to the human temper, nor more dangerous to that cardinal virtue, patience, than solicitations of extraordinary offices of kindness on behalf of those very persons with whom we are highly incensed. For this reason Shakespear hath artfully introduced his Desdemona soliciting favours for Cassio of her husband, as the means of inflaming, not only his jealousy, but his rage, to the highest pitch of madness; and we find the unfortunate Moor less able to command his passion on this occasion, than even when he beheld his valued present to his wife in the hands of his supposed rival. In fact, we regard these efforts as insults on our understanding, and to such the pride of man is very difficultly brought to submit.
My landlady, though a very good-tempered woman, had, I suppose, some of this pride in her composition, for Jones had scarce ended his
439
request, when she fell upon him with a certain weapon, which, though it be neither long, nor sharp, nor hard, nor indeed threatens from its appearance with either death or wound, hath been however held in great dread and abhorrence by many wise men一nay, by many brave ones; insomuch, that some who have dared to look into the mouth of a loaded cannon, have not dared to look into a mouth where this weapon was brandished; and rather than run the hazard of its execution, have contented themselves with making a most pitiful and sneaking figure in the eyes of all their acquaintance.
To confess the truth, I am afraid Mr Jones was one of these; for though he was attacked and violently belaboured with the aforesaid weapon, he could not be provoked to make any resistance; but in a most cowardly manner applied, with many entreaties, to his antagonist to desist from pursuing her blows; in plain English, he only begged her with the utmost earnestness to hear him; but before he could obtain his request, my landlord himself entered into the fray, and embraced that side of the cause which seemed to stand very little in need of assistance.
There are a sort of heroes who are supposed to be determined in their chusing or avoiding a conflict by the character and behaviour of the person whom they are to engage. These are said to know their men, and Jones, I believe, knew his woman; for though he had been so submissive to her, he was no sooner attacked by her husband, than he demonstrated an immediate spirit of resentment, and enjoined him silence under a very severe penalty; no less than that, I think, of being converted into fuel for his own fire.
The husband, with great indignation, but with a mixture of pity, answered, "You must pray first to be made able. I believe I am a better man than yourself; ay, every way, that I am;" and presently proceeded to discharge half-a-dozen whores at the lady above stairs, the last of which had scarce issued from his lips, when a swinging blow from the cudgel that Jones carried in his hand assaulted him over the shoulders.
It is a question whether the landlord or the landlady was the most expeditious in returning this blow. My landlord, whose hands were empty, fell to with his fist, and the good wife, uplifting her broom and aiming at the head of Jones, had probably put an immediate end to the fray, and to Jones likewise, had not the descent of this broom been prevented一not by the miraculous intervention of any heathen deity, but by a very natural though fortunate accident, viz., by the arrival of Partridge; who entered the house at that instant (for fear had caused him to run every
440
step from the hill), and who, seeing the danger which threatened his master or companion (which you chuse to call him), prevented so sad a catastrophe, by catching hold of the landlady's arm, as it was brandished aloft in the air.
The landlady soon perceived the impediment which prevented her blow; and being unable to rescue her arm from the hands of Partridge, she let fall the broom; and then leaving Jones to the discipline of her husband, she fell with the utmost fury on that poor fellow, who had already given some intimation of himself, by crying, "Zounds! do you intend to kill my friend?"
Partridge, though not much addicted to battle, would not however stand still when his friend was attacked; nor was he much displeased with that part of the combat which fell to his share; he therefore returned my landlady's blows as soon as he received them: and now the fight was obstinately maintained on all parts, and it seemed doubtful to which side Fortune would incline, when the naked lady, who had listened at the top of the stairs to the dialogue which preceded the engagement, descended suddenly from above, and without weighing the unfair inequality of two to one, fell upon the poor woman who was boxing with Partridge; nor did that great champion desist, but rather redoubled his fury, when he found fresh succours were arrived to his assistance.
Victory must now have fallen to the side of the travellers (for the bravest troops must yield to numbers) had not Susan the chambermaid come luckily to support her mistress. This Susan was as two-handed a wench (according to the phrase) as any in the country, and would, I believe, have beat the famed Thalestris herself, or any of her subject Amazons; for her form was robust and man-like, and every way made for such encounters. As her hands and arms were formed to give blows with great mischief to an enemy, so was her face as well contrived to receive blows without any great injury to herself, her nose being already flat to her face; her lips were so large, that no swelling could be perceived in them, and moreover they were so hard, that a fist could hardly make any impression on them. Lastly, her cheek-bones stood out, as if nature had intended them for two bastions to defend her eyes in those encounters for which she seemed so well calculated, and to which she was most wonderfully well inclined.
This fair creature entering the field of battle, immediately filed to that wing where her mistress maintained so unequal a fight with one of
441
either sex. Here she presently challenged Partridge to single combat. He accepted the challenge, and a most desperate fight began between them.
Now the dogs of war being let loose, began to lick their bloody lips; now Victory, with golden wings, hung hovering in the air; now Fortune, taking her scales from her shelf, began to weigh the fates of Tom Jones, his female companion, and Partridge, against the landlord, his wife, and maid; all which hung in exact balance before her; when a good-natured accident put suddenly an end to the bloody fray, with which half of the combatants had already sufficiently feasted. This accident was the arrival of a coach and four; upon which my landlord and landlady immediately desisted from fighting, and at their entreaty obtained the same favour of their antagonists: but Susan was not so kind to Partridge; for that Amazonian fair having overthrown and bestrid her enemy, was now cuffing him lustily with both her hands, without any regard to his request of a cessation of arms, or to those loud exclamations of murder which he roared forth.
No sooner, however, had Jones quitted the landlord, than he flew to the rescue of his defeated companion, from whom he with much difficulty drew off the enraged chambermaid: but Partridge was not immediately sensible of his deliverance, for he still lay flat on the floor, guarding his face with his hands; nor did he cease roaring till Jones had forced him to look up, and to perceive that the battle was at an end.
The landlord, who had no visible hurt, and the landlady, hiding her well-scratched face with her handkerchief, ran both hastily to the door to attend the coach, from which a young lady and her maid now alighted. These the landlady presently ushered into that room where Mr Jones had at first deposited his fair prize, as it was the best apartment in the house. Hither they were obliged to pass through the field of battle, which they did with the utmost haste, covering their faces with their handkerchiefs, as desirous to avoid the notice of any one. Indeed their caution was quite unnecessary; for the poor unfortunate Helen, the fatal cause of all the bloodshed, was entirely taken up in endeavouring to conceal her own face, and Jones was no less occupied in rescuing Partridge from the fury of Susan; which being happily effected, the poor fellow immediately departed to the pump to wash his face, and to stop that bloody torrent which Susan had plentifully set a-flowing from his nostrils.
442
In which the arrival of a man of war puts a final end to hostilities, and causes the conclusion of a firm and lasting peace between all parties.
A serjeant and a file of musqueteers, with a deserter in their custody, arrived about this time. The serjeant presently enquired for the principal magistrate of the town, and was informed by my landlord, that he himself was vested in that office. He then demanded his billets, together with a mug of beer, and complaining it was cold, spread himself before the kitchen fire.
Mr Jones was at this time comforting the poor distressed lady, who sat down at a table in the kitchen, and leaning her head upon her arm, was bemoaning her misfortunes; but lest my fair readers should be in pain concerning a particular circumstance, I think proper here to acquaint them, that before she had quitted the room above stairs, she had so well covered herself with a pillowbeer which she there found, that her regard to decency was not in the least violated by the presence of so many men as were now in the room.
One of the soldiers now went up to the serjeant, and whispered something in his ear; upon which he stedfastly fixed his eyes on the lady, and having looked at her for near a minute, he came up to her, saying, "I ask pardon, madam; but I am certain I am not deceived; you can be no other person than Captain Waters's lady?"
The poor woman, who in her present distress had very little regarded the face of any person present, no sooner looked at the serjeant than she presently recollected him, and calling him by his name, answered, "That she was indeed the unhappy person he imagined her to be;" but added, "I wonder any one should know me in this disguise." To which the serjeant replied, "He was very much surprized to see her ladyship in such a dress, and was afraid some accident had happened to her."一"An accident hath happened to me, indeed," says she, "and I am highly obliged to this gentleman" (pointing to Jones) "that it was not a fatal one, or that I
443
am now living to mention it."—"Whatever the gentleman hath done," cries the serjeant, "I am sure the captain will make him amends for it; and if I can be of any service, your ladyship may command me, and I shall think myself very happy to have it in my power to serve your ladyship; and so indeed may any one, for I know the captain will well reward them for it."
The landlady, who heard from the stairs all that past between the serjeant and Mrs Waters, came hastily down, and running directly up to her, began to ask pardon for the offences she had committed, begging that all might be imputed to ignorance of her quality: for, "Lud! madam," says she, "how should I have imagined that a lady of your fashion would appear in such a dress? I am sure, madam, if I had once suspected that your ladyship was your ladyship, I would sooner have burnt my tongue out, than have said what I have said; and I hope your ladyship will accept of a gown, till you can get your own cloaths."
"Prithee, woman," says Mrs Waters, "cease your impertinence: how can you imagine I should concern myself about anything which comes from the lips of such low creatures as yourself? But I am surprized at your assurance in thinking, after what is past, that I will condescend to put on any of your dirty things. I would have you know, creature, I have a spirit above that."
Here Jones interfered, and begged Mrs Waters to forgive the landlady, and to accept her gown: "for I must confess," cries he, "our appearance was a little suspicious when first we came in; and I am well assured all this good woman did was, as she professed, out of regard to the reputation of her house."
"Yes, upon my truly was it," says she: "the gentleman speaks very much like a gentleman, and I see very plainly is so; and to be certain the house is well known to be a house of as good reputation as any on the road, and though I say it, is frequented by gentry of the best quality, both Irish and English. I defy anybody to say black is my eye, for that matter. And, as I was saying, if I had known your ladyship to be your ladyship, I would as soon have burnt my fingers as have affronted your ladyship; but truly where gentry come and spend their money, I am not willing that they should be scandalized by a set of poor shabby vermin, that, wherever they go, leave more lice than money behind them; such folks never raise my compassion, for to be certain it is foolish to have any for them; and if our justices did as they ought, they would be all whipt out of the kingdom, for to be certain it is what is most fitting for them. But as
444
for your ladyship, I am heartily sorry your ladyship hath had a misfortune, and if your ladyship will do me the honour to wear my cloaths till you can get some of your ladyship's own, to be certain the best I have is at your ladyship's service."
Whether cold, shame, or the persuasions of Mr Jones prevailed most on Mrs Waters, I will not determine, but she suffered herself to be pacified by this speech of my landlady, and retired with that good woman, in order to apparel herself in a decent manner.
My landlord was likewise beginning his oration to Jones, but was presently interrupted by that generous youth, who shook him heartily by the hand, and assured him of entire forgiveness, saying, "If you are satisfied, my worthy friend, I promise you I am;" and indeed, in one sense, the landlord had the better reason to be satisfied; for he had received a bellyfull of drubbing, whereas Jones had scarce felt a single blow.
Partridge, who had been all this time washing his bloody nose at the pump, returned into the kitchen at the instant when his master and the landlord were shaking hands with each other. As he was of a peaceable disposition, he was pleased with those symptoms of reconciliation; and though his face bore some marks of Susan's fist, and many more of her nails, he rather chose to be contented with his fortune in the last battle than to endeavour at bettering it in another.
The heroic Susan was likewise well contented with her victory, though it had cost her a black eye, which Partridge had given her at the first onset. Between these two, therefore, a league was struck, and those hands which had been the instruments of war became now the mediators of peace.
Matters were thus restored to a perfect calm; at which the serjeant, though it may seem so contrary to the principles of his profession, testified his approbation. "Why now, that's friendly," said he; "d一n me, I hate to see two people bear ill-will to one another after they have had a tussel. The only way when friends quarrel is to see it out fairly in a friendly manner, as a man may call it, either with a fist, or sword, or pistol, according as they like, and then let it be all over; for my own part, d一n me if ever I love my friend better than when I am fighting with him! To bear malice is more like a Frenchman than an Englishman."
He then proposed a libation as a necessary part of the ceremony at all treaties of this kind. Perhaps the reader may here conclude that he was well versed in antient history; but this, though highly probable, as he cited no authority to support the custom, I will not affirm with any
445
confidence. Most likely indeed it is, that he founded his opinion on very good authority, since he confirmed it with many violent oaths.
Jones no sooner heard the proposal than, immediately agreeing with the learned serjeant, he ordered a bowl, or rather a large mug, filled with the liquor used on these occasions, to be brought in, and then began the ceremony himself. He placed his right hand in that of the landlord, and, seizing the bowl with his left, uttered the usual words, and then made his libation. After which, the same was observed by all present. Indeed, there is very little need of being particular in describing the whole form, as it differed so little from those libations of which so much is recorded in antient authors and their modern transcribers. The principal difference lay in two instances; for, first, the present company poured the liquor only down their throats; and, secondly, the serjeant, who officiated as priest, drank the last; but he preserved, I believe, the antient form, in swallowing much the largest draught of the whole company, and in being the only person present who contributed nothing towards the libation besides his good offices in assisting at the performance.
The good people now ranged themselves round the kitchen fire, where good humour seemed to maintain an absolute dominion; and Partridge not only forgot his shameful defeat, but converted hunger into thirst, and soon became extremely facetious. We must however quit this agreeable assembly for a while, and attend Mr Jones to Mrs Waters's apartment, where the dinner which he had bespoke was now on the table. Indeed, it took no long time in preparing, having been all drest three days before, and required nothing more from the cook than to warm it over again.

Chapter U
An apology for all heroes who have good stomachs, with a description of a battle of the amorous kind.
Heroes, notwithstanding the high ideas which, by the means of flatterers, they may entertain of themselves, or the world may conceive of them, have certainly more of mortal than divine about them. However elevated their minds may be, their bodies at least (which is much the major part of most) are liable to the worst infirmities, and subject to the vilest offices of human nature. Among these latter, the act of eating, which hath by several wise men been considered as extremely mean and derogatory from the philosophic dignity, must be in some measure performed by the greatest prince, heroe, or philosopher upon earth; nay, sometimes Nature hath been so frolicsome as to exact of these dignified characters a much more exorbitant share of this office than she hath obliged those of the lowest order to perform.
To say the truth, as no known inhabitant of this globe is really more than man, so none need be ashamed of submitting to what the necessities of man demand; but when those great personages I have just mentioned condescend to aim at confining such low offices to themselves一as when, by hoarding or destroying, they seem desirous to prevent any others from eating一then they surely become very low and despicable.
Now, after this short preface, we think it no disparagement to our her-oe to mention the immoderate ardour with which he laid about him at this season. Indeed, it may be doubted whether Ulysses, who by the way seems to have had the best stomach of all the heroes in that eating poem of the Odyssey, ever made a better meal. Three pounds at least of that flesh which formerly had contributed to the composition of an ox was now honoured with becoming part of the individual Mr Jones.
This particular we thought ourselves obliged to mention, as it may account for our heroe's temporary neglect of his fair companion, who eat but very little, and was indeed employed in considerations of a very
447
different nature, which passed unobserved by Jones, till he had entirely satisfied that appetite which a fast of twenty-four hours had procured him; but his dinner was no sooner ended than his attention to other matters revived; with these matters therefore we shall now proceed to acquaint the reader.
Mr Jones, of whose personal accomplishments we have hitherto said very little, was, in reality, one of the handsomest young fellows in the world. His face, besides being the picture of health, had in it the most apparent marks of sweetness and good-nature. These qualities were indeed so characteristical in his countenance, that, while the spirit and sensibility in his eyes, though they must have been perceived by an accurate observer, might have escaped the notice of the less discerning, so strongly was this good-nature painted in his look, that it was remarked by almost every one who saw him.
It was, perhaps, as much owing to this as to a very fine complexion that his face had a delicacy in it almost inexpressible, and which might have given him an air rather too effeminate, had it not been joined to a most masculine person and mien: which latter had as much in them of the Hercules as the former had of the Adonis. He was besides active, genteel, gay, and good-humoured; and had a flow of animal spirits which enlivened every conversation where he was present.
When the reader hath duly reflected on these many charms which all centered in our heroe, and considers at the same time the fresh obligations which Mrs Waters had to him, it will be a mark more of prudery than candour to entertain a bad opinion of her because she conceived a very good opinion of him.
But, whatever censures may be passed upon her, it is my business to relate matters of fact with veracity. Mrs Waters had, in truth, not only a good opinion of our heroe, but a very great affection for him. To speak out boldly at once, she was in love, according to the present universally-received sense of that phrase, by which love is applied indiscriminately to the desirable objects of all our passions, appetites, and senses, and is understood to be that preference which we give to one kind of food rather than to another.
But though the love to these several objects may possibly be one and the same in all cases, its operations however must be allowed to be different; for, how much soever we may be in love with an excellent surloin of beef, or bottle of Burgundy; with a damask rose, or Cremona fiddle; yet do we never smile, nor ogle, nor dress, nor flatter, nor endeavour by
448
any other arts or tricks to gain the affection of the said beef, &amp;c. Sigh indeed we sometimes may; but it is generally in the absence, not in the presence, of the beloved object. For otherwise we might possibly complain of their ingratitude and deafness, with the same reason as Pasiphae doth of her bull, whom she endeavoured to engage by all the coquetry practised with good success in the drawing-room on the much more sensible as well as tender hearts of the fine gentlemen there.
The contrary happens in that love which operates between persons of the same species, but of different sexes. Here we are no sooner in love than it becomes our principal care to engage the affection of the object beloved. For what other purpose indeed are our youth instructed in all the arts of rendering themselves agreeable? If it was not with a view to this love, I question whether any of those trades which deal in setting off and adorning the human person would procure a livelihood. Nay, those great polishers of our manners, who are by some thought to teach what principally distinguishes us from the brute creation, even dancing-masters themselves, might possibly find no place in society. In short, all the graces which young ladies and young gentlemen too learn from others, and the many improvements which, by the help of a looking-glass, they add of their own, are in reality those very spicula et faces amoris so often mentioned by Ovid; or, as they are sometimes called in our own language, the whole artillery of love.
Now Mrs Waters and our heroe had no sooner sat down together than the former began to play this artillery upon the latter. But here, as we are about to attempt a description hitherto unassayed either in prose or verse, we think proper to invoke the assistance of certain aerial beings, who will, we doubt not, come kindly to our aid on this occasion.
"Say then, ye Graces! you that inhabit the heavenly mansions of Seraphina's countenance; for you are truly divine, are always in her presence, and well know all the arts of charming; say, what were the weapons now used to captivate the heart of Mr Jones."
"First, from two lovely blue eyes, whose bright orbs flashed lightning at their discharge, flew forth two pointed ogles; but, happily for our her-oe, hit only a vast piece of beef which he was then conveying into his plate, and harmless spent their force. The fair warrior perceived their miscarriage, and immediately from her fair bosom drew forth a deadly sigh. A sigh which none could have heard unmoved, and which was sufficient at once to have swept off a dozen beaus; so soft, so sweet, so tender, that the insinuating air must have found its subtle way to the
449
heart of our heroe, had it not luckily been driven from his ears by the coarse bubbling of some bottled ale, which at that time he was pouring forth. Many other weapons did she assay; but the god of eating (if there be any such deity, for I do not confidently assert it) preserved his votary; or perhaps it may not be dignus vindice nodus, and the present security of Jones may be accounted for by natural means; for as love frequently preserves from the attacks of hunger, so may hunger possibly, in some cases, defend us against love.
"The fair one, enraged at her frequent disappointments, determined on a short cessation of arms. Which interval she employed in making ready every engine of amorous warfare for the renewing of the attack when dinner should be over.
"No sooner then was the cloth removed than she again began her operations. First, having planted her right eye sidewise against Mr Jones, she shot from its corner a most penetrating glance; which, though great part of its force was spent before it reached our heroe, did not vent itself absolutely without effect. This the fair one perceiving, hastily withdrew her eyes, and levelled them downwards, as if she was concerned for what she had done; though by this means she designed only to draw him from his guard, and indeed to open his eyes, through which she intended to surprize his heart. And now, gently lifting up those two bright orbs which had already begun to make an impression on poor Jones, she discharged a volley of small charms at once from her whole countenance in a smile. Not a smile of mirth, nor of joy; but a smile of affection, which most ladies have always ready at their command, and which serves them to show at once their good-humour, their pretty dimples, and their white teeth.
"This smile our heroe received full in his eyes, and was immediately staggered with its force. He then began to see the designs of the enemy, and indeed to feel their success. A parley now was set on foot between the parties; during which the artful fair so slily and imperceptibly carried on her attack, that she had almost subdued the heart of our heroe before she again repaired to acts of hostility. To confess the truth, I am afraid Mr Jones maintained a kind of Dutch defence, and treacherously delivered up the garrison, without duly weighing his allegiance to the fair Sophia. In short, no sooner had the amorous parley ended and the lady had unmasked the royal battery, by carelessly letting her handkerchief drop from her neck, than the heart of Mr Jones was entirely taken, and the fair conqueror enjoyed the usual fruits of her victory."

Here the Graces think proper to end their description, and here we think proper to end the chapter.

A friendly conversation in the kitchen, which had a very common, though not very friendly, conclusion.
While our lovers were entertaining themselves in the manner which is partly described in the foregoing chapter, they were likewise furnishing out an entertainment for their good friends in the kitchen. And this in a double sense, by affording them matter for their conversation, and, at the same time, drink to enliven their spirits.
There were now assembled round the kitchen fire, besides my landlord and landlady, who occasionally went backward and forward, Mr Partridge, the serjeant, and the coachman who drove the young lady and her maid.
Partridge having acquainted the company with what he had learnt from the Man of the Hill concerning the situation in which Mrs Waters had been found by Jones, the serjeant proceeded to that part of her history which was known to him. He said she was the wife of Mr Waters, who was a captain in their regiment, and had often been with him at quarters. "Some folks," says he, "used indeed to doubt whether they were lawfully married in a church or no. But, for my part, that's no business of mine: I must own, if I was put to my corporal oath, I believe she is little better than one of us; and I fancy the captain may go to heaven when the sun shines upon a rainy day. But if he does, that is neither here nor there; for he won't want company. And the lady, to give the devil his due, is a very good sort of lady, and loves the cloth, and is always desirous to do strict justice to it; for she hath begged off many a poor soldier, and, by her good-will, would never have any of them punished. But yet, to be sure, Ensign Northerton and she were very well acquainted together at our last quarters; that is the very right and truth of the matter. But the captain he knows nothing about it; and as long as there is enough for him too, what does it signify? He loves her not a bit the worse, and I am certain would run any man through the body that was to abuse her; therefore I won't abuse her, for my part. I only repeat what other folks
452
say; and, to be certain, what everybody says, there must be some truth in."一"Ay, ay, a great deal of truth, I warrant you," cries Partridge; "Veritas odium parit''一"All a parcel of scandalous stuff," answered the mistress of the house. "I am sure, now she is drest, she looks like a very good sort of lady, and she behaves herself like one; for she gave me a guinea for the use of my cloaths."一"A very good lady indeed!" cries the landlord; "and if you had not been a little too hasty, you would not have quarrelled with her as you did at first."一"You need mention that with my truly!" answered she: "if it had not been for your nonsense, nothing had happened. You must be meddling with what did not belong to you, and throw in your fool's discourse."一"Well, well," answered he; "what's past cannot be mended, so there's an end of the matter."一"Yes," cries she, "for this once; but will it be mended ever the more hereafter? This is not the first time I have suffered for your numscull's pate. I wish you would always hold your tongue in the house, and meddle only in matters without doors, which concern you. Don't you remember what happened about seven years ago?"一"Nay, my dear," returned he, "don't rip up old stories. Come, come, all's well, and I am sorry for what I have done." The landlady was going to reply, but was prevented by the peacemaking serjeant, sorely to the displeasure of Partridge, who was a great lover of what is called fun, and a great promoter of those harmless quarrels which tend rather to the production of comical than tragical incidents.
The serjeant asked Partridge whither he and his master were travelling? "None of your magisters," answered Partridge; "I am no man's servant, I assure you; for, though I have had misfortunes in the world, I write gentleman after my name; and, as poor and simple as I may appear now, I have taught grammar-school in my time; sed hei mihi! non sum quod fui."一"No offence, I hope, sir," said the serjeant; "where, then, if I may venture to be so bold, may you and your friend be travel-ling?"一"You have now denominated us right," says Partridge. "Amici sumus. And I promise you my friend is one of the greatest gentlemen in the kingdom" (at which words both landlord and landlady pricked up their ears). "He is the heir of Squire Allworthy."一"What, the squire who doth so much good all over the country?" cries my landlady. "Even he," answered Partridge.一"Then I warrant," says she, "he'll have a swinging great estate hereafter."一"Most certainly," answered Partridge.一"Well," replied the landlady, "I thought the first moment I saw him he looked like a good sort of gentleman; but my husband here, to be sure, is wiser than anybody."一"I own, my dear," cries he, "it was a mistake."一"A
453
mistake, indeed!" answered she; "but when did you ever know me to make such mistakes?"一"But how comes it, sir," cries the landlord, "that such a great gentleman walks about the country afoot?"一"I don't know," returned Partridge; "great gentlemen have humours sometimes. He hath now a dozen horses and servants at Gloucester; and nothing would serve him, but last night, it being very hot weather, he must cool himself with a walk to yon high hill, whither I likewise walked with him to bear him company; but if ever you catch me there again: for I was never so frightened in all my life. We met with the strangest man there."一"I'll be hanged," cries the landlord, "if it was not the Man of the Hill, as they call him; if indeed he be a man; but I know several people who believe it is the devil that lives there."一"Nay, nay, like enough," says Partridge; "and now you put me in the head of it, I verily and sincerely believe it was the devil, though I could not perceive his cloven foot: but perhaps he might have the power given him to hide that, since evil spirits can appear in what shapes they please."一"And pray, sir," says the serjeant, "no offence, I hope; but pray what sort of a gentleman is the devil? For I have heard some of our officers say there is no such person; and that it is only a trick of the parsons, to prevent their being broke; for, if it was publickly known that there was no devil, the parsons would be of no more use than we are in time of peace."一"Those officers," says Partridge, "are very great scholars, I suppose."一"Not much of schollards neither," answered the serjeant; "they have not half your learning, sir, I believe; and, to be sure, I thought there must be a devil, notwithstanding what they said, though one of them was a captain; for methought, thinks I to myself, if there be no devil, how can wicked people be sent to him? and I have read all that upon a book."一"Some of your officers," quoth the landlord, "will find there is a devil, to their shame, I believe. I don't question but he'll pay off some old scores upon my account. Here was one quartered upon me half a year, who had the conscience to take up one of my best beds, though he hardly spent a shilling a day in the house, and suffered his men to roast cabbages at the kitchen fire, because I would not give them a dinner on a Sunday. Every good Christian must desire there should be a devil for the punishment of such wretches."一"Harkee, landlord," said the serjeant, "don't abuse the cloth, for I won't take it."—"D—n the cloth!" answered the landlord, "I have suffered enough by them."一"Bear witness, gentlemen," says the serjeant, "he curses the king, and that's high treason."一"I curse the king! you villain," said the landlord. "Yes, you did," cries the serjeant; "you cursed the cloth, and that's cursing the king. It's all one and the same; for every man who curses the
454
cloth would curse the king if he durst; so for matter o' that, it's all one and the same thing."一"Excuse me there, Mr Serjeant," quoth Partridge, "that's a non sequitur."—"None of your outlandish linguo," answered the serjeant, leaping from his seat; "I will not sit still and hear the cloth abused."一"You mistake me, friend," cries Partridge. "I did not mean to abuse the cloth; I only said your conclusion was a non sequitur. 19 "—"You are another," cries the serjeant," an you come to that. No more a sequitur than yourself. You are a pack of rascals, and I'll prove it; for I will fight the best man of you all for twenty pound." This challenge effectually silenced Partridge, whose stomach for drubbing did not so soon return after the hearty meal which he had lately been treated with; but the coachman, whose bones were less sore, and whose appetite for fighting was somewhat sharper, did not so easily brook the affront, of which he conceived some part at least fell to his share. He started therefore from his seat, and, advancing to the serjeant, swore he looked on himself to be as good a man as any in the army, and offered to box for a guinea. The military man accepted the combat, but refused the wager; upon which both immediately stript and engaged, till the driver of horses was so well mauled by the leader of men, that he was obliged to exhaust his small remainder of breath in begging for quarter.
The young lady was now desirous to depart, and had given orders for her coach to be prepared; but all in vain, for the coachman was disabled from performing his office for that evening. An antient heathen would perhaps have imputed this disability to the god of drink, no less than to the god of war; for, in reality, both the combatants had sacrificed as well to the former deity as to the latter. To speak plainly, they were both dead drunk, nor was Partridge in a much better situation. As for my landlord, drinking was his trade; and the liquor had no more effect on him than it had on any other vessel in his house.
The mistress of the inn, being summoned to attend Mr Jones and his companion at their tea, gave a full relation of the latter part of the foregoing scene; and at the same time expressed great concern for the young lady, "who," she said, "was under the utmost uneasiness at being prevented from pursuing her journey. She is a sweet pretty creature," added she, "and I am certain I have seen her face before. I fancy she is in love, and running away from her friends. Who knows but some young gentleman or other may be expecting her, with a heart as heavy as her own?"
19.This word, which the serjeant unhappily mistook for an affront, is a term in logic, and means that the conclusion does not follow from the premises.
455
Jones fetched a heavy sigh at those words; of which, though Mrs Waters observed it, she took no notice while the landlady continued in the room; but, after the departure of that good woman, she could not forbear giving our heroe certain hints on her suspecting some very dangerous rival in his affections. The aukward behaviour of Mr Jones on this occasion convinced her of the truth, without his giving her a direct answer to any of her questions; but she was not nice enough in her amours to be greatly concerned at the discovery. The beauty of Jones highly charmed her eye; but as she could not see his heart, she gave herself no concern about it. She could feast heartily at the table of love, without reflecting that some other already had been, or hereafter might be, feasted with the same repast. A sentiment which, if it deals but little in refinement, deals, however, much in substance; and is less capricious, and perhaps less ill-natured and selfish, than the desires of those females who can be contented enough to abstain from the possession of their lovers, provided they are sufficiently satisfied that no one else possesses them.

Chapter /
Containing a fuller account of Mrs Waters, and by what means she came into that distressful situation from which she was rescued by Jones.
Though Nature hath by no means mixed up an equal share either of curiosity or vanity in every human composition, there is perhaps no individual to whom she hath not allotted such a proportion of both as requires much arts, and pains too, to subdue and keep under;一a conquest, however, absolutely necessary to every one who would in any degree deserve the characters of wisdom or good breeding.
As Jones, therefore, might very justly be called a well-bred man, he had stifled all that curiosity which the extraordinary manner in which he had found Mrs Waters must be supposed to have occasioned. He had, indeed, at first thrown out some few hints to the lady; but, when he perceived her industriously avoiding any explanation, he was contented to remain in ignorance, the rather as he was not without suspicion that there were some circumstances which must have raised her blushes, had she related the whole truth.
Now since it is possible that some of our readers may not so easily acquiesce under the same ignorance, and as we are very desirous to satisfy them all, we have taken uncommon pains to inform ourselves of the real fact, with the relation of which we shall conclude this book.
This lady, then, had lived some years with one Captain Waters, who was a captain in the same regiment to which Mr Northerton belonged. She past for that gentleman's wife, and went by his name; and yet, as the serjeant said, there were some doubts concerning the reality of their marriage, which we shall not at present take upon us to resolve.
Mrs Waters, I am sorry to say it, had for some time contracted an intimacy with the above-mentioned ensign, which did no great credit to her reputation. That she had a remarkable fondness for that young fellow is most certain; but whether she indulged this to any very criminal
457
lengths is not so extremely clear, unless we will suppose that women never grant every favour to a man but one, without granting him that one also.
The division of the regiment to which Captain Waters belonged had two days preceded the march of that company to which Mr Northerton was the ensign; so that the former had reached Worcester the very day after the unfortunate re-encounter between Jones and Northerton which we have before recorded.
Now, it had been agreed between Mrs Waters and the captain that she would accompany him in his march as far as Worcester, where they were to take their leave of each other, and she was thence to return to Bath, where she was to stay till the end of the winter's campaign against the rebels.
With this agreement Mr Northerton was made acquainted. To say the truth, the lady had made him an assignation at this very place, and promised to stay at Worcester till his division came thither; with what view, and for what purpose, must be left to the reader's divination; for, though we are obliged to relate facts, we are not obliged to do a violence to our nature by any comments to the disadvantage of the loveliest part of the creation.
Northerton no sooner obtained a release from his captivity, as we have seen, than he hasted away to overtake Mrs Waters; which, as he was a very active nimble fellow, he did at the last-mentioned city, some few hours after Captain Waters had left her. At his first arrival he made no scruple of acquainting her with the unfortunate accident; which he made appear very unfortunate indeed, for he totally extracted every particle of what could be called fault, at least in a court of honour, though he left some circumstances which might be questionable in a court of law.
Women, to their glory be it spoken, are more generally capable of that violent and apparently disinterested passion of love, which seeks only the good of its object, than men. Mrs Waters, therefore, was no sooner apprized of the danger to which her lover was exposed, than she lost every consideration besides that of his safety; and this being a matter equally agreeable to the gentleman, it became the immediate subject of debate between them.
After much consultation on this matter, it was at length agreed that the ensign should go across the country to Hereford, whence he might find some conveyance to one of the sea-ports in Wales, and thence might make his escape abroad. In all which expedition Mrs Waters declared she
458
would bear him company; and for which she was able to furnish him with money, a very material article to Mr Northerton, she having then in her pocket three bank-notes to the amount of £90, besides some cash, and a diamond ring of pretty considerable value on her finger. All which she, with the utmost confidence, revealed to this wicked man, little suspecting she should by these means inspire him with a design of robbing her. Now, as they must, by taking horses from Worcester, have furnished any pursuers with the means of hereafter discovering their route, the ensign proposed, and the lady presently agreed, to make their first stage on foot; for which purpose the hardness of the frost was very seasonable.
The main part of the lady's baggage was already at Bath, and she had nothing with her at present besides a very small quantity of linen, which the gallant undertook to carry in his own pockets. All things, therefore, being settled in the evening, they arose early the next morning, and at five o'clock departed from Worcester, it being then above two hours before day, but the moon, which was then at the full, gave them all the light she was capable of affording.
Mrs Waters was not of that delicate race of women who are obliged to the invention of vehicles for the capacity of removing themselves from one place to another, and with whom consequently a coach is reckoned among the necessaries of life. Her limbs were indeed full of strength and agility, and, as her mind was no less animated with spirit, she was perfectly able to keep pace with her nimble lover.
Having travelled on for some miles in a high road, which Northerton said he was informed led to Hereford, they came at the break of day to the side of a large wood, where he suddenly stopped, and, affecting to meditate a moment with himself, expressed some apprehensions from travelling any longer in so public a way. Upon which he easily persuaded his fair companion to strike with him into a path which seemed to lead directly through the wood, and which at length brought them both to the bottom of Mazard Hill.
Whether the execrable scheme which he now attempted to execute was the effect of previous deliberation, or whether it now first came into his head, I cannot determine. But being arrived in this lonely place, where it was very improbable he should meet with any interruption, he suddenly slipped his garter from his leg, and, laying violent hands on the poor woman, endeavoured to perpetrate that dreadful and detestable fact which we have before commemorated, and which the providential appearance of Jones did so fortunately prevent.
459
Happy was it for Mrs Waters that she was not of the weakest order of females; for no sooner did she perceive, by his tying a knot in his garter, and by his declarations, what his hellish intentions were, than she stood stoutly to her defence, and so strongly struggled with her enemy, screaming all the while for assistance, that she delayed the execution of the villain's purpose several minutes, by which means Mr Jones came to her relief at that very instant when her strength failed and she was totally overpowered, and delivered her from the ruffian's hands, with no other loss than that of her cloaths, which were torn from her back, and of the diamond ring, which during the contention either dropped from her finger, or was wrenched from it by Northerton.
Thus, reader, we have given thee the fruits of a very painful enquiry which for thy satisfaction we have made into this matter. And here we have opened to thee a scene of folly as well as villany, which we could scarce have believed a human creature capable of being guilty of, had we not remembered that this fellow was at that time firmly persuaded that he had already committed a murder, and had forfeited his life to the law. As he concluded therefore that his only safety lay in flight, he thought the possessing himself of this poor woman's money and ring would make him amends for the additional burthen he was to lay on his conscience.
And here, reader, we must strictly caution thee that thou dost not take any occasion, from the misbehaviour of such a wretch as this, to reflect on so worthy and honourable a body of men as are the officers of our army in general. Thou wilt be pleased to consider that this fellow, as we have already informed thee, had neither the birth nor education of a gentleman, nor was a proper person to be enrolled among the number of such. If, therefore, his baseness can justly reflect on any besides himself, it must be only on those who gave him his commission.

Chapter 且
Containing instructions very necessary to be perused by modern critics.
Reader, it is impossible we should know what sort of person thou wilt be; for, perhaps, thou may'st be as learned in human nature as Shakespear himself was, and, perhaps, thou may'st be no wiser than some of his editors. Now, lest this latter should be the case, we think proper, before we go any farther together, to give thee a few wholesome admonitions; that thou may'st not as grossly misunderstand and misrepresent us, as some of the said editors have misunderstood and misrepresented their author.
First, then, we warn thee not too hastily to condemn any of the incidents in this our history as impertinent and foreign to our main design, because thou dost not immediately conceive in what manner such incident may conduce to that design. This work may, indeed, be considered as a great creation of our own; and for a little reptile of a critic to presume to find fault with any of its parts, without knowing the manner in which the whole is connected, and before he comes to the final catastrophe, is a most presumptuous absurdity. The allusion and metaphor we have here made use of, we must acknowledge to be infinitely too great for our occasion; but there is, indeed, no other, which is at all adequate to express the difference between an author of the first rate and a critic of the lowest.
Another caution we would give thee, my good reptile, is, that thou dost not find out too near a resemblance between certain characters here introduced; as, for instance, between the landlady who appears in the seventh book and her in the ninth. Thou art to know, friend, that there are certain characteristics in which most individuals of every profession and occupation agree. To be able to preserve these characteristics, and at the same time to diversify their operations, is one talent of a good writer. Again, to mark the nice distinction between two persons actuated by the same vice or folly is another; and, as this last talent is found in very few
462
writers, so is the true discernment of it found in as few readers; though, I believe, the observation of this forms a very principal pleasure in those who are capable of the discovery; every person, for instance, can distinguish between Sir Epicure Mammon and Sir Fopling Flutter; but to note the difference between Sir Fopling Flutter and Sir Courtly Nice requires a more exquisite judgment: for want of which, vulgar spectators of plays very often do great injustice in the theatre; where I have sometimes known a poet in danger of being convicted as a thief, upon much worse evidence than the resemblance of hands hath been held to be in the law. In reality, I apprehend every amorous widow on the stage would run the hazard of being condemned as a servile imitation of Dido, but that happily very few of our play-house critics understand enough of Latin to read Virgil.
In the next place, we must admonish thee, my worthy friend (for, perhaps, thy heart may be better than thy head), not to condemn a character as a bad one, because it is not perfectly a good one. If thou dost delight in these models of perfection, there are books enow written to gratify thy taste; but, as we have not, in the course of our conversation, ever happened to meet with any such person, we have not chosen to introduce any such here. To say the truth, I a little question whether mere man ever arrived at this consummate degree of excellence, as well as whether there hath ever existed a monster bad enough to verify that
----nulla virtute redemptum A vitiis-20
in Juvenal; nor do I, indeed, conceive the good purposes served by inserting characters of such angelic perfection, or such diabolical depravity, in any work of invention; since, from contemplating either, the mind of man is more likely to be overwhelmed with sorrow and shame than to draw any good uses from such patterns; for in the former instance he may be both concerned and ashamed to see a pattern of excellence in his nature, which he may reasonably despair of ever arriving at; and in contemplating the latter he may be no less affected with those uneasy sensations, at seeing the nature of which he is a partaker degraded into so odious and detestable a creature.
In fact, if there be enough of goodness in a character to engage the admiration and affection of a well-disposed mind, though there should appear some of those little blemishes quas humana parum cavit natura, they will raise our compassion rather than our abhorrence. Indeed, nothing can be of more moral use than the imperfections which are seen in
20.Whose vices are not allayed with a single virtue
463
examples of this kind; since such form a kind of surprize, more apt to affect and dwell upon our minds than the faults of very vicious and wicked persons. The foibles and vices of men, in whom there is great mixture of good, become more glaring objects from the virtues which contrast them and shew their deformity; and when we find such vices attended with their evil consequence to our favourite characters, we are not only taught to shun them for our own sake, but to hate them for the mischiefs they have already brought on those we love.
And now, my friend, having given you these few admonitions, we will, if you please, once more set forward with our history.

Chapter
Containing the arrival of an Irish gentleman, with very extraordinary adventures which ensued at the inn.
Now the little trembling hare, which the dread of all her numerous enemies, and chiefly of that cunning, cruel, carnivorous animal, man, had confined all the day to her lurking-place, sports wantonly o'er the lawns; now on some hollow tree the owl, shrill chorister of the night, hoots forth notes which might charm the ears of some modern connoisseurs in music; now, in the imagination of the half-drunk clown, as he staggers through the churchyard, or rather charnelyard, to his home, fear paints the bloody hobgoblin; now thieves and ruffians are awake, and honest watchmen fast asleep; in plain English, it was now midnight; and the company at the inn, as well those who have been already mentioned in this history, as some others who arrived in the evening, were all in bed. Only Susan Chambermaid was now stirring, she being obliged to wash the kitchen before she retired to the arms of the fond expecting hostler.
In this posture were affairs at the inn when a gentleman arrived there post. He immediately alighted from his horse, and, coming up to Susan, enquired of her, in a very abrupt and confused manner, being almost out of breath with eagerness, Whether there was any lady in the house? The hour of night, and the behaviour of the man, who stared very wildly all the time, a little surprized Susan, so that she hesitated before she made any answer; upon which the gentleman, with redoubled eagerness, begged her to give him a true information, saying, He had lost his wife, and was come in pursuit of her. "Upon my shoul," cries he, "I have been near catching her already in two or three places, if I had not found her gone just as I came up with her. If she be in the house, do carry me up in the dark and show her to me; and if she be gone away before me, do tell me which way I shall go after her to meet her, and, upon my shoul, I will make you the richest poor woman in the nation." He then pulled out a handful of guineas, a sight which would have bribed persons of much greater consequence than this poor wench to much worse purposes.
465
Susan, from the account she had received of Mrs Waters, made not the least doubt but that she was the very identical stray whom the right owner pursued. As she concluded, therefore, with great appearance of reason, that she never could get money in an honester way than by restoring a wife to her husband, she made no scruple of assuring the gentleman that the lady he wanted was then in the house; and was presently afterwards prevailed upon (by very liberal promises, and some earnest paid into her hands) to conduct him to the bedchamber of Mrs Waters.
It hath been a custom long established in the polite world, and that upon very solid and substantial reasons, that a husband shall never enter his wife's apartment without first knocking at the door. The many excellent uses of this custom need scarce be hinted to a reader who hath any knowledge of the world; for by this means the lady hath time to adjust herself, or to remove any disagreeable object out of the way; for there are some situations in which nice and delicate women would not be discovered by their husbands.
To say the truth, there are several ceremonies instituted among the polished part of mankind, which, though they may, to coarser judgments, appear as matters of mere form, are found to have much of substance in them, by the more discerning; and lucky would it have been had the custom above mentioned been observed by our gentleman in the present instance. Knock, indeed, he did at the door, but not with one of those gentle raps which is usual on such occasions. On the contrary, when he found the door locked, he flew at it with such violence, that the lock immediately gave way, the door burst open, and he fell headlong into the room.
He had no sooner recovered his legs than forth from the bed, upon his legs likewise, appeared一with shame and sorrow are we obliged to proceed一our heroe himself, who, with a menacing voice, demanded of the gentleman who he was, and what he meant by daring to burst open his chamber in that outrageous manner.
The gentleman at first thought he had committed a mistake, and was going to ask pardon and retreat, when, on a sudden, as the moon shone very bright, he cast his eyes on stays, gowns, petticoats, caps, ribbons, stockings, garters, shoes, clogs, &amp;c., all which lay in a disordered manner on the floor. All these, operating on the natural jealousy of his temper, so enraged him, that he lost all power of speech; and, without returning any answer to Jones, he endeavoured to approach the bed.
466
Jones immediately interposing, a fierce contention arose, which soon proceeded to blows on both sides. And now Mrs Waters (for we must confess she was in the same bed), being, I suppose, awakened from her sleep, and seeing two men fighting in her bedchamber, began to scream in the most violent manner, crying out murder! robbery! and more frequently rape! which last, some, perhaps, may wonder she should mention, who do not consider that these words of exclamation are used by ladies in a fright, as fa, la, la, ra, da, &amp;c., are in music, only as the vehicles of sound, and without any fixed ideas.
Next to the lady's chamber was deposited the body of an Irish gentleman who arrived too late at the inn to have been mentioned before. This gentleman was one of those whom the Irish call a calabalaro, or cavalier. He was a younger brother of a good family, and, having no fortune at home, was obliged to look abroad in order to get one; for which purpose he was proceeding to the Bath, to try his luck with cards and the women.
This young fellow lay in bed reading one of Mrs Behn's novels; for he had been instructed by a friend that he would find no more effectual method of recommending himself to the ladies than the improving his understanding, and filling his mind with good literature. He no sooner, therefore, heard the violent uproar in the next room, than he leapt from his bolster, and, taking his sword in one hand, and the candle which burnt by him in the other, he went directly to Mrs Waters's chamber.
If the sight of another man in his shirt at first added some shock to the decency of the lady, it made her presently amends by considerably abating her fears; for no sooner had the calabalaro entered the room than he cried out, "Mr Fitzpatrick, what the devil is the maning of this?" Upon which the other immediately answered, "O, Mr Maclachlan! I am rejoiced you are here.一This villain hath debauched my wife, and is got into bed with her."一"What wife?" cries Maclachlan; "do not I know Mrs Fitzpatrick very well, and don't I see that the lady, whom the gentleman who stands here in his shirt is lying in bed with, is none of her?"
Fitzpatrick, now perceiving, as well by the glimpse he had of the lady, as by her voice, which might have been distinguished at a greater distance than he now stood from her, that he had made a very unfortunate mistake, began to ask many pardons of the lady; and then, turning to Jones, he said, "I would have you take notice I do not ask your pardon, for you have bate me; for which I am resolved to have your blood in the morning."
467
Jones treated this menace with much contempt; and Mr Maclachlan answered, "Indeed, Mr Fitzpatrick, you may be ashamed of your own self, to disturb people at this time of night; if all the people in the inn were not asleep, you would have awakened them as you have me. The gentleman has served you very rightly. Upon my conscience, though I have no wife, if you had treated her so, I would have cut your throat."
Jones was so confounded with his fears for his lady's reputation, that he knew neither what to say or do; but the invention of women is, as hath been observed, much readier than that of men. She recollected that there was a communication between her chamber and that of Mr Jones; relying, therefore, on his honour and her own assurance, she answered, "I know not what you mean, villains! I am wife to none of you. Help! Rape! Murder! Rape!"一And now, the landlady coming into the room, Mrs Waters fell upon her with the utmost virulence, saying, "She thought herself in a sober inn, and not in a bawdy-house; but that a set of villains had broke into her room, with an intent upon her honour, if not upon her life; and both, she said, were equally dear to her."
The landlady now began to roar as loudly as the poor woman in bed had done before. She cried, "She was undone, and that the reputation of her house, which was never blown upon before, was utterly destroyed." Then, turning to the men, she cried, "What, in the devil's name, is the reason of all this disturbance in the lady's room?" Fitzpatrick, hanging down his head, repeated, "That he had committed a mistake, for which he heartily asked pardon," and then retired with his countryman. Jones, who was too ingenious to have missed the hint given him by his fair one, boldly asserted, "That he had run to her assistance upon hearing the door broke open, with what design he could not conceive, unless of robbing the lady; which, if they intended, he said, he had the good fortune to prevent." "I never had a robbery committed in my house since I have kept it," cries the landlady; "I would have you to know, sir, I harbour no highwaymen here; I scorn the word, thof I say it. None but honest, good gentlefolks, are welcome to my house; and, I thank good luck, I have always had enow of such customers; indeed as many as I could entertain. Here hath been my lord一," and then she repeated over a catalogue of names and titles, many of which we might, perhaps, be guilty of a breach of privilege by inserting.
Jones, after much patience, at length interrupted her, by making an apology to Mrs Waters, for having appeared before her in his shirt, assuring her "That nothing but a concern for her safety could have prevailed on him to do it." The reader may inform himself of her answer,
468
and, indeed, of her whole behaviour to the end of the scene, by considering the situation which she affected, it being that of a modest lady, who was awakened out of her sleep by three strange men in her chamber. This was the part which she undertook to perform; and, indeed, she executed it so well, that none of our theatrical actresses could exceed her, in any of their performances, either on or off the stage.
And hence, I think, we may very fairly draw an argument, to prove how extremely natural virtue is to the fair sex; for, though there is not, perhaps, one in ten thousand who is capable of making a good actress, and even among these we rarely see two who are equally able to personate the same character, yet this of virtue they can all admirably well put on; and as well those individuals who have it not, as those who possess it, can all act it to the utmost degree of perfection.
When the men were all departed, Mrs Waters, recovering from her fear, recovered likewise from her anger, and spoke in much gentler accents to the landlady, who did not so readily quit her concern for the reputation of the house, in favour of which she began again to number the many great persons who had slept under her roof; but the lady stopt her short, and having absolutely acquitted her of having had any share in the past disturbance, begged to be left to her repose, which, she said, she hoped to enjoy unmolested during the remainder of the night. Upon which the landlady, after much civility and many courtsies, took her leave.

Chapter U
A dialogue between the landlady and Susan the chamber-maid, proper to be read by all inn-keepers and their servants; with the arrival, and affable behaviour of a beautiful young lady; which may teach persons of condition how they may acquire the love of the whole world.
The landlady, remembering that Susan had been the only person out of bed when the door was burst open, resorted presently to her, to enquire into the first occasion of the disturbance, as well as who the strange gentleman was, and when and how he arrived.
Susan related the whole story which the reader knows already, varying the truth only in some circumstances, as she saw convenient, and totally concealing the money which she had received. But whereas her mistress had, in the preface to her enquiry, spoken much in compassion for the fright which the lady had been in concerning any intended depredations on her virtue, Susan could not help endeavouring to quiet the concern which her mistress seemed to be under on that account, by swearing heartily she saw Jones leap out from her bed.
The landlady fell into a violent rage at these words. "A likely story, truly," cried she, "that a woman should cry out, and endeavour to expose herself, if that was the case! I desire to know what better proof any lady can give of her virtue than her crying out, which, I believe, twenty people can witness for her she did? I beg, madam, you would spread no such scandal of any of my guests; for it will not only reflect on them, but upon the house; and I am sure no vagabonds, nor wicked beggarly people, come here."
"Well," says Susan, "then I must not believe my own eyes." "No, indeed, must you not always," answered her mistress; "I would not have believed my own eyes against such good gentlefolks. I have not had a better supper ordered this half-year than they ordered last night; and so easy and good-humoured were they, that they found no fault with my Worcestershire perry, which I sold them for champagne; and to be sure it
470
is as well tasted and as wholesome as the best champagne in the kingdom, otherwise I would scorn to give it 'em; and they drank me two bottles. No, no, I will never believe any harm of such sober good sort of people."
Susan being thus silenced, her mistress proceeded to other matters. "And so you tell me," continued she, "that the strange gentleman came post, and there is a footman without with the horses; why, then, he is certainly some of your great gentlefolks too. Why did not you ask him whether he'd have any supper? I think he is in the other gentleman's room; go up and ask whether he called. Perhaps he'll order something when he finds anybody stirring in the house to dress it. Now don't commit any of your usual blunders, by telling him the fire's out, and the fowls alive. And if he should order mutton, don't blab out that we have none. The butcher, I know, killed a sheep just before I went to bed, and he never refuses to cut it up warm when I desire it. Go, remember there's all sorts of mutton and fowls; go, open the door with, Gentlemen, d'ye call? and if they say nothing, ask what his honour will be pleased to have for supper? Don't forget his honour. Go; if you don't mind all these matters better, you'll never come to anything."
Susan departed, and soon returned with an account that the two gentlemen were got both into the same bed. "Two gentlemen," says the landlady, "in the same bed! that's impossible; they are two arrant scrubs, I warrant them; and I believe young Squire Allworthy guessed right, that the fellow intended to rob her ladyship; for, if he had broke open the lady's door with any of the wicked designs of a gentleman, he would never have sneaked away to another room to save the expense of a supper and a bed to himself. They are certainly thieves, and their searching after a wife is nothing but a pretence."
In these censures my landlady did Mr Fitzpatrick great injustice; for he was really born a gentleman, though not worth a groat; and though, perhaps, he had some few blemishes in his heart as well as in his head, yet being a sneaking or a niggardly fellow was not one of them. In reality, he was so generous a man, that, whereas he had received a very handsome fortune with his wife, he had now spent every penny of it, except some little pittance which was settled upon her; and, in order to possess himself of this, he had used her with such cruelty, that, together with his jealousy, which was of the bitterest kind, it had forced the poor woman to run away from him.
471
This gentleman then being well tired with his long journey from Chester in one day, with which, and some good dry blows he had received in the scuffle, his bones were so sore, that, added to the soreness of his mind, it had quite deprived him of any appetite for eating. And being now so violently disappointed in the woman whom, at the maid's instance, he had mistaken for his wife, it never once entered into his head that she might nevertheless be in the house, though he had erred in the first person he had attacked. He therefore yielded to the dissuasions of his friend from searching any farther after her that night, and accepted the kind offer of part of his bed.
The footman and post-boy were in a different disposition. They were more ready to order than the landlady was to provide; however, after being pretty well satisfied by them of the real truth of the case, and that Mr Fitzpatrick was no thief, she was at length prevailed on to set some cold meat before them, which they were devouring with great greediness, when Partridge came into the kitchen. He had been first awaked by the hurry which we have before seen; and while he was endeavouring to compose himself again on his pillow, a screech-owl had given him such a serenade at his window, that he leapt in a most horrible affright from his bed, and, huddling on his cloaths with great expedition, ran down to the protection of the company, whom he heard talking below in the kitchen.
His arrival detained my landlady from returning to her rest; for she was just about to leave the other two guests to the care of Susan; but the friend of young Squire Allworthy was not to be so neglected, especially as he called for a pint of wine to be mulled. She immediately obeyed, by putting the same quantity of perry to the fire; for this readily answered to the name of every kind of wine.
The Irish footman was retired to bed, and the post-boy was going to follow; but Partridge invited him to stay and partake of his wine, which the lad very thankfully accepted. The schoolmaster was indeed afraid to return to bed by himself; and as he did not know how soon he might lose the company of my landlady, he was resolved to secure that of the boy, in whose presence he apprehended no danger from the devil or any of his adherents.
And now arrived another post-boy at the gate; upon which Susan, being ordered out, returned, introducing two young women in riding habits, one of which was so very richly laced, that Partridge and the post-boy instantly started from their chairs, and my landlady fell to her courtsies, and her ladyships, with great eagerness.
472
The lady in the rich habit said, with a smile of great condescension, "If you will give me leave, madam, I will warm myself a few minutes at your kitchen fire, for it is really very cold; but I must insist on disturbing no one from his seat." This was spoken on account of Partridge, who had retreated to the other end of the room, struck with the utmost awe and astonishment at the splendor of the lady's dress. Indeed, she had a much better title to respect than this; for she was one of the most beautiful creatures in the world.
The lady earnestly desired Partridge to return to his seat; but could not prevail. She then pulled off her gloves, and displayed to the fire two hands, which had every property of snow in them, except that of melting. Her companion, who was indeed her maid, likewise pulled off her gloves, and discovered what bore an exact resemblance, in cold and colour, to a piece of frozen beef.
"I wish, madam," quoth the latter, "your ladyship would not think of going any farther to-night. I am terribly afraid your ladyship will not be able to bear the fatigue."
"Why sure," cries the landlady, "her ladyship's honour can never intend it. O, bless me! farther to-night, indeed! let me beseech your ladyship not to think on't---But, to be sure, your ladyship can't. What will
your honour be pleased to have for supper? I have mutton of all kinds, and some nice chicken."
"I think, madam," said the lady, "it would be rather breakfast than supper; but I can't eat anything; and, if I stay, shall only lie down for an hour or two. However, if you please, madam, you may get me a little sack whey, made very small and thin."
"Yes, madam," cries the mistress of the house, "I have some excellent white wine."一"You have no sack, then?" says the lady. "Yes, an't please your honour, I have; I may challenge the country for that一but let me beg your ladyship to eat something."
"Upon my word, I can't eat a morsel," answered the lady; "and I shall be much obliged to you if you will please to get my apartment ready as soon as possible; for I am resolved to be on horseback again in three hours."
"Why, Susan," cries the landlady, "is there a fire lit yet in the Wildgoose? I am sorry, madam, all my best rooms are full. Several people of the first quality are now in bed. Here's a great young squire, and many other great gentlefolks of quality." Susan answered, "That the Irish gentlemen were got into the Wild-goose."
473
"Was ever anything like it?" says the mistress; "why the devil would you not keep some of the best rooms for the quality, when you know scarce a day passes without some calling here?----If they be gentlemen,
I am certain, when they know it is for her ladyship, they will get up again."
"Not upon my account," says the lady; "I will have no person disturbed for me. If you have a room that is commonly decent, it will serve me very well, though it be never so plain. I beg, madam, you will not give yourself so much trouble on my account." "O, madam!" cries the other, "I have several very good rooms for that matter, but none good enough for your honour's ladyship. However, as you are so condescending to take up with the best I have, do, Susan, get a fire in the Rose this minute. Will your ladyship be pleased to go up now, or stay till the fire is lighted?" "I think I have sufficiently warmed myself," answered the lady; "so, if you please, I will go now; I am afraid I have kept people, and particularly that gentleman (meaning Partridge), too long in the cold already. Indeed, I cannot bear to think of keeping any person from the fire this dreadful weather."一She then departed with her maid, the landlady marching with two lighted candles before her.
When that good woman returned, the conversation in the kitchen was all upon the charms of the young lady. There is indeed in perfect beauty a power which none almost can withstand; for my landlady, though she was not pleased at the negative given to the supper, declared she had never seen so lovely a creature. Partridge ran out into the most extravagant encomiums on her face, though he could not refrain from paying some compliments to the gold lace on her habit; the post-boy sung forth the praises of her goodness, which were likewise echoed by the other post-boy, who was now come in. "She's a true good lady, I warrant her," says he; "for she hath mercy upon dumb creatures; for she asked me every now and tan upon the journey, if I did not think she should hurt the horses by riding too fast? and when she came in she charged me to give them as much corn as ever they would eat."
Such charms are there in affability, and so sure is it to attract the praises of all kinds of people. It may indeed be compared to the celebrated Mrs Hussey. 21 It is equally sure to set off every female perfection to the highest advantage, and to palliate and conceal every defect.

Containing infallible nostrums for procuring universal disesteem and hatred.
The lady had no sooner laid herself on her pillow than the waiting-woman returned to the kitchen to regale with some of those dainties which her mistress had refused.
The company, at her entrance, shewed her the same respect which they had before paid to her mistress, by rising; but she forgot to imitate her, by desiring them to sit down again. Indeed, it was scarce possible they should have done so, for she placed her chair in such a posture as to occupy almost the whole fire. She then ordered a chicken to be broiled that instant, declaring, if it was not ready in a quarter of an hour, she would not stay for it. Now, though the said chicken was then at roost in the stable, and required the several ceremonies of catching, killing, and picking, before it was brought to the gridiron, my landlady would nevertheless have undertaken to do all within the time; but the guest, being unfortunately admitted behind the scenes, must have been witness to the fourberie; the poor woman was therefore obliged to confess that she had none in the house; "but, madam," said she, "I can get any kind of mutton in an instant from the butcher's."
"Do you think, then," answered the waiting-gentlewoman, "that I have the stomach of a horse, to eat mutton at this time of night? Sure you people that keep inns imagine your betters are like yourselves. Indeed, I expected to get nothing at this wretched place. I wonder my lady would stop at it. I suppose none but tradesmen and grasiers ever call here." The landlady fired at this indignity offered to her house; however, she suppressed her temper, and contented herself with saying, "Very good quality frequented it, she thanked heaven!" "Don't tell me," cries the other, "of quality! I believe I know more of people of quality than such as you.一But, prithee, without troubling me with any of your impertinence, do tell me what I can have for supper; for, though I cannot eat horseflesh, I am really hungry." "Why, truly, madam," answered the landlady,
476
"you could not take me again at such a disadvantage; for I must confess I have nothing in the house, unless a cold piece of beef, which indeed a gentleman's footman and the post-boy have almost cleared to the bone." "Woman," said Mrs Abigail (so for shortness we will call her), "I entreat you not to make me sick. If I had fasted a month, I could not eat what had been touched by the fingers of such fellows. Is there nothing neat or decent to be had in this horrid place?" "What think you of some eggs and bacon, madam?" said the landlady. "Are your eggs new laid? are you certain they were laid to-day? and let me have the bacon cut very nice and thin; for I can't endure anything that's gross.一Prithee try if you can do a little tolerably for once, and don't think you have a farmer's wife, or some of those creatures, in the house."一The landlady began then to handle her knife; but the other stopt her, saying, "Good woman, I must insist upon your first washing your hands; for I am extremely nice, and have been always used from my cradle to have everything in the most elegant manner."
The landlady, who governed herself with much difficulty, began now the necessary preparations; for as to Susan, she was utterly rejected, and with such disdain, that the poor wench was as hard put to it to restrain her hands from violence as her mistress had been to hold her tongue. This indeed Susan did not entirely; for, though she literally kept it within her teeth, yet there it muttered many "marry-come-ups, as good flesh and blood as yourself;" with other such indignant phrases.
While the supper was preparing, Mrs Abigail began to lament she had not ordered a fire in the parlour; but, she said, that was now too late. "However," said she, "I have novelty to recommend a kitchen; for I do not believe I ever eat in one before." Then, turning to the post-boys, she asked them, "Why they were not in the stable with their horses? If I must eat my hard fare here, madam," cries she to the landlady, "I beg the kitchen may be kept clear, that I may not be surrounded with all the blackguards in town: as for you, sir," says she to Partridge, "you look somewhat like a gentleman, and may sit still if you please; I don't desire to disturb anybody but mob."
"Yes, yes, madam," cries Partridge, "I am a gentleman, I do assure you, and I am not so easily to be disturbed. Non semper vox casualis est verbo nominativus." This Latin she took to be some affront, and answered, "You may be a gentleman, sir; but you don't show yourself as one to talk Latin to a woman." Partridge made a gentle reply, and concluded with more Latin; upon which she tossed up her nose, and contented herself by abusing him with the name of a great scholar.
477
The supper being now on the table, Mrs Abigail eat very heartily for so delicate a person; and, while a second course of the same was by her order preparing, she said, "And so, madam, you tell me your house is frequented by people of great quality?"
The landlady answered in the affirmative, saying, "There were a great many very good quality and gentlefolks in it now. There's young Squire Allworthy, as that gentleman there knows."
"And pray who is this young gentleman of quality, this young Squire Allworthy?" said Abigail.
"Who should he be," answered Partridge, "but the son and heir of the great Squire Allworthy, of Somersetshire!"
"Upon my word," said she, "you tell me strange news; for I know Mr Allworthy of Somersetshire very well, and I know he hath no son alive."
The landlady pricked up her ears at this, and Partridge looked a little confounded. However, after a short hesitation, he answered, "Indeed, madam, it is true, everybody doth not know him to be Squire Allworthy's son; for he was never married to his mother; but his son he certainly is, and will be his heir too, as certainly as his name is Jones." At that word, Abigail let drop the bacon which she was conveying to her mouth, and cried out, "You surprize me, sir! Is it possible Mr Jones should be now in the house?" "Quare non?" answered Partridge, "it is possible, and it is certain."
Abigail now made haste to finish the remainder of her meal, and then repaired back to her mistress, when the conversation passed which may be read in the next chapter.

Chapter U
Showing who the amiable lady, and her unamiable maid, were.
As in the month of June, the damask rose, which chance hath planted among the lilies, with their candid hue mixes his vermilion; or as some playsome heifer in the pleasant month of May diffuses her odoriferous breath over the flowery meadows; or as, in the blooming month of April, the gentle, constant dove, perched on some fair bough, sits meditating on her mate; so, looking a hundred charms and breathing as many sweets, her thoughts being fixed on her Tommy, with a heart as good and innocent as her face was beautiful, Sophia (for it was she herself) lay reclining her lovely head on her hand, when her maid entered the room, and, running directly to the bed, cried, "Madam一madam一who doth your ladyship think is in the house?" Sophia, starting up, cried, "I hope my father hath not overtaken us." "No, madam, it is one worth a hundred fathers; Mr Jones himself is here at this very instant." "Mr Jones!" says Sophia, "it is impossible! I cannot be so fortunate." Her maid averred the fact, and was presently detached by her mistress to order him to be called; for she said she was resolved to see him immediately.
Mrs Honour had no sooner left the kitchen in the manner we have before seen than the landlady fell severely upon her. The poor woman had indeed been loading her heart with foul language for some time, and now it scoured out of her mouth, as filth doth from a mud-cart, when the board which confines it is removed. Partridge likewise shovelled in his share of calumny, and (what may surprize the reader) not only bespattered the maid, but attempted to sully the lily-white character of Sophia herself. "Never a barrel the better herring," cries he, "Noscitur a socio, is a true saying. It must be confessed, indeed, that the lady in the fine garments is the civiller of the two; but I warrant neither of them are a bit better than they should be. A couple of Bath trulls, I'll answer for them; your quality don't ride about at this time o' night without servants." "Sbodlikins, and that's true," cries the landlady, "you have certainly hit
479
upon the very matter; for quality don't come into a house without bespeaking a supper, whether they eat or no."
While they were thus discoursing, Mrs Honour returned and discharged her commission, by bidding the landlady immediately wake Mr Jones, and tell him a lady wanted to speak with him. The landlady referred her to Partridge, saying, "he was the squire's friend: but, for her part, she never called men-folks, especially gentlemen," and then walked sullenly out of the kitchen. Honour applied herself to Partridge; but he refused, "for my friend," cries he, "went to bed very late, and he would be very angry to be disturbed so soon." Mrs Honour insisted still to have him called, saying, "she was sure, instead of being angry, that he would be to the highest degree delighted when he knew the occasion." "Another time, perhaps, he might," cries Partridge; "but non omnia possumus omnes. One woman is enough at once for a reasonable man." "What do you mean by one woman, fellow?" cries Honour. "None of your fellow," answered Partridge. He then proceeded to inform her plainly that Jones was in bed with a wench, and made use of an expression too indelicate to be here inserted; which so enraged Mrs Honour, that she called him jackanapes, and returned in a violent hurry to her mistress, whom she acquainted with the success of her errand, and with the account she had received; which, if possible, she exaggerated, being as angry with Jones as if he had pronounced all the words that came from the mouth of Partridge. She discharged a torrent of abuse on the master, and advised her mistress to quit all thoughts of a man who had never shown himself deserving of her. She then ripped up the story of Molly Seagrim, and gave the most malicious turn to his formerly quitting Sophia herself; which, I must confess, the present incident not a little countenanced.
The spirits of Sophia were too much dissipated by concern to enable her to stop the torrent of her maid. At last, however, she interrupted her, saying, "I never can believe this; some villain hath belied him. You say you had it from his friend; but surely it is not the office of a friend to betray such secrets." "I suppose," cries Honour, "the fellow is his pimp; for I never saw so ill-looked a villain. Besides, such profligate rakes as Mr Jones are never ashamed of these matters."
To say the truth, this behaviour of Partridge was a little inexcusable; but he had not slept off the effect of the dose which he swallowed the evening before; which had, in the morning, received the addition of above a pint of wine, or indeed rather of malt spirits; for the perry was by no means pure. Now, that part of his head which Nature designed for the reservoir of drink being very shallow, a small quantity of liquor
480
overflowed it, and opened the sluices of his heart; so that all the secrets there deposited run out. These sluices were indeed, naturally, very ill-secured. To give the best-natured turn we can to his disposition, he was a very honest man; for, as he was the most inquisitive of mortals, and eternally prying into the secrets of others, so he very faithfully paid them by communicating, in return, everything within his knowledge.
While Sophia, tormented with anxiety, knew not what to believe, nor what resolution to take, Susan arrived with the sack-whey. Mrs Honour immediately advised her mistress, in a whisper, to pump this wench, who probably could inform her of the truth. Sophia approved it, and began as follows: "Come hither, child; now answer me truly what I am going to ask you, and I promise you I will very well reward you. Is there a young gentleman in this house, a handsome young gentleman, that----." Here Sophia blushed and was confounded. "A young gentle-
man," cries Honour, "that came hither in company with that saucy rascal who is now in the kitchen?" Susan answered, "There was."一"Do you know anything of any lady?" continues Sophia, "any lady? I don't ask you whether she is handsome or no; perhaps she is not; that's nothing to the purpose; but do you know of any lady?" "La, madam," cries Honour, "you will make a very bad examiner. Hark'ee, child," says she, "is not that very young gentleman now in bed with some nasty trull or other?" Here Susan smiled, and was silent. "Answer the question, child," says Sophia, "and here's a guinea for you."一"A guinea! madam," cries Susan; "la, what's a guinea? If my mistress should know it I shall certainly lose my place that very instant." "Here's another for you," says Sophia, "and I promise you faithfully your mistress shall never know it." Susan, after a very short hesitation, took the money, and told the whole story, concluding with saying, "If you have any great curiosity, madam, I can steal softly into his room, and see whether he be in his own bed or no." She accordingly did this by Sophia's desire, and returned with an answer in the negative.
Sophia now trembled and turned pale. Mrs Honour begged her to be comforted, and not to think any more of so worthless a fellow. "Why there," says Susan, "I hope, madam, your ladyship won't be offended; but pray, madam, is not your ladyship's name Madam Sophia Western?" "How is it possible you should know me?" answered Sophia. "Why that man, that the gentlewoman spoke of, who is in the kitchen, told about you last night. But I hope your ladyship is not angry with me." "Indeed, child," said she, "I am not; pray tell me all, and I promise you I'll reward you." "Why, madam," continued Susan, "that man told us all in the
481
kitchen that Madam Sophia Western—indeed I don't know how to bring it out."一Here she stopt, till, having received encouragement from Sophia, and being vehemently pressed by Mrs Honour, she proceeded thus:一"He told us, madam, though to be sure it is all a lie, that your ladyship was dying for love of the young squire, and that he was going to the wars to get rid of you. I thought to myself then he was a falsehearted wretch; but, now, to see such a fine, rich, beautiful lady as you be, forsaken for such an ordinary woman; for to be sure so she is, and another man's wife into the bargain. It is such a strange unnatural thing, in a manner."
Sophia gave her a third guinea, and, telling her she would certainly be her friend if she mentioned nothing of what had passed, nor informed any one who she was, dismissed the girl, with orders to the post-boy to get the horses ready immediately.
Being now left alone with her maid, she told her trusty waiting-woman, "That she never was more easy than at present. I am now convinced," said she, "he is not only a villain, but a low despicable wretch. I can forgive all rather than his exposing my name in so barbarous a manner. That renders him the object of my contempt. Yes, Honour, I am now easy; I am indeed; I am very easy;" and then she burst into a violent flood of tears.
After a short interval spent by Sophia, chiefly in crying, and assuring her maid that she was perfectly easy, Susan arrived with an account that the horses were ready, when a very extraordinary thought suggested itself to our young heroine, by which Mr Jones would be acquainted with her having been at the inn, in a way which, if any sparks of affection for her remained in him, would be at least some punishment for his faults.
The reader will be pleased to remember a little muff, which hath had the honour of being more than once remembered already in this history. This muff, ever since the departure of Mr Jones, had been the constant companion of Sophia by day, and her bedfellow by night; and this muff she had at this very instant upon her arm; whence she took it off with great indignation, and, having writ her name with her pencil upon a piece of paper which she pinned to it, she bribed the maid to convey it into the empty bed of Mr Jones, in which, if he did not find it, she charged her to take some method of conveying it before his eyes in the morning.
Then, having paid for what Mrs Honour had eaten, in which bill was included an account for what she herself might have eaten, she mounted
482
her horse, and, once more assuring her companion that she was perfectly easy, continued her journey.
483

Containing, among other things, the ingenuity of Partridge, the madness of Jones, and the folly of Fitzpatrick.
It was now past five in the morning, and other company began to rise and come to the kitchen, among whom were the serjeant and the coachman, who, being thoroughly reconciled, made a libation, or, in the English phrase, drank a hearty cup together.
In this drinking nothing more remarkable happened than the behaviour of Partridge, who, when the serjeant drank a health to King George, repeated only the word King; nor could he be brought to utter more; for though he was going to fight against his own cause, yet he could not be prevailed upon to drink against it.
Mr Jones, being now returned to his own bed (but from whence he returned we must beg to be excused from relating), summoned Partridge from this agreeable company, who, after a ceremonious preface, having obtained leave to offer his advice, delivered himself as follows:一
"It is, sir, an old saying, and a true one, that a wise man may sometimes learn counsel from a fool; I wish, therefore, I might be so bold as to offer you my advice, which is to return home again, and leave these hor-rida bella, these bloody wars, to fellows who are contented to swallow gunpowder, because they have nothing else to eat. Now, everybody knows your honour wants for nothing at home; when that's the case, why should any man travel abroad?"
"Partridge," cries Jones, "thou art certainly a coward; I wish, therefore, thou wouldst return home thyself, and trouble me no more."
"I ask your honour's pardon," cries Partridge; "I spoke on your account more than my own; for as to me, Heaven knows my circumstances are bad enough, and I am so far from being afraid, that I value a pistol, or a blunderbuss, or any such thing, no more than a pop-gun. Every man must die once, and what signifies the manner how? besides, perhaps I may come off with the loss only of an arm or a leg. I assure you, sir, I
484
was never less afraid in my life; and so, if your honour is resolved to go on, I am resolved to follow you. But, in that case, I wish I might give my opinion. To be sure, it is a scandalous way of travelling, for a great gentleman like you to walk afoot. Now here are two or three good horses in the stable, which the landlord will certainly make no scruple of trusting you with; but, if he should, I can easily contrive to take them; and, let the worst come to the worst, the king would certainly pardon you, as you are going to fight in his cause."
Now, as the honesty of Partridge was equal to his understanding, and both dealt only in small matters, he would never have attempted a roguery of this kind, had he not imagined it altogether safe; for he was one of those who have more consideration of the gallows than of the fitness of things; but, in reality, he thought he might have committed this felony without any danger; for, besides that he doubted not but the name of Mr Allworthy would sufficiently quiet the landlord, he conceived they should be altogether safe, whatever turn affairs might take; as Jones, he imagined, would have friends enough on one side, and as his friends would as well secure him on the other.
When Mr Jones found that Partridge was in earnest in this proposal, he very severely rebuked him, and that in such bitter terms, that the other attempted to laugh it off, and presently turned the discourse to other matters; saying, he believed they were then in a bawdy house, and that he had with much ado prevented two wenches from disturbing his honour in the middle of the night. "Heyday!" says he, "I believe they got into your chamber whether I would or no; for here lies the muff of one of them on the ground." Indeed, as Jones returned to his bed in the dark, he had never perceived the muff on the quilt, and, in leaping into his bed, he had tumbled it on the floor. This Partridge now took up, and was going to put into his pocket, when Jones desired to see it. The muff was so very remarkable, that our heroe might possibly have recollected it without the information annexed. But his memory was not put to that hard office; for at the same instant he saw and read the words Sophia Western upon the paper which was pinned to it. His looks now grew frantic in a moment, and he eagerly cried out, "Oh Heavens! how came this muff here?" "I know no more than your honour," cried Partridge; "but I saw it upon the arm of one of the women who would have disturbed you, if I would have suffered them." "Where are they?" cries Jones, jumping out of bed, and laying hold of his cloaths. "Many miles off, I believe, by this time," said Partridge. And now Jones, upon further
485
enquiry, was sufficiently assured that the bearer of this muff was no other than the lovely Sophia herself.
The behaviour of Jones on this occasion, his thoughts, his looks, his words, his actions, were such as beggar all description. After many bitter execrations on Partridge, and not fewer on himself, he ordered the poor fellow, who was frightened out of his wits, to run down and hire him horses at any rate; and a very few minutes afterwards, having shuffled on his clothes, he hastened down-stairs to execute the orders himself, which he had just before given.
But before we proceed to what passed on his arrival in the kitchen, it will be necessary to recur to what had there happened since Partridge had first left it on his master's summons.
The serjeant was just marched off with his party, when the two Irish gentlemen arose, and came downstairs; both complaining that they had been so often waked by the noises in the inn, that they had never once been able to close their eyes all night.
The coach which had brought the young lady and her maid, and which, perhaps, the reader may have hitherto concluded was her own, was, indeed, a returned coach belonging to Mr King, of Bath, one of the worthiest and honestest men that ever dealt in horse-flesh, and whose coaches we heartily recommend to all our readers who travel that road. By which means they may, perhaps, have the pleasure of riding in the very coach, and being driven by the very coachman, that is recorded in this history.
The coachman, having but two passengers, and hearing Mr Maclach-lan was going to Bath, offered to carry him thither at a very moderate price. He was induced to this by the report of the hostler, who said that the horse which Mr Maclachlan had hired from Worcester would be much more pleased with returning to his friends there than to prosecute a long journey; for that the said horse was rather a two-legged than a four-legged animal.
Mr Maclachlan immediately closed with the proposal of the coachman, and, at the same time, persuaded his friend Fitzpatrick to accept of the fourth place in the coach. This conveyance the soreness of his bones made more agreeable to him than a horse; and, being well assured of meeting with his wife at Bath, he thought a little delay would be of no consequence.
Maclachlan, who was much the sharper man of the two, no sooner heard that this lady came from Chester, with the other circumstances
486
which he learned from the hostler, than it came into his head that she might possibly be his friend's wife; and presently acquainted him with this suspicion, which had never once occurred to Fitzpatrick himself. To say the truth, he was one of those compositions which nature makes up in too great a hurry, and forgets to put any brains into their head.
Now it happens to this sort of men, as to bad hounds, who never hit off a fault themselves; but no sooner doth a dog of sagacity open his mouth than they immediately do the same, and, without the guidance of any scent, run directly forwards as fast as they are able. In the same manner, the very moment Mr Maclachlan had mentioned his apprehension, Mr Fitzpatrick instantly concurred, and flew directly up-stairs, to surprize his wife, before he knew where she was; and unluckily (as Fortune loves to play tricks with those gentlemen who put themselves entirely under her conduct) ran his head against several doors and posts to no purpose. Much kinder was she to me, when she suggested that simile of the hounds, just before inserted; since the poor wife may, on these occasions, be so justly compared to a hunted hare. Like that little wretched animal, she pricks up her ears to listen after the voice of her pursuer; like her, flies away trembling when she hears it; and, like her, is generally overtaken and destroyed in the end.
This was not however the case at present; for after a long fruitless search, Mr Fitzpatrick returned to the kitchen, where, as if this had been a real chace, entered a gentleman hallowing as hunters do when the hounds are at a fault. He was just alighted from his horse, and had many attendants at his heels.
Here, reader, it may be necessary to acquaint thee with some matters, which, if thou dost know already, thou art wiser than I take thee to be. And this information thou shalt receive in the next chapter.

In which are concluded the adventures that happened at the inn at Upton.
In the first place, then, this gentleman just arrived was no other person than Squire Western himself, who was come hither in pursuit of his daughter; and, had he fortunately been two hours earlier, he had not only found her, but his niece into the bargain; for such was the wife of Mr Fitzpatrick, who had run away with her five years before, out of the custody of that sage lady, Madam Western.
Now this lady had departed from the inn much about the same time with Sophia; for, having been waked by the voice of her husband, she had sent up for the landlady, and being by her apprized of the matter, had bribed the good woman, at an extravagant price, to furnish her with horses for her escape. Such prevalence had money in this family; and though the mistress would have turned away her maid for a corrupt hussy, if she had known as much as the reader, yet she was no more proof against corruption herself than poor Susan had been.
Mr Western and his nephew were not known to one another; nor indeed would the former have taken any notice of the latter if he had known him; for, this being a stolen match, and consequently an unnatural one in the opinion of the good squire, he had, from the time of her committing it, abandoned the poor young creature, who was then no more than eighteen, as a monster, and had never since suffered her to be named in his presence.
The kitchen was now a scene of universal confusion, Western enquiring after his daughter, and Fitzpatrick as eagerly after his wife, when Jones entered the room, unfortunately having Sophia's muff in his hand.
As soon as Western saw Jones, he set up the same holla as is used by sportsmen when their game is in view. He then immediately run up and laid hold of Jones, crying, "We have got the dog fox, I warrant the bitch is not far off." The jargon which followed for some minutes, where many
488
spoke different things at the same time, as it would be very difficult to describe, so would it be no less unpleasant to read.
Jones having, at length, shaken Mr Western off, and some of the company having interfered between them, our heroe protested his innocence as to knowing anything of the lady; when Parson Supple stepped up, and said, "It is folly to deny it; for why, the marks of guilt are in thy hands. I will myself asseverate and bind it by an oath, that the muff thou bearest in thy hand belongeth unto Madam Sophia; for I have frequently observed her, of later days, to bear it about her." "My daughter's muff!" cries the squire in a rage. "Hath he got my daughter's muff? bear witness the goods are found upon him. I'll have him before a justice of peace this instant. Where is my daughter, villain?" "Sir," said Jones, "I beg you would be pacified. The muff, I acknowledge, is the young lady's; but, upon my honour, I have never seen her." At these words Western lost all patience, and grew inarticulate with rage.
Some of the servants had acquainted Fitzpatrick who Mr Western was. The good Irishman, therefore, thinking he had now an opportunity to do an act of service to his uncle, and by that means might possibly obtain his favour, stept up to Jones, and cried out, "Upon my conscience, sir, you may be ashamed of denying your having seen the gentleman's daughter before my face, when you know I found you there upon the bed together." Then, turning to Western, he offered to conduct him immediately to the room where his daughter was; which offer being accepted, he, the squire, the parson, and some others, ascended directly to Mrs Waters's chamber, which they entered with no less violence than Mr Fitzpatrick had done before.
The poor lady started from her sleep with as much amazement as terror, and beheld at her bedside a figure which might very well be supposed to have escaped out of Bedlam. Such wildness and confusion were in the looks of Mr Western; who no sooner saw the lady than he started back, shewing sufficiently by his manner, before he spoke, that this was not the person sought after.
So much more tenderly do women value their reputation than their persons, that, though the latter seemed now in more danger than before, yet, as the former was secure, the lady screamed not with such violence as she had done on the other occasion. However, she no sooner found herself alone than she abandoned all thoughts of further repose; and, as she had sufficient reason to be dissatisfied with her present lodging, she dressed herself with all possible expedition.
489
Mr Western now proceeded to search the whole house, but to as little purpose as he had disturbed poor Mrs Waters. He then returned disconsolate into the kitchen, where he found Jones in the custody of his servants.
This violent uproar had raised all the people in the house, though it was yet scarcely daylight. Among these was a grave gentleman, who had the honour to be in the commission of the peace for the county of Worcester. Of which Mr Western was no sooner informed than he offered to lay his complaint before him. The justice declined executing his office, as he said he had no clerk present, nor no book about justice business; and that he could not carry all the law in his head about stealing away daughters, and such sort of things.
Here Mr Fitzpatrick offered to lend him his assistance, informing the company that he had been himself bred to the law. (And indeed he had served three years as clerk to an attorney in the north of Ireland, when, chusing a genteeler walk in life, he quitted his master, came over to England, and set up that business which requires no apprenticeship, namely, that of a gentleman, in which he had succeeded, as hath been already partly mentioned.)
Mr Fitzpatrick declared that the law concerning daughters was out of the present case; that stealing a muff was undoubtedly felony, and the goods being found upon the person, were sufficient evidence of the fact.
The magistrate, upon the encouragement of so learned a coadjutor, and upon the violent intercession of the squire, was at length prevailed upon to seat himself in the chair of justice, where being placed, upon viewing the muff which Jones still held in his hand, and upon the parson's swearing it to be the property of Mr Western, he desired Mr Fitzpatrick to draw up a commitment, which he said he would sign.
Jones now desired to be heard, which was at last, with difficulty, granted him. He then produced the evidence of Mr Partridge, as to the finding it; but, what was still more, Susan deposed that Sophia herself had delivered the muff to her, and had ordered her to convey it into the chamber where Mr Jones had found it.
Whether a natural love of justice, or the extraordinary comeliness of Jones, had wrought on Susan to make the discovery, I will not determine; but such were the effects of her evidence, that the magistrate, throwing himself back in his chair, declared that the matter was now altogether as clear on the side of the prisoner as it had before been against him: with which the parson concurred, saying, the Lord forbid he should be
490
instrumental in committing an innocent person to durance. The justice then arose, acquitted the prisoner, and broke up the court.
Mr Western now gave every one present a hearty curse, and, immediately ordering his horses, departed in pursuit of his daughter, without taking the least notice of his nephew Fitzpatrick, or returning any answer to his claim of kindred, notwithstanding all the obligations he had just received from that gentleman. In the violence, moreover, of his hurry, and of his passion, he luckily forgot to demand the muff of Jones: I say luckily; for he would have died on the spot rather than have parted with it.
Jones likewise, with his friend Partridge, set forward the moment he had paid his reckoning, in quest of his lovely Sophia, whom he now resolved never more to abandon the pursuit of. Nor could he bring himself even to take leave of Mrs Waters; of whom he detested the very thoughts, as she had been, though not designedly, the occasion of his missing the happiest interview with Sophia, to whom he now vowed eternal constancy.
As for Mrs Waters, she took the opportunity of the coach which was going to Bath; for which place she set out in company with the two Irish gentlemen, the landlady kindly lending her her cloaths; in return for which she was contented only to receive about double their value, as a recompence for the loan. Upon the road she was perfectly reconciled to Mr Fitzpatrick, who was a very handsome fellow, and indeed did all she could to console him in the absence of his wife.
Thus ended the many odd adventures which Mr Jones encountered at his inn at Upton, where they talk, to this day, of the beauty and lovely behaviour of the charming Sophia, by the name of the Somersetshire angel.

Chapter V?
In which the history goes backward.
Before we proceed any farther in our history, it may be proper to look a little back, in order to account for the extraordinary appearance of Sophia and her father at the inn at Upton.
The reader may be pleased to remember that, in the ninth chapter of the seventh book of our history, we left Sophia, after a long debate between love and duty, deciding the cause, as it usually, I believe, happens, in favour of the former.
This debate had arisen, as we have there shown, from a visit which her father had just before made her, in order to force her consent to a marriage with Blifil; and which he had understood to be fully implied in her acknowledgment "that she neither must nor could refuse any absolute command of his."
Now from this visit the squire retired to his evening potation, overjoyed at the success he had gained with his daughter; and, as he was of a social disposition, and willing to have partakers in his happiness, the beer was ordered to flow very liberally into the kitchen; so that before eleven in the evening there was not a single person sober in the house except only Mrs Western herself and the charming Sophia.
Early in the morning a messenger was despatched to summon Mr Bli-fil; for, though the squire imagined that young gentleman had been much less acquainted than he really was with the former aversion of his daughter, as he had not, however, yet received her consent, he longed impatiently to communicate it to him, not doubting but that the intended bride herself would confirm it with her lips. As to the wedding, it had the evening before been fixed, by the male parties, to be celebrated on the next morning save one.
Breakfast was now set forth in the parlour, where Mr Blifil attended, and where the squire and his sister likewise were assembled; and now Sophia was ordered to be called.
492
O, Shakespear! had I thy pen! O, Hogarth! had I thy pencil! then would I draw the picture of the poor serving-man, who, with pale countenance, staring eyes, chattering teeth, faultering tongue, and trembling limbs,
(E'en such a man, so faint, so spiritless, So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone, Drew Priam's curtains in the dead of night, And would have told him, half his Troy was burn'd)
entered the room, and declared一That Madam Sophia was not to be found.
"Not to be found!" cries the squire, starting from his chair; "Zounds and d一nation! Blood and fury! Where, when, how, what一Not to be found! Where?"
"La! brother," said Mrs Western, with true political coldness, "you are always throwing yourself into such violent passions for nothing. My niece, I suppose, is only walked out into the garden. I protest you are grown so unreasonable, that it is impossible to live in the house with you."
"Nay, nay," answered the squire, returning as suddenly to himself, as he had gone from himself; "if that be all the matter, it signifies not much; but, upon my soul, my mind misgave me when the fellow said she was not to be found." He then gave orders for the bell to be rung in the garden, and sat himself contentedly down.
No two things could be more the reverse of each other than were the brother and sister in most instances; particularly in this, That as the brother never foresaw anything at a distance, but was most sagacious in immediately seeing everything the moment it had happened; so the sister eternally foresaw at a distance, but was not so quick-sighted to objects before her eyes. Of both these the reader may have observed examples: and, indeed, both their several talents were excessive; for, as the sister often foresaw what never came to pass, so the brother often saw much more than was actually the truth.
This was not however the case at present. The same report was brought from the garden as before had been brought from the chamber, that Madam Sophia was not to be found.
The squire himself now sallied forth, and began to roar forth the name of Sophia as loudly, and in as hoarse a voice, as whilome did Hercules that of Hylas; and, as the poet tells us that the whole shore echoed back the name of that beautiful youth, so did the house, the garden, and all
493
the neighbouring fields resound nothing but the name of Sophia, in the hoarse voices of the men, and in the shrill pipes of the women; while echo seemed so pleased to repeat the beloved sound, that, if there is really such a person, I believe Ovid hath belied her sex.
Nothing reigned for a long time but confusion; till at last the squire, having sufficiently spent his breath, returned to the parlour, where he found Mrs Western and Mr Blifil, and threw himself, with the utmost dejection in his countenance, into a great chair.
Here Mrs Western began to apply the following consolation:
"Brother, I am sorry for what hath happened; and that my niece should have behaved herself in a manner so unbecoming her family; but it is all your own doings, and you have nobody to thank but yourself. You know she hath been educated always in a manner directly contrary to my advice, and now you see the consequence. Have I not a thousand times argued with you about giving my niece her own will? But you know I never could prevail upon you; and when I had taken so much pains to eradicate her headstrong opinions, and to rectify your errors in policy, you know she was taken out of my hands; so that I have nothing to answer for. Had I been trusted entirely with the care of her education, no such accident as this had ever befallen you; so that you must comfort yourself by thinking it was all your own doing; and, indeed, what else could be expected from such indulgence?"
"Zounds! sister," answered he, "you are enough to make one mad. Have I indulged her? Have I given her her will?----It was no longer ago
than last night that I threatened, if she disobeyed me, to confine her to her chamber upon bread and water as long as she lived.------You would
provoke the patience of Job."
"Did ever mortal hear the like?" replied she. "Brother, if I had not the patience of fifty Jobs, you would make me forget all decency and decorum. Why would you interfere? Did I not beg you, did I not intreat you, to leave the whole conduct to me? You have defeated all the operations of the campaign by one false step. Would any man in his senses have provoked a daughter by such threats as these? How often have I told you that English women are not to be treated like Ciracessian 22 slaves. We have the protection of the world; we are to be won by gentle means only, and not to be hectored, and bullied, and beat into compliance. I thank Heaven no Salique law governs here. Brother, you have a roughness in
22.Possibly Circassian.
494
your manner which no woman but myself would bear. I do not wonder my niece was frightened and terrified into taking this measure; and, to speak honestly, I think my niece will be justified to the world for what she hath done. I repeat it to you again, brother, you must comfort yourself by rememb'ring that it is all your own fault. How often have I advised一"Here Western rose hastily from his chair, and, venting two or three horrid imprecations, ran out of the room.
When he was departed, his sister expressed more bitterness (if possible) against him than she had done while he was present; for the truth of which she appealed to Mr Blifil, who, with great complacence, acquiesced entirely in all she said; but excused all the faults of Mr Western, "as they must be considered," he said, "to have proceeded from the too inordinate fondness of a father, which must be allowed the name of an amiable weakness." "So much the more inexcuseable," answered the lady; "for whom doth he ruin by his fondness but his own child?" To which Blifil immediately agreed.
Mrs Western then began to express great confusion on the account of Mr Blifil, and of the usage which he had received from a family to which he intended so much honour. On this subject she treated the folly of her niece with great severity; but concluded with throwing the whole on her brother, who, she said, was inexcuseable to have proceeded so far without better assurances of his daughter's consent: "But he was (says she) always of a violent, headstrong temper; and I can scarce forgive myself for all the advice I have thrown away upon him."
After much of this kind of conversation, which, perhaps, would not greatly entertain the reader, was it here particularly related, Mr Blifil took his leave and returned home, not highly pleased with his disappointment: which, however, the philosophy which he had acquired from Square, and the religion infused into him by Thwackum, together with somewhat else, taught him to bear rather better than more passionate lovers bear these kinds of evils.

Chapter J
The escape of Sophia.
It is now time to look after Sophia; whom the reader, if he loves her half so well as I do, will rejoice to find escaped from the clutches of her passionate father, and from those of her dispassionate lover.
Twelve times did the iron register of time beat on the sonorous bellmetal, summoning the ghosts to rise and walk their nightly round.-In
plainer language, it was twelve o'clock, and all the family, as we have said, lay buried in drink and sleep, except only Mrs Western, who was deeply engaged in reading a political pamphlet, and except our heroine, who now softly stole down-stairs, and, having unbarred and unlocked one of the house-doors, sallied forth, and hastened to the place of appointment.
Notwithstanding the many pretty arts which ladies sometimes practise, to display their fears on every little occasion (almost as many as the other sex uses to conceal theirs), certainly there is a degree of courage which not only becomes a woman, but is often necessary to enable her to discharge her duty. It is, indeed, the idea of fierceness, and not of bravery, which destroys the female character; for who can read the story of the justly celebrated Arria without conceiving as high an opinion of her gentleness and tenderness as of her fortitude? At the same time, perhaps, many a woman who shrieks at a mouse, or a rat, may be capable of poisoning a husband; or, what is worse, of driving him to poison himself.
Sophia, with all the gentleness which a woman can have, had all the spirit which she ought to have. When, therefore, she came to the place of appointment, and, instead of meeting her maid, as was agreed, saw a man ride directly up to her, she neither screamed out nor fainted away: not that her pulse then beat with its usual regularity; for she was, at first, under some surprize and apprehension: but these were relieved almost as soon as raised, when the man, pulling off his hat, asked her, in a very
496
submissive manner, "If her ladyship did not expect to meet another lady?" and then proceeded to inform her that he was sent to conduct her to that lady.
Sophia could have no possible suspicion of any falsehood in this account: she therefore mounted resolutely behind the fellow, who conveyed her safe to a town about five miles distant, where she had the satisfaction of finding the good Mrs Honour: for, as the soul of the waitingwoman was wrapt up in those very habiliments which used to enwrap her body, she could by no means bring herself to trust them out of her sight. Upon these, therefore, she kept guard in person, while she detached the aforesaid fellow after her mistress, having given him all proper instructions.
They now debated what course to take, in order to avoid the pursuit of Mr Western, who they knew would send after them in a few hours. The London road had such charms for Honour, that she was desirous of going on directly; alleging that, as Sophia could not be missed till eight or nine the next morning, her pursuers would not be able to overtake her, even though they knew which way she had gone. But Sophia had too much at stake to venture anything to chance; nor did she dare trust too much to her tender limbs, in a contest which was to be decided only by swiftness. She resolved, therefore, to travel across the country, for at least twenty or thirty miles, and then to take the direct road to London. So, having hired horses to go twenty miles one way, when she intended to go twenty miles the other, she set forward with the same guide behind whom she had ridden from her father's house; the guide having now taken up behind him, in the room of Sophia, a much heavier, as well as much less lovely burden; being, indeed, a huge portmanteau, well stuffed with those outside ornaments, by means of which the fair Honour hoped to gain many conquests, and, finally, to make her fortune in London city.
When they had gone about two hundred paces from the inn on the London road, Sophia rode up to the guide, and, with a voice much fuller of honey than was ever that of Plato, though his mouth is supposed to have been a bee-hive, begged him to take the first turning which led towards Bristol.
Reader, I am not superstitious, nor any great believer of modern miracles. I do not, therefore, deliver the following as a certain truth; for, indeed, I can scarce credit it myself: but the fidelity of an historian obliges me to relate what hath been confidently asserted. The horse, then, on
497
which the guide rode, is reported to have been so charmed by Sophia's voice, that he made a full stop, and expressed an unwillingness to proceed any farther.
Perhaps, however, the fact may be true, and less miraculous than it hath been represented; since the natural cause seems adequate to the effect: for, as the guide at that moment desisted from a constant application of his armed right heel (for, like Hudibras, he wore but one spur), it is more than possible that this omission alone might occasion the beast to stop, especially as this was very frequent with him at other times.
But if the voice of Sophia had really an effect on the horse, it had very little on the rider. He answered somewhat surlily, "That measter had ordered him to go a different way, and that he should lose his place if he went any other than that he was ordered."
Sophia, finding all her persuasions had no effect, began now to add irresistible charms to her voice; charms which, according to the proverb, makes the old mare trot, instead of standing still; charms! to which modern ages have attributed all that irresistible force which the antients imputed to perfect oratory. In a word, she promised she would reward him to his utmost expectation.
The lad was not totally deaf to these promises; but he disliked their being indefinite; for, though perhaps he had never heard that word, yet that, in fact, was his objection. He said, "Gentlevolks did not consider the case of poor volks; that he had like to have been turned away the other day, for riding about the country with a gentleman from Squire Allworthy's, who did not reward him as he should have done."
"With whom?" says Sophia eagerly. "With a gentleman from Squire Allworthy's," repeated the lad; "the squire's son, I think they call 'un."一"Whither? which way did he go?" says Sophia.一"Why, a little o' one side o' Bristol, about twenty miles off," answered the lad.一"Guide me," says Sophia, "to the same place, and I'll give thee a guinea, or two, if one is not sufficient."一"To be certain," said the boy, "it is honestly worth two, when your ladyship considers what a risk I run; but, however, if your ladyship will promise me the two guineas, I'll e'en venture: to be certain it is a sinful thing to ride about my measter's horses; but one comfort is, I can only be turned away, and two guineas will partly make me amends."
The bargain being thus struck, the lad turned aside into the Bristol road, and Sophia set forward in pursuit of Jones, highly contrary to the remonstrances of Mrs Honour, who had much more desire to see
498
London than to see Mr Jones: for indeed she was not his friend with her mistress, as he had been guilty of some neglect in certain pecuniary civilities, which are by custom due to the waiting-gentlewoman in all love affairs, and more especially in those of a clandestine kind. This we impute rather to the carelessness of his temper than to any want of generosity; but perhaps she derived it from the latter motive. Certain it is that she hated him very bitterly on that account, and resolved to take every opportunity of injuring him with her mistress. It was therefore highly unlucky for her, that she had gone to the very same town and inn whence Jones had started, and still more unlucky was she in having stumbled on the same guide, and on this accidental discovery which Sophia had made.
Our travellers arrived at Hambrook 23 at the break of day, where Honour was against her will charged to enquire the route which Mr Jones had taken. Of this, indeed, the guide himself could have informed them; but Sophia, I know not for what reason, never asked him the question.
When Mrs Honour had made her report from the landlord, Sophia, with much difficulty, procured some indifferent horses, which brought her to the inn where Jones had been confined rather by the misfortune of meeting with a surgeon than by having met with a broken head.
Here Honour, being again charged with a commission of enquiry, had no sooner applied herself to the landlady, and had described the person of Mr Jones, than that sagacious woman began, in the vulgar phrase, to smell a rat. When Sophia therefore entered the room, instead of answering the maid, the landlady, addressing herself to the mistress, began the following speech: "Good lack-a-day! why there now, who would have thought it? I protest the loveliest couple that ever eye beheld. I-fackins, madam, it is no wonder the squire run on so about your ladyship. He told me indeed you was the finest lady in the world, and to be sure so you be. Mercy on him, poor heart! I bepitied him, so I did, when he used to hug his pillow, and call it his dear Madam Sophia. I did all I could to dissuade him from going to the wars: I told him there were men enow that were good for nothing else but to be killed, that had not the love of such fine ladies." "Sure," says Sophia, "the good woman is distracted." "No, no," cries the landlady, "I am not distracted. What, doth your ladyship think I don't know then? I assure you he told me all." "What saucy fellow," cries Honour, "told you anything of my lady?" "No saucy fellow," answered the landlady, "but the young gentleman you enquired
23.This was the village where Jones met the Quaker.
499
after, and a very pretty young gentleman he is, and he loves Madam Sophia Western to the bottom of his soul." "He love my lady! I'd have you to know, woman, she is meat for his master."一"Nay, Honour," said Sophia, interrupting her, "don't be angry with the good woman; she intends no harm." "No, marry, don't I," answered the landlady, emboldened by the soft accents of Sophia; and then launched into a long narrative too tedious to be here set down, in which some passages dropt that gave a little offence to Sophia, and much more to her waiting-woman, who hence took occasion to abuse poor Jones to her mistress the moment they were alone together, saying, "that he must be a very pitiful fellow, and could have no love for a lady, whose name he would thus prostitute in an ale-house."
Sophia did not see his behaviour in so very disadvantageous a light, and was perhaps more pleased with the violent raptures of his love (which the landlady exaggerated as much as she had done every other circumstance) than she was offended with the rest; and indeed she imputed the whole to the extravagance, or rather ebullience, of his passion, and to the openness of his heart.
This incident, however, being afterwards revived in her mind, and placed in the most odious colours by Honour, served to heighten and give credit to those unlucky occurrences at Upton, and assisted the waiting-woman in her endeavours to make her mistress depart from that inn without seeing Jones.
The landlady finding Sophia intended to stay no longer than till her horses were ready, and that without either eating or drinking, soon withdrew; when Honour began to take her mistress to task (for indeed she used great freedom), and after a long harangue, in which she reminded her of her intention to go to London, and gave frequent hints of the impropriety of pursuing a young fellow, she at last concluded with this serious exhortation: "For heaven's sake, madam, consider what you are about, and whither you are going."
This advice to a lady who had already rode near forty miles, and in no very agreeable season, may seem foolish enough. It may be supposed she had well considered and resolved this already; nay, Mrs Honour, by the hints she threw out, seemed to think so; and this I doubt not is the opinion of many readers, who have, I make no doubt, been long since well convinced of the purpose of our heroine, and have heartily condemned her for it as a wanton baggage.
500
But in reality this was not the case. Sophia had been lately so distracted between hope and fear, her duty and love to her father, her hatred to Blifil, her compassion, and (why should we not confess the truth?) her love for Jones; which last the behaviour of her father, of her aunt, of every one else, and more particularly of Jones himself, had blown into a flame, that her mind was in that confused state which may be truly said to make us ignorant of what we do, or whither we go, or rather, indeed, indifferent as to the consequence of either.
The prudent and sage advice of her maid produced, however, some cool reflection; and she at length determined to go to Gloucester, and thence to proceed directly to London.
But, unluckily, a few miles before she entered that town, she met the hack-attorney, who, as is before mentioned, had dined there with Mr Jones. This fellow, being well known to Mrs Honour, stopt and spoke to her; of which Sophia at that time took little notice, more than to enquire who he was.
But, having had a more particular account from Honour of this man afterwards at Gloucester, and hearing of the great expedition he usually made in travelling, for which (as hath been before observed) he was particularly famous; recollecting, likewise, that she had overheard Mrs Honour inform him that they were going to Gloucester, she began to fear lest her father might, by this fellow's means, be able to trace her to that city; wherefore, if she should there strike into the London road, she apprehended he would certainly be able to overtake her. She therefore altered her resolution; and, having hired horses to go a week's journey a way which she did not intend to travel, she again set forward after a light refreshment, contrary to the desire and earnest entreaties of her maid, and to the no less vehement remonstrances of Mrs Whitefield, who, from good breeding, or perhaps from good nature (for the poor young lady appeared much fatigued), pressed her very heartily to stay that evening at Gloucester.
Having refreshed herself only with some tea, and with lying about two hours on the bed, while her horses were getting ready, she resolutely left Mrs Whitefield's about eleven at night, and, striking directly into the Worcester road, within less than four hours arrived at that very inn where we last saw her.
Having thus traced our heroine very particularly back from her departure, till her arrival at Upton, we shall in a very few words bring her father to the same place; who, having received the first scent from the
501
post-boy, who conducted his daughter to Hambrook, very easily traced her afterwards to Gloucester; whence he pursued her to Upton, as he had learned Mr Jones had taken that route (for Partridge, to use the squire's expression, left everywhere a strong scent behind him), and he doubted not in the least but Sophia travelled, or, as he phrased it, ran, the same way. He used indeed a very coarse expression, which need not be here inserted; as fox-hunters, who alone will understand it, will easily suggest it to themselves.

Chapter 且
A crust for the critics.
In our last initial chapter we may be supposed to have treated that formidable set of men who are called critics with more freedom than becomes us; since they exact, and indeed generally receive, great condescension from authors. We shall in this, therefore, give the reasons of our conduct to this august body; and here we shall, perhaps, place them in a light in which they have not hitherto been seen.
This word critic is of Greek derivation, and signifies judgment. Hence I presume some persons who have not understood the original, and have seen the English translation of the primitive, have concluded that it meant judgment in the legal sense, in which it is frequently used as equivalent to condemnation.
I am the rather inclined to be of that opinion, as the greatest number of critics hath of late years been found amongst the lawyers. Many of these gentlemen, from despair, perhaps, of ever rising to the bench in Westminster-hall, have placed themselves on the benches at the playhouse, where they have exerted their judicial capacity, and have given judgment, i.e., condemned without mercy.
The gentlemen would, perhaps, be well enough pleased, if we were to leave them thus compared to one of the most important and honourable offices in the commonwealth, and, if we intended to apply to their favour, we would do so; but, as we design to deal very sincerely and plainly too with them, we must remind them of another officer of justice of a much lower rank; to whom, as they not only pronounce, but execute, their own judgment, they bear likewise some remote resemblance.
But in reality there is another light, in which these modern critics may, with great justice and propriety, be seen; and this is that of a common slanderer. If a person who prys into the characters of others, with no other design but to discover their faults, and to publish them to the world, deserves the title of a slanderer of the reputations of men, why should
504
not a critic, who reads with the same malevolent view, be as properly stiled the slanderer of the reputation of books?
Vice hath not, I believe, a more abject slave; society produces not a more odious vermin; nor can the devil receive a guest more worthy of him, nor possibly more welcome to him, than a slanderer. The world, I am afraid, regards not this monster with half the abhorrence which he deserves; and I am more afraid to assign the reason of this criminal lenity shown towards him; yet it is certain that the thief looks innocent in the comparison; nay, the murderer himself can seldom stand in competition with his guilt: for slander is a more cruel weapon than a sword, as the wounds which the former gives are always incurable. One method, indeed, there is of killing, and that the basest and most execrable of all, which bears an exact analogy to the vice here disclaimed against, and that is poison: a means of revenge so base, and yet so horrible, that it was once wisely distinguished by our laws from all other murders, in the peculiar severity of the punishment.
Besides the dreadful mischiefs done by slander, and the baseness of the means by which they are effected, there are other circumstances that highly aggravate its atrocious quality; for it often proceeds from no provocation, and seldom promises itself any reward, unless some black and infernal mind may propose a reward in the thoughts of having procured the ruin and misery of another.
Shakespear hath nobly touched this vice, when he says一
"Who steals my purse steals trash; 't is something, nothing; 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and hath been slave to thousands: But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that WHICH NOT ENRICHES HIM, BUT MAKES ME POOR INDEED."
With all this my good reader will doubtless agree; but much of it will probably seem too severe, when applied to the slanderer of books. But let it here be considered that both proceed from the same wicked disposition of mind, and are alike void of the excuse of temptation. Nor shall we conclude the injury done this way to be very slight, when we consider a book as the author's offspring, and indeed as the child of his brain.
The reader who hath suffered his muse to continue hitherto in a virgin state can have but a very inadequate idea of this kind of paternal fondness. To such we may parody the tender exclamation of Macduff, "Alas! Thou hast written no book." But the author whose muse hath brought forth will feel the pathetic strain, perhaps will accompany me with tears
505
(especially if his darling be already no more), while I mention the uneasiness with which the big muse bears about her burden, the painful labour with which she produces it, and, lastly, the care, the fondness, with which the tender father nourishes his favourite, till it be brought to maturity, and produced into the world.
Nor is there any paternal fondness which seems less to savour of absolute instinct, and which may so well be reconciled to worldly wisdom, as this. These children may most truly be called the riches of their father; and many of them have with true filial piety fed their parent in his old age: so that not only the affection, but the interest, of the author may be highly injured by these slanderers, whose poisonous breath brings his book to an untimely end.
Lastly, the slander of a book is, in truth, the slander of the author: for, as no one can call another bastard, without calling the mother a whore, so neither can any one give the names of sad stuff, horrid nonsense, &amp;c., to a book, without calling the author a blockhead; which, though in a moral sense it is a preferable appellation to that of villain, is perhaps rather more injurious to his worldly interest.
Now, however ludicrous all this may appear to some, others, I doubt not, will feel and acknowledge the truth of it; nay, may, perhaps, think I have not treated the subject with decent solemnity; but surely a man may speak truth with a smiling countenance. In reality, to depreciate a book maliciously, or even wantonly, is at least a very ill-natured office; and a morose snarling critic may, I believe, be suspected to be a bad man.
I will therefore endeavour, in the remaining part of this chapter, to explain the marks of this character, and to show what criticism I here intend to obviate: for I can never be understood, unless by the very persons here meant, to insinuate that there are no proper judges of writing, or to endeavour to exclude from the commonwealth of literature any of those noble critics to whose labours the learned world are so greatly indebted. Such were Aristotle, Horace, and Longinus, among the antients, Dacier and Bossu among the French, and some perhaps among us; who have certainly been duly authorised to execute at least a judicial authority in foro literario.
But without ascertaining all the proper qualifications of a critic, which I have touched on elsewhere, I think I may very boldly object to the censures of any one past upon works which he hath not himself read. Such censurers as these, whether they speak from their own guess or
506
suspicion, or from the report and opinion of others, may properly be said to slander the reputation of the book they condemn.
Such may likewise be suspected of deserving this character, who, without assigning any particular faults, condemn the whole in general defamatory terms; such as vile, dull, d—d stuff, &amp;c., and particularly by the use of the monosyllable low; a word which becomes the mouth of no critic who is not RIGHT HONOURABLE.
Again, though there may be some faults justly assigned in the work, yet, if those are not in the most essential parts, or if they are compensated by greater beauties, it will savour rather of the malice of a slanderer than of the judgment of a true critic to pass a severe sentence upon the whole, merely on account of some vicious part. This is directly contrary to the sentiments of Horace:
Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine, non ego paucis Offender maculis, quas aut incuria fudit, Aut humana parum cavit natura--
But where the beauties, more in number, shine, I am not angry, when a casual line (That with some trivial faults unequal flows) A careless hand or human frailty shows.—MR FRANCIS.
For, as Martial says, Aliter non fit, Avite, liber. No book can be otherwise composed. All beauty of character, as well as of countenance, and indeed of everything human, is to be tried in this manner. Cruel indeed would it be if such a work as this history, which hath employed some thousands of hours in the composing, should be liable to be condemned, because some particular chapter, or perhaps chapters, may be obnoxious to very just and sensible objections. And yet nothing is more common than the most rigorous sentence upon books supported by such objections, which, if they were rightly taken (and that they are not always), do by no means go to the merit of the whole. In the theatre especially, a single expression which doth not coincide with the taste of the audience, or with any individual critic of that audience, is sure to be hissed; and one scene which should be disapproved would hazard the whole piece. To write within such severe rules as these is as impossible as to live up to some splenetic opinions: and if we judge according to the sentiments of some critics, and of some Christians, no author will be saved in this world, and no man in the next.

Chapter
The adventures which Sophia met with after her leaving Upton.
Our history, just before it was obliged to turn about and travel backwards, had mentioned the departure of Sophia and her maid from the inn; we shall now therefore pursue the steps of that lovely creature, and leave her unworthy lover a little longer to bemoan his ill-luck, or rather his ill-conduct.
Sophia having directed her guide to travel through bye-roads, across the country, they now passed the Severn, and had scarce got a mile from the inn, when the young lady, looking behind her, saw several horses coming after on full speed. This greatly alarmed her fears, and she called to the guide to put on as fast as possible.
He immediately obeyed her, and away they rode a full gallop. But the faster they went, the faster were they followed; and as the horses behind were somewhat swifter than those before, so the former were at length overtaken. A happy circumstance for poor Sophia; whose fears, joined to her fatigue, had almost overpowered her spirits; but she was now instantly relieved by a female voice, that greeted her in the softest manner, and with the utmost civility. This greeting Sophia, as soon as she could recover her breath, with like civility, and with the highest satisfaction to herself, returned.
The travellers who joined Sophia, and who had given her such terror, consisted, like her own company, of two females and a guide. The two parties proceeded three full miles together before any one offered again to open their mouths; when our heroine, having pretty well got the better of her fear (but yet being somewhat surprized that the other still continued to attend her, as she pursued no great road, and had already passed through several turnings), accosted the strange lady in a most obliging tone, and said, "She was very happy to find they were both travelling the same way." The other, who, like a ghost, only wanted to be spoke to, readily answered, "That the happiness was entirely hers; that
508
she was a perfect stranger in that country, and was so overjoyed at meeting a companion of her own sex, that she had perhaps been guilty of an impertinence, which required great apology, in keeping pace with her." More civilities passed between these two ladies; for Mrs Honour had now given place to the fine habit of the stranger, and had fallen into the rear. But, though Sophia had great curiosity to know why the other lady continued to travel on through the same bye-roads with herself, nay, though this gave her some uneasiness, yet fear, or modesty, or some other consideration, restrained her from asking the question.
The strange lady now laboured under a difficulty which appears almost below the dignity of history to mention. Her bonnet had been blown from her head not less than five times within the last mile; nor could she come at any ribbon or handkerchief to tie it under her chin. When Sophia was informed of this, she immediately supplied her with a handkerchief for this purpose; which while she was pulling from her pocket, she perhaps too much neglected the management of her horse, for the beast, now unluckily making a false step, fell upon his fore-legs, and threw his fair rider from his back.
Though Sophia came head foremost to the ground, she happily received not the least damage: and the same circumstances which had perhaps contributed to her fall now preserved her from confusion; for the lane which they were then passing was narrow, and very much overgrown with trees, so that the moon could here afford very little light, and was moreover, at present, so obscured in a cloud, that it was almost perfectly dark. By these means the young lady's modesty, which was extremely delicate, escaped as free from injury as her limbs, and she was once more reinstated in her saddle, having received no other harm than a little fright by her fall.
Daylight at length appeared in its full lustre; and now the two ladies, who were riding over a common side by side, looking stedfastly at each other, at the same moment both their eyes became fixed; both their horses stopt, and, both speaking together, with equal joy pronounced, the one the name of Sophia, the other that of Harriet.
This unexpected encounter surprized the ladies much more than I believe it will the sagacious reader, who must have imagined that the strange lady could be no other than Mrs Fitzpatrick, the cousin of Miss Western, whom we before mentioned to have sallied from the inn a few minutes after her.
509
So great was the surprize and joy which these two cousins conceived at this meeting (for they had formerly been most intimate acquaintance and friends, and had long lived together with their aunt Western), that it is impossible to recount half the congratulations which passed between them, before either asked a very natural question of the other, namely, whither she was going?
This at last, however, came first from Mrs Fitzpatrick; but, easy and natural as the question may seem, Sophia found it difficult to give it a very ready and certain answer. She begged her cousin therefore to suspend all curiosity till they arrived at some inn, "which I suppose," says she, "can hardly be far distant; and, believe me, Harriet, I suspend as much curiosity on my side; for, indeed, I believe our astonishment is pretty equal."
The conversation which passed between these ladies on the road was, I apprehend, little worth relating; and less certainly was that between the two waiting-women; for they likewise began to pay their compliments to each other. As for the guides, they were debarred from the pleasure of discourse, the one being placed in the van, and the other obliged to bring up the rear.
In this posture they travelled many hours, till they came into a wide and well-beaten road, which, as they turned to the right, soon brought them to a very fair promising inn, where they all alighted: but so fatigued was Sophia, that as she had sat her horse during the last five or six miles with great difficulty, so was she now incapable of dismounting from him without assistance. This the landlord, who had hold of her horse, presently perceiving, offered to lift her in his arms from her saddle; and she too readily accepted the tender of his service. Indeed fortune seems to have resolved to put Sophia to the blush that day, and the second malicious attempt succeeded better than the first; for my landlord had no sooner received the young lady in his arms, than his feet, which the gout had lately very severely handled, gave way, and down he tumbled; but, at the same time, with no less dexterity than gallantry, contrived to throw himself under his charming burden, so that he alone received any bruise from the fall; for the great injury which happened to Sophia was a violent shock given to her modesty by an immoderate grin, which, at her rising from the ground, she observed in the countenances of most of the bye-standers. This made her suspect what had really happened, and what we shall not here relate for the indulgence of those readers who are capable of laughing at the offence given to a young lady's delicacy. Accidents of this kind we have never regarded in a
510
comical light; nor will we scruple to say that he must have a very inadequate idea of the modesty of a beautiful young woman, who would wish to sacrifice it to so paltry a satisfaction as can arise from laughter.
This fright and shock, joined to the violent fatigue which both her mind and body had undergone, almost overcame the excellent constitution of Sophia, and she had scarce strength sufficient to totter into the inn, leaning on the arm of her maid. Here she was no sooner seated than she called for a glass of water; but Mrs Honour, very judiciously, in my opinion, changed it into a glass of wine.
Mrs Fitzpatrick, hearing from Mrs Honour that Sophia had not been in bed during the two last nights, and observing her to look very pale and wan with her fatigue, earnestly entreated her to refresh herself with some sleep. She was yet a stranger to her history, or her apprehensions; but, had she known both, she would have given the same advice; for rest was visibly necessary for her; and their long journey through bye-roads so entirely removed all danger of pursuit, that she was herself perfectly easy on that account.
Sophia was easily prevailed on to follow the counsel of her friend, which was heartily seconded by her maid. Mrs Fitzpatrick likewise offered to bear her cousin company, which Sophia, with much complacence, accepted.
The mistress was no sooner in bed than the maid prepared to follow her example. She began to make many apologies to her sister Abigail for leaving her alone in so horrid a place as an inn; but the other stopt her short, being as well inclined to a nap as herself, and desired the honour of being her bedfellow. Sophia's maid agreed to give her a share of her bed, but put in her claim to all the honour. So, after many courtsies and compliments, to bed together went the waiting-women, as their mistresses had done before them.
It was usual with my landlord (as indeed it is with the whole fraternity) to enquire particularly of all coachmen, footmen, postboys, and others, into the names of all his guests; what their estate was, and where it lay. It cannot therefore be wondered at that the many particular circumstances which attended our travellers, and especially their retiring all to sleep at so extraordinary and unusual an hour as ten in the morning, should excite his curiosity. As soon, therefore, as the guides entered the kitchen, he began to examine who the ladies were, and whence they came; but the guides, though they faithfully related all they knew, gave
511
him very little satisfaction. On the contrary, they rather enflamed his curiosity than extinguished it.
This landlord had the character, among all his neighbours, of being a very sagacious fellow. He was thought to see farther and deeper into things than any man in the parish, the parson himself not excepted. Perhaps his look had contributed not a little to procure him this reputation; for there was in this something wonderfully wise and significant, especially when he had a pipe in his mouth; which, indeed, he seldom was without. His behaviour, likewise, greatly assisted in promoting the opinion of his wisdom. In his deportment he was solemn, if not sullen; and when he spoke, which was seldom, he always delivered himself in a slow voice; and, though his sentences were short, they were still interrupted with many hums and ha's, ay ays, and other expletives: so that, though he accompanied his words with certain explanatory gestures, such as shaking or nodding the head, or pointing with his fore-finger, he generally left his hearers to understand more than he expressed; nay, he commonly gave them a hint that he knew much more than he thought proper to disclose. This last circumstance alone may, indeed, very well account for his character of wisdom; since men are strangely inclined to worship what they do not understand. A grand secret, upon which several imposers on mankind have totally relied for the success of their frauds.
This polite person, now taking his wife aside, asked her "what she thought of the ladies lately arrived?" "Think of them?" said the wife, "why, what should I think of them?" "I know," answered he, "what I think. The guides tell strange stories. One pretends to be come from Gloucester, and the other from Upton; and neither of them, for what I can find, can tell whither they are going. But what people ever travel across the country from Upton hither, especially to London? And one of the maid-servants, before she alighted from her horse, asked if this was not the London road? Now I have put all these circumstances together, and whom do you think I have found them out to be?" "Nay," answered she, "you know I never pretend to guess at your discoveries."---"It is a
good girl," replied he, chucking her under the chin; "I must own you have always submitted to my knowledge of these matters. Why, then, depend upon it; mind what I say一depend upon it, they are certainly some of the rebel ladies, who, they say, travel with the young Chevalier; and have taken a roundabout way to escape the duke's army."
"Husband," quoth the wife, "you have certainly hit it; for one of them is dressed as fine as any princess; and, to be sure, she looks for all the
512
world like one.----But yet, when I consider one thing"----"When you
consider," cries the landlord contemptuously---"Come, pray let's hear
what you consider."----"Why, it is," answered the wife, "that she is too
humble to be any very great lady: for, while our Betty was warming the bed, she called her nothing but child, and my dear, and sweetheart; and, when Betty offered to pull off her shoes and stockings, she would not suffer her, saying, she would not give her the trouble."
"Pugh!" answered the husband, "that is nothing. Dost think, because you have seen some great ladies rude and uncivil to persons below them, that none of them know how to behave themselves when they come before their inferiors? I think I know people of fashion when I see them—I think I do. Did not she call for a glass of water when she came in? Another sort of women would have called for a dram; you know they would. If she be not a woman of very great quality, sell me for a fool; and, I believe, those who buy me will have a bad bargain. Now, would a woman of her quality travel without a footman, unless upon some such extraordinary occasion?" "Nay, to be sure, husband," cries she, "you know these matters better than I, or most folk." "I think I do know something," said he. "To be sure," answered the wife, "the poor little heart looked so piteous, when she sat down in the chair, I protest I could not help having a compassion for her almost as much as if she had been a poor body. But what's to be done, husband? If an she be a rebel, I suppose you intend to betray her up to the court. Well, she's a sweet-tempered, good-humoured lady, be she what she will, and I shall hardly refrain from crying when I hear she is hanged or beheaded." "Pooh!" answered the husband.-----"But, as to what's to be done, it is not so easy a matter to de-
termine. I hope, before she goes away, we shall have the news of a battle; for, if the Chevalier should get the better, she may gain us interest at court, and make our fortunes without betraying her." "Why, that's true," replied the wife; "and I heartily hope she will have it in her power. Certainly she's a sweet good lady; it would go horribly against me to have her come to any harm." "Pooh!" cries the landlord, "women are always so tender-hearted. Why, you would not harbour rebels, would you?" "No, certainly," answered the wife; "and as for betraying her, come what will on't, nobody can blame us. It is what anybody would do in our case."
While our politic landlord, who had not, we see, undeservedly the reputation of great wisdom among his neighbours, was engaged in debating this matter with himself (for he paid little attention to the opinion of his wife), news arrived that the rebels had given the duke the slip, and had got a day's march towards London; and soon after arrived a famous
513
Jacobite squire, who, with great joy in his countenance, shook the landlord by the hand, saying, "All's our own, boy, ten thousand honest Frenchmen are landed in Suffolk. Old England for ever! ten thousand French, my brave lad! I am going to tap away directly."
This news determined the opinion of the wise man, and he resolved to make his court to the young lady when she arose; for he had now (he said) discovered that she was no other than Madam Jenny Cameron herself.

Chapter U
A very short chapter, in which however is a sun, a moon, a star, and an angel.
The sun (for he keeps very good hours at this time of the year) had been some time retired to rest when Sophia arose greatly refreshed by her sleep; which, short as it was, nothing but her extreme fatigue could have occasioned; for, though she had told her maid, and perhaps herself too, that she was perfectly easy when she left Upton, yet it is certain her mind was a little affected with that malady which is attended with all the restless symptoms of a fever, and is perhaps the very distemper which physicians mean (if they mean anything) by the fever on the spirits.
Mrs Fitzpatrick likewise left her bed at the same time; and, having summoned her maid, immediately dressed herself. She was really a very pretty woman, and, had she been in any other company but that of Sophia, might have been thought beautiful; but when Mrs Honour of her own accord attended (for her mistress would not suffer her to be waked), and had equipped our heroine, the charms of Mrs Fitzpatrick, who had performed the office of the morning-star, and had preceded greater glories, shared the fate of that star, and were totally eclipsed the moment those glories shone forth.
Perhaps Sophia never looked more beautiful than she did at this instant. We ought not, therefore, to condemn the maid of the inn for her hyperbole, who, when she descended, after having lighted the fire, declared, and ratified it with an oath, that if ever there was an angel upon earth, she was now above-stairs.
Sophia had acquainted her cousin with her design to go to London; and Mrs Fitzpatrick had agreed to accompany her; for the arrival of her husband at Upton had put an end to her design of going to Bath, or to her aunt Western. They had therefore no sooner finished their tea than Sophia proposed to set out, the moon then shining extremely bright, and as for the frost she defied it; nor had she any of those apprehensions
515
which many young ladies would have felt at travelling by night; for she had, as we have before observed, some little degree of natural courage; and this, her present sensations, which bordered somewhat on despair, greatly encreased. Besides, as she had already travelled twice with safety by the light of the moon, she was the better emboldened to trust to it a third time.
The disposition of Mrs Fitzpatrick was more timorous; for, though the greater terrors had conquered the less, and the presence of her husband had driven her away at so unseasonable an hour from Upton, yet, being now arrived at a place where she thought herself safe from his pursuit, these lesser terrors of I know not what operated so strongly, that she earnestly entreated her cousin to stay till the next morning, and not expose herself to the dangers of travelling by night.
Sophia, who was yielding to an excess, when she could neither laugh nor reason her cousin out of these apprehensions, at last gave way to them. Perhaps, indeed, had she known of her father's arrival at Upton, it might have been more difficult to have persuaded her; for as to Jones, she had, I am afraid, no great horror at the thoughts of being overtaken by him; nay, to confess the truth, I believe she rather wished than feared it; though I might honestly enough have concealed this wish from the reader, as it was one of those secret spontaneous emotions of the soul to which the reason is often a stranger.
When our young ladies had determined to remain all that evening in their inn they were attended by the landlady, who desired to know what their ladyships would be pleased to eat. Such charms were there in the voice, in the manner, and in the affable deportment of Sophia, that she ravished the landlady to the highest degree; and that good woman, concluding that she had attended Jenny Cameron, became in a moment a stanch Jacobite, and wished heartily well to the young Pretender's cause, from the great sweetness and affability with which she had been treated by his supposed mistress.
The two cousins began now to impart to each other their reciprocal curiosity to know what extraordinary accidents on both sides occasioned this so strange and unexpected meeting. At last Mrs Fitzpatrick, having obtained of Sophia a promise of communicating likewise in her turn, began to relate what the reader, if he is desirous to know her history, may read in the ensuing chapter.
516
The history of Mrs Fitzpatrick.
Mrs Fitzpatrick, after a silence of a few moments, fetching a deep sigh, thus began:
"It is natural to the unhappy to feel a secret concern in recollecting those periods of their lives which have been most delightful to them. The remembrance of past pleasures affects us with a kind of tender grief, like what we suffer for departed friends; and the ideas of both may be said to haunt our imaginations.
"For this reason, I never reflect without sorrow on those days (the happiest far of my life) which we spent together when both were under the care of my aunt Western. Alas! why are Miss Graveairs and Miss Giddy no more? You remember, I am sure, when we knew each other by no other names. Indeed, you gave the latter appellation with too much cause. I have since experienced how much I deserved it. You, my Sophia, was always my superior in everything, and I heartily hope you will be so in your fortune. I shall never forget the wise and matronly advice you once gave me, when I lamented being disappointed of a ball, though you could not be then fourteen years old.-----O my Sophy, how blest must
have been my situation, when I could think such a disappointment a misfortune; and when indeed it was the greatest I had ever known!"
"And yet, my dear Harriet," answered Sophia, "it was then a serious matter with you. Comfort yourself therefore with thinking, that whatever you now lament may hereafter appear as trifling and contemptible as a ball would at this time."
"Alas, my Sophia," replied the other lady, "you yourself will think otherwise of my present situation; for greatly must that tender heart be altered if my misfortunes do not draw many a sigh, nay, many a tear, from you. The knowledge of this should perhaps deter me from relating what I am convinced will so much affect you." Here Mrs Fitzpatrick stopt, till, at the repeated entreaties of Sophia, she thus proceeded:
517
"Though you must have heard much of my marriage; yet, as matters may probably have been misrepresented, I will set out from the very commencement of my unfortunate acquaintance with my present husband; which was at Bath, soon after you left my aunt, and returned home to your father.
"Among the gay young fellows who were at this season at Bath, Mr Fitzpatrick was one. He was handsome, degage, extremely gallant, and in his dress exceeded most others. In short, my dear, if you was unluckily to see him now, I could describe him no better than by telling you he was the very reverse of everything which he is: for he hath rusticated himself so long, that he is become an absolute wild Irishman. But to proceed in my story: the qualifications which he then possessed so well recommended him, that, though the people of quality at that time lived separate from the rest of the company, and excluded them from all their parties, Mr Fitzpatrick found means to gain admittance. It was perhaps no easy matter to avoid him; for he required very little or no invitation; and as, being handsome and genteel, he found it no very difficult matter to ingratiate himself with the ladies, so, he having frequently drawn his sword, the men did not care publickly to affront him. Had it not been for some such reason, I believe he would have been soon expelled by his own sex; for surely he had no strict title to be preferred to the English gentry; nor did they seem inclined to show him any extraordinary favour. They all abused him behind his back, which might probably proceed from envy; for by the women he was well received, and very particularly distinguished by them.
"My aunt, though no person of quality herself, as she had always lived about the court, was enrolled in that party; for, by whatever means you get into the polite circle, when you are once there, it is sufficient merit for you that you are there. This observation, young as you was, you could scarce avoid making from my aunt, who was free, or reserved, with all people, just as they had more or less of this merit.
"And this merit, I believe, it was, which principally recommended Mr Fitzpatrick to her favour. In which he so well succeeded, that he was always one of her private parties. Nor was he backward in returning such distinction; for he soon grew so very particular in his behaviour to her, that the scandal club first began to take notice of it, and the better-disposed persons made a match between them. For my own part, I confess, I made no doubt but that his designs were strictly honourable, as the phrase is; that is, to rob a lady of her fortune by way of marriage. My aunt was, I conceived, neither young enough nor handsome enough to
518
attract much wicked inclination; but she had matrimonial charms in great abundance.
"I was the more confirmed in this opinion from the extraordinary respect which he showed to myself from the first moment of our acquaintance. This I understood as an attempt to lessen, if possible, that disinclination which my interest might be supposed to give me towards the match; and I know not but in some measure it had that effect; for, as I was well contented with my own fortune, and of all people the least a slave to interested views, so I could not be violently the enemy of a man with whose behaviour to me I was greatly pleased; and the more so, as I was the only object of such respect; for he behaved at the same time to many women of quality without any respect at all.
"Agreeable as this was to me, he soon changed it into another kind of behaviour, which was perhaps more so. He now put on much softness and tenderness, and languished and sighed abundantly. At times, indeed, whether from art or nature I will not determine, he gave his usual loose to gaiety and mirth; but this was always in general company, and with other women; for even in a country-dance, when he was not my partner, he became grave, and put on the softest look imaginable the moment he approached me. Indeed he was in all things so very particular towards me, that I must have been blind not to have discovered it. And, and, and-----" "And you was more pleased still, my dear Harriet," cries
Sophia; "you need not be ashamed," added she, sighing; "for sure there are irresistible charms in tenderness, which too many men are able to affect." "True," answered her cousin; "men, who in all other instances want common sense, are very Machiavels in the art of loving. I wish I did not know an instance.一Well, scandal now began to be as busy with me as it had before been with my aunt; and some good ladies did not scruple to affirm that Mr Fitzpatrick had an intrigue with us both.
"But, what may seem astonishing, my aunt never saw, nor in the least seemed to suspect, that which was visible enough, I believe, from both our behaviours. One would indeed think that love quite puts out the eyes of an old woman. In fact, they so greedily swallow the addresses which are made to them, that, like an outrageous glutton, they are not at leisure to observe what passes amongst others at the same table. This I have observed in more cases than my own; and this was so strongly verified by my aunt, that, though she often found us together at her return from the pump, the least canting word of his, pretending impatience at her absence, effectually smothered all suspicion. One artifice succeeded with her to admiration. This was his treating me like a little child, and
519
never calling me by any other name in her presence but that of pretty miss. This indeed did him some disservice with your humble servant; but I soon saw through it, especially as in her absence he behaved to me, as I have said, in a different manner. However, if I was not greatly disobliged by a conduct of which I had discovered the design, I smarted very severely for it; for my aunt really conceived me to be what her lover (as she thought him) called me, and treated me in all respects as a perfect infant. To say the truth, I wonder she had not insisted on my again wearing leading-strings.
"At last, my lover (for so he was) thought proper, in a most solemn manner, to disclose a secret which I had known long before. He now placed all the love which he had pretended to my aunt to my account. He lamented, in very pathetic terms, the encouragement she had given him, and made a high merit of the tedious hours in which he had undergone her conversation.一What shall I tell you, my dear Sophia?一Then I will confess the truth. I was pleased with my man. I was pleased with my conquest. To rival my aunt delighted me; to rival so many other women charmed me. In short, I am afraid I did not behave as I should do, even upon the very first declaration一I wish I did not almost give him positive encouragement before we parted.
"The Bath now talked loudly一I might almost say, roared against me. Several young women affected to shun my acquaintance, not so much, perhaps, from any real suspicion, as from a desire of banishing me from a company in which I too much engrossed their favourite man. And here I cannot omit expressing my gratitude to the kindness intended me by Mr Nash, who took me one day aside, and gave me advice, which if I had followed, I had been a happy woman. 'Child,' says he, 'I am sorry to see the familiarity which subsists between you and a fellow who is altogether unworthy of you, and I am afraid will prove your ruin. As for your old stinking aunt, if it was to be no injury to you and my pretty Sophy Western (I assure you I repeat his words), I should be heartily glad that the fellow was in possession of all that belongs to her. I never advise old women: for, if they take it into their heads to go to the devil, it is no more possible than worth while to keep them from him. Innocence and youth and beauty are worthy a better fate, and I would save them from his clutches. Let me advise you therefore, dear child, never suffer this fellow to be particular with you again.' Many more things he said to me, which I have now forgotten, and indeed I attended very little to them at the time; for inclination contradicted all he said; and, besides, I
520
could not be persuaded that women of quality would condescend to familiarity with such a person as he described.
"But I am afraid, my dear, I shall tire you with a detail of so many minute circumstances. To be concise, therefore, imagine me married; imagine me with my husband, at the feet of my aunt; and then imagine the maddest woman in Bedlam, in a raving fit, and your imagination will suggest to you no more than what really happened.
"The very next day my aunt left the place, partly to avoid seeing Mr Fitzpatrick or myself, and as much perhaps to avoid seeing any one else; for, though I am told she hath since denied everything stoutly, I believe she was then a little confounded at her disappointment. Since that time, I have written to her many letters, but never could obtain an answer, which I must own sits somewhat the heavier, as she herself was, though undesignedly, the occasion of all my sufferings: for, had it not been under the colour of paying his addresses to her, Mr Fitzpatrick would never have found sufficient opportunities to have engaged my heart, which, in other circumstances, I still flatter myself would not have been an easy conquest to such a person. Indeed, I believe I should not have erred so grossly in my choice if I had relied on my own judgment; but I trusted totally to the opinion of others, and very foolishly took the merit of a man for granted whom I saw so universally well received by the women. What is the reason, my dear, that we, who have understandings equal to the wisest and greatest of the other sex, so often make choice of the silliest fellows for companions and favourites? It raises my indignation to the highest pitch to reflect on the numbers of women of sense who have been undone by fools." Here she paused a moment; but, Sophia making no answer, she proceeded as in the next chapter.

Chapter U
In which the history of Mrs Fitzpatrick is continued.
"We remained at Bath no longer than a fortnight after our wedding; for as to any reconciliation with my aunt, there were no hopes; and of my fortune not one farthing could be touched till I was of age, of which I now wanted more than two years. My husband therefore was resolved to set out for Ireland; against which I remonstrated very earnestly, and insisted on a promise which he had made me before our marriage that I should never take this journey against my consent; and indeed I never intended to consent to it; nor will anybody, I believe, blame me for that resolution; but this, however, I never mentioned to my husband, and petitioned only for the reprieve of a month; but he had fixed the day, and to that day he obstinately adhered.
"The evening before our departure, as we were disputing this point with great eagerness on both sides, he started suddenly from his chair, and left me abruptly, saying he was going to the rooms. He was hardly out of the house when I saw a paper lying on the floor, which, I suppose, he had carelessly pulled from his pocket, together with his handkerchief. This paper I took up, and, finding it to be a letter, I made no scruple to open and read it; and indeed I read it so often that I can repeat it to you almost word for word. This then was the letter:
'To Mr Brian Fitzpatrick.
'SIR,
'YOURS received, and am surprized you should use me in this manner, as have never seen any of your cash, unless for one linsey-woolsey coat, and your bill now is upwards of £150. Consider, sir, how often you have fobbed me off with your being shortly to be married to this lady and t'other lady; but I can neither live on hopes or promises, nor will my woollen-draper take any such in payment. You tell me you are secure of having either the aunt or the niece, and that you might have married the aunt before this, whose jointure you say is immense, but that you prefer
522
the niece on account of her ready money. Pray, sir, take a fool's advice for once, and marry the first you can get. You will pardon my offering my advice, as you know I sincerely wish you well. Shall draw on you per next post, in favour of Messieurs John Drugget and company, at fourteen days, which doubt not your honouring, and am,
Sir, your humble servant, 'SAM. COSGRAVE.'
"This was the letter, word for word. Guess, my dear girl一guess how this letter affected me. You prefer the niece on account of her ready money! If every one of these words had been a dagger, I could with pleasure have stabbed them into his heart; but I will not recount my frantic behaviour on the occasion. I had pretty well spent my tears before his return home; but sufficient remains of them appeared in my swollen eyes. He threw himself sullenly into his chair, and for a long time we were both silent. At length, in a haughty tone, he said, 'I hope, madam, your servants have packed up all your things; for the coach will be ready by six in the morning.' My patience was totally subdued by this provocation, and I answered, 'No, sir, there is a letter still remains unpacked;' and then throwing it on the table I fell to upbraiding him with the most bitter language I could invent.
"Whether guilt, or shame, or prudence, restrained him I cannot say; but, though he is the most passionate of men, he exerted no rage on this occasion. He endeavoured, on the contrary, to pacify me by the most gentle means. He swore the phrase in the letter to which I principally objected was not his, nor had he ever written any such. He owned, indeed, the having mentioned his marriage, and that preference which he had given to myself, but denied with many oaths the having mentioned any such matter at all on account of the straits he was in for money, arising, he said, from his having too long neglected his estate in Ireland. And this, he said, which he could not bear to discover to me, was the only reason of his having so strenuously insisted on our journey. He then used several very endearing expressions, and concluded by a very fond caress, and many violent protestations of love.
"There was one circumstance which, though he did not appeal to it, had much weight with me in his favour, and that was the word jointure in the taylor's letter, whereas my aunt never had been married, and this Mr Fitzpatrick well knew.----As I imagined, therefore, that the fellow
must have inserted this of his own head, or from hearsay, I persuaded myself he might have ventured likewise on that odious line on no better authority. What reasoning was this, my dear? was I not an advocate
523
rather than a judge?一But why do I mention such a circumstance as this, or appeal to it for the justification of my forgiveness?一In short, had he been guilty of twenty times as much, half the tenderness and fondness which he used would have prevailed on me to have forgiven him. I now made no farther objections to our setting out, which we did the next morning, and in a little more than a week arrived at the seat of Mr Fitzpatrick.
"Your curiosity will excuse me from relating any occurrences which past during our journey; for it would indeed be highly disagreeable to travel it over again, and no less so to you to travel it over with me.
"This seat, then, is an ancient mansion-house: if I was in one of those merry humours in which you have so often seen me, I could describe it to you ridiculously enough. It looked as if it had been formerly inhabited by a gentleman. Here was room enough, and not the less room on account of the furniture; for indeed there was very little in it. An old woman, who seemed coeval with the building, and greatly resembled her whom Chamont mentions in the Orphan, received us at the gate, and in a howl scarce human, and to me unintelligible, welcomed her master home. In short, the whole scene was so gloomy and melancholy, that it threw my spirits into the lowest dejection; which my husband discerning, instead of relieving, encreased by two or three malicious observations. 'There are good houses, madam,' says he, 'as you find, in other places besides England; but perhaps you had rather be in a dirty lodgings at Bath.'
"Happy, my dear, is the woman who, in any state of life, hath a cheerful good-natured companion to support and comfort her! But why do I reflect on happy situations only to aggravate my own misery? my companion, far from clearing up the gloom of solitude, soon convinced me that I must have been wretched with him in any place, and in any condition. In a word, he was a surly fellow, a character perhaps you have never seen; for, indeed, no woman ever sees it exemplified but in a father, a brother, or a husband; and, though you have a father, he is not of that character. This surly fellow had formerly appeared to me the very reverse, and so he did still to every other person. Good heaven! how is it possible for a man to maintain a constant lie in his appearance abroad and in company, and to content himself with shewing disagreeable truth only at home? Here, my dear, they make themselves amends for the uneasy restraint which they put on their tempers in the world; for I have observed, the more merry and gay and good-humoured my husband hath at any time been in company, the more sullen and morose he was
524
sure to become at our next private meeting. How shall I describe his barbarity? To my fondness he was cold and insensible. My little comical ways, which you, my Sophy, and which others, have called so agreeable, he treated with contempt. In my most serious moments he sung and whistled; and whenever I was thoroughly dejected and miserable he was angry, and abused me: for, though he was never pleased with my goodhumour, nor ascribed it to my satisfaction in him, yet my low spirits always offended him, and those he imputed to my repentance of having (as he said) married an Irishman.
"You will easily conceive, my dear Graveairs (I ask your pardon, I really forgot myself), that, when a woman makes an imprudent match in the sense of the world, that is, when she is not an arrant prostitute to pecuniary interest, she must necessarily have some inclination and affection for her man. You will as easily believe that this affection may possibly be lessened; nay, I do assure you, contempt will wholly eradicate it. This contempt I now began to entertain for my husband, whom I now discovered to be一I must use the expression一an arrant blockhead. Perhaps you will wonder I did not make this discovery long before; but women will suggest a thousand excuses to themselves for the folly of those they like: besides, give me leave to tell you, it requires a most penetrating eye to discern a fool through the disguises of gaiety and good breeding.
"It will be easily imagined that, when I once despised my husband, as I confess to you I soon did, I must consequently dislike his company; and indeed I had the happiness of being very little troubled with it; for our house was now most elegantly furnished, our cellars well stocked, and dogs and horses provided in great abundance. As my gentleman therefore entertained his neighbours with great hospitality, so his neighbours resorted to him with great alacrity; and sports and drinking consumed so much of his time, that a small part of his conversation, that is to say, of his ill-humours, fell to my share.
"Happy would it have been for me if I could as easily have avoided all other disagreeable company; but, alas! I was confined to some which constantly tormented me; and the more, as I saw no prospect of being relieved from them. These companions were my own racking thoughts, which plagued and in a manner haunted me night and day. In this situation I past through a scene, the horrors of which can neither be painted nor imagined. Think, my dear, figure, if you can, to yourself, what I must have undergone. I became a mother by the man I scorned, hated, and detested. I went through all the agonies and miseries of a lying-in (ten times more painful in such a circumstance than the worst labour can be
525
when one endures it for a man one loves) in a desert, or rather, indeed, a scene of riot and revel, without a friend, without a companion, or without any of those agreeable circumstances which often alleviate, and perhaps sometimes more than compensate, the sufferings of our sex at that season."

In which the mistake of the landlord throws Sophia into a dreadful consternation.
Mrs Fitzpatrick was proceeding in her narrative when she was interrupted by the entrance of dinner, greatly to the concern of Sophia; for the misfortunes of her friend had raised her anxiety, and left her no appetite but what Mrs Fitzpatrick was to satisfy by her relation.
The landlord now attended with a plate under his arm, and with the same respect in his countenance and address which he would have put on had the ladies arrived in a coach and six.
The married lady seemed less affected with her own misfortunes than was her cousin; for the former eat very heartily, whereas the latter could hardly swallow a morsel. Sophia likewise showed more concern and sorrow in her countenance than appeared in the other lady; who, having observed these symptoms in her friend, begged her to be comforted, saying, "Perhaps all may yet end better than either you or I expect."
Our landlord thought he had now an opportunity to open his mouth, and was resolved not to omit it. "I am sorry, madam," cries he, "that your ladyship can't eat; for to be sure you must be hungry after so long fasting. I hope your ladyship is not uneasy at anything, for, as madam there says, all may end better than anybody expects. A gentleman who was here just now brought excellent news; and perhaps some folks who have given other folks the slip may get to London before they are overtaken; and if they do, I make no doubt but they will find people who will be very ready to receive them."
All persons under the apprehension of danger convert whatever they see and hear into the objects of that apprehension. Sophia therefore immediately concluded, from the foregoing speech, that she was known, and pursued by her father. She was now struck with the utmost consternation, and for a few minutes deprived of the power of speech; which she no sooner recovered than she desired the landlord to send his
527
servants out of the room, and then, addressing herself to him, said, "I perceive, sir, you know who we are; but I beseech you一nay, I am convinced, if you have any compassion or goodness, you will not betray us."
"I betray your ladyship!" quoth the landlord; "no (and then he swore several very hearty oaths); I would sooner be cut into ten thousand pieces. I hate all treachery. I! I never betrayed any one in my life yet, and I am sure I shall not begin with so sweet a lady as your ladyship. All the world would very much blame me if I should, since it will be in your ladyship's power so shortly to reward me. My wife can witness for me, I knew your ladyship the moment you came into the house: I said it was your honour, before I lifted you from your horse, and I shall carry the bruises I got in your ladyship's service to the grave; but what signified that, as long as I saved your ladyship? To be sure some people this morning would have thought of getting a reward; but no such thought ever entered into my head. I would sooner starve than take any reward for betraying your ladyship."
"I promise you, sir," says Sophia, "if it be ever in my power to reward you, you shall not lose by your generosity."
"Alack-a-day, madam!" answered the landlord; "in your ladyship's power! Heaven put it as much into your will! I am only afraid your honour will forget such a poor man as an innkeeper; but, if your ladyship should not, I hope you will remember what reward I refused一refused! that is, I would have refused, and to be sure it may be called refusing, for I might have had it certainly; and to be sure you might have been in some houses;一but, for my part, would not methinks for the world have your ladyship wrong me so much as to imagine I ever thought of betraying you, even before I heard the good news."
"What news, pray?" says Sophia, something eagerly.
"Hath not your ladyship heard it, then?" cries the landlord; "nay, like enough, for I heard it only a few minutes ago; and if I had never heard it, may the devil fly away with me this instant if I would have betrayed your honour! no, if I would, may I一" Here he subjoined several dreadful imprecations, which Sophia at last interrupted, and begged to know what he meant by the news.一He was going to answer, when Mrs Honour came running into the room, all pale and breathless, and cried out, "Madam, we are all undone, all ruined, they are come, they are come!" These words almost froze up the blood of Sophia; but Mrs Fitzpatrick asked Honour who were come?一"Who?" answered she, "why, the
528
French; several hundred thousands of them are landed, and we shall be all murdered and ravished."
As a miser, who hath, in some well-built city, a cottage, value twenty shillings, when at a distance he is alarmed with the news of a fire, turns pale and trembles at his loss; but when he finds the beautiful palaces only are burnt, and his own cottage remains safe, he comes instantly to himself, and smiles at his good fortunes: or as (for we dislike something in the former simile) the tender mother, when terrified with the apprehension that her darling boy is drowned, is struck senseless and almost dead with consternation; but when she is told that little master is safe, and the Victory only, with twelve hundred brave men, gone to the bottom, life and sense again return, maternal fondness enjoys the sudden relief from all its fears, and the general benevolence which at another time would have deeply felt the dreadful catastrophe, lies fast asleep in her mind;一so Sophia, than whom none was more capable of tenderly feeling the general calamity of her country, found such immediate satisfaction from the relief of those terrors she had of being overtaken by her father, that the arrival of the French scarce made any impression on her. She gently chid her maid for the fright into which she had thrown her, and said "she was glad it was no worse; for that she had feared somebody else was come."
"Ay, ay," quoth the landlord, smiling, "her ladyship knows better things; she knows the French are our very best friends, and come over hither only for our good. They are the people who are to make Old England flourish again. I warrant her honour thought the duke was coming; and that was enough to put her into a fright. I was going to tell your ladyship the news.一His honour's majesty, Heaven bless him, hath given the duke the slip, and is marching as fast as he can to London, and ten thousand French are landed to join him on the road."
Sophia was not greatly pleased with this news, nor with the gentleman who related it; but, as she still imagined he knew her (for she could not possibly have any suspicion of the real truth), she durst not show any dislike. And now the landlord, having removed the cloth from the table, withdrew; but at his departure frequently repeated his hopes of being remembered hereafter.
The mind of Sophia was not at all easy under the supposition of being known at this house; for she still applied to herself many things which the landlord had addressed to Jenny Cameron; she therefore ordered her maid to pump out of him by what means he had become acquainted
529
with her person, and who had offered him the reward for betraying her; she likewise ordered the horses to be in readiness by four in the morning, at which hour Mrs Fitzpatrick promised to bear her company; and then, composing herself as well as she could, she desired that lady to continue her story.

Chapter /
In which Mrs Fitzpatrick concludes her history.
While Mrs Honour, in pursuance of the commands of her mistress, ordered a bowl of punch, and invited my landlord and landlady to partake of it, Mrs Fitzpatrick thus went on with her relation.
"Most of the officers who were quartered at a town in our neighbourhood were of my husband's acquaintance. Among these there was a lieutenant, a very pretty sort of man, and who was married to a woman, so agreeable both in her temper and conversation, that from our first knowing each other, which was soon after my lying-in, we were almost inseparable companions; for I had the good fortune to make myself equally agreeable to her.
"The lieutenant, who was neither a sot nor a sportsman, was frequently of our parties; indeed he was very little with my husband, and no more than good breeding constrained him to be, as he lived almost constantly at our house. My husband often expressed much dissatisfaction at the lieutenant's preferring my company to his; he was very angry with me on that account, and gave me many a hearty curse for drawing away his companions; saying, 'I ought to be d一n'd for having spoiled one of the prettiest fellows in the world, by making a milksop of him.'
"You will be mistaken, my dear Sophia, if you imagine that the anger of my husband arose from my depriving him of a companion; for the lieutenant was not a person with whose society a fool could be pleased; and, if I should admit the possibility of this, so little right had my husband to place the loss of his companion to me, that I am convinced it was my conversation alone which induced him ever to come to the house. No, child, it was envy, the worst and most rancorous kind of envy, the envy of superiority of understanding. The wretch could not bear to see my conversation preferred to his, by a man of whom he could not entertain the least jealousy. O my dear Sophy, you are a woman of sense; if you marry a man, as is most probable you will, of less capacity than
531
yourself, make frequent trials of his temper before marriage, and see whether he can bear to submit to such a superiority.一Promise me, Sophy, you will take this advice; for you will hereafter find its importance." "It is very likely I shall never marry at all," answered Sophia; "I think, at least, I shall never marry a man in whose understanding I see any defects before marriage; and I promise you I would rather give up my own than see any such afterwards." "Give up your understanding!" replied Mrs Fitzpatrick; "oh, fie, child! I will not believe so meanly of you. Everything else I might myself be brought to give up; but never this. Nature would not have allotted this superiority to the wife in so many instances, if she had intended we should all of us have surrendered it to the husband. This, indeed, men of sense never expect of us; of which the lieutenant I have just mentioned was one notable example; for though he had a very good understanding, he always acknowledged (as was really true) that his wife had a better. And this, perhaps, was one reason of the hatred my tyrant bore her.
"Before he would be so governed by a wife, he said, especially such an ugly b一 (for, indeed, she was not a regular beauty, but very agreeable and extremely genteel), he would see all the women upon earth at the devil, which was a very usual phrase with him. He said, he wondered what I could see in her to be so charmed with her company: since this woman, says he, hath come among us, there is an end of your beloved reading, which you pretended to like so much, that you could not afford time to return the visits of the ladies in this country; and I must confess I had been guilty of a little rudeness this way; for the ladies there are at least no better than the mere country ladies here; and I think I need make no other excuse to you for declining any intimacy with them.
"This correspondence, however, continued a whole year, even all the while the lieutenant was quartered in that town; for which I was contented to pay the tax of being constantly abused in the manner above mentioned by my husband; I mean when he was at home; for he was frequently absent a month at a time at Dublin, and once made a journey of two months to London: in all which journeys I thought it a very singular happiness that he never once desired my company; nay, by his frequent censures on men who could not travel, as he phrased it, without a wife tied up to their tail, he sufficiently intimated that, had I been never so desirous of accompanying him, my wishes would have been in vain; but, Heaven knows, such wishes were very far from my thoughts.
"At length my friend was removed from me, and I was again left to my solitude, to the tormenting conversation with my own reflections, and to
532
apply to books for my only comfort. I now read almost all day long. How many books do you think I read in three months?" "I can't guess, indeed, cousin," answered Sophia. "Perhaps half a score." "Half a score! half a thousand, child!" answered the other. "I read a good deal in Daniel's English History of France; a great deal in Plutarch's Lives, the Atalantis, Pope's Homer, Dryden's Plays, Chillingworth, the Countess D'Aulnois, and Locke's Human Understanding.
"During this interval I wrote three very supplicating, and, I thought, moving letters to my aunt; but, as I received no answer to any of them, my disdain would not suffer me to continue my application." Here she stopt, and, looking earnestly at Sophia, said, "Methinks, my dear, I read something in your eyes which reproaches me of a neglect in another place, where I should have met with a kinder return." "Indeed, dear Harriet," answered Sophia, "your story is an apology for any neglect; but, indeed, I feel that I have been guilty of a remissness, without so good an excuse.一Yet pray proceed; for I long, though I tremble, to hear the end."
Thus, then, Mrs Fitzpatrick resumed her narrative:一"My husband now took a second journey to England, where he continued upwards of three months; during the greater part of this time I led a life which nothing but having led a worse could make me think tolerable; for perfect solitude can never be reconciled to a social mind, like mine, but when it relieves you from the company of those you hate. What added to my wretchedness was the loss of my little infant: not that I pretend to have had for it that extravagant tenderness of which I believe I might have been capable under other circumstances; but I resolved, in every instance, to discharge the duty of the tenderest mother; and this care prevented me from feeling the weight of that heaviest of all things, when it can be at all said to lie heavy on our hands.
"I had spent full ten weeks almost entirely by myself, having seen nobody all that time, except my servants and a very few visitors, when a young lady, a relation to my husband, came from a distant part of Ireland to visit me. She had staid once before a week at my house, and then I gave her a pressing invitation to return; for she was a very agreeable woman, and had improved good natural parts by a proper education. Indeed, she was to me a welcome guest.
"A few days after her arrival, perceiving me in very low spirits, without enquiring the cause, which, indeed, she very well knew, the young lady fell to compassionating my case. She said, 'Though politeness had prevented me from complaining to my husband's relations of
533
his behaviour, yet they all were very sensible of it, and felt great concern upon that account; but none more than herself.' And after some more general discourse on this head, which I own I could not forbear countenancing, at last, after much previous precaution and enjoined concealment, she communicated to me, as a profound secret一that my husband kept a mistress.
"You will certainly imagine I heard this news with the utmost insensibility—Upon my word, if you do, your imagination will mislead you. Contempt had not so kept down my anger to my husband, but that hatred rose again on this occasion. What can be the reason of this? Are we so abominably selfish, that we can be concerned at others having possession even of what we despise? Or are we not rather abominably vain, and is not this the greatest injury done to our vanity? What think you, Sophia?"
"I don't know, indeed," answered Sophia; "I have never troubled myself with any of these deep contemplations; but I think the lady did very ill in communicating to you such a secret."
"And yet, my dear, this conduct is natural," replied Mrs Fitzpatrick; "and, when you have seen and read as much as myself, you will acknowledge it to be so."
"I am sorry to hear it is natural," returned Sophia; "for I want neither reading nor experience to convince me that it is very dishonourable and very ill-natured: nay, it is surely as ill-bred to tell a husband or wife of the faults of each other as to tell them of their own."
"Well," continued Mrs Fitzpatrick, "my husband at last returned; and, if I am thoroughly acquainted with my own thoughts, I hated him now more than ever; but I despised him rather less: for certainly nothing so much weakens our contempt, as an injury done to our pride or our vanity.
"He now assumed a carriage to me so very different from what he had lately worn, and so nearly resembling his behaviour the first week of our marriage, that, had I now had any spark of love remaining, he might, possibly, have rekindled my fondness for him. But, though hatred may succeed to contempt, and may perhaps get the better of it, love, I believe, cannot. The truth is, the passion of love is too restless to remain contented without the gratification which it receives from its object; and one can no more be inclined to love without loving than we can have eyes without seeing. When a husband, therefore, ceases to be the object of this passion, it is most probable some other man—I say, my dear, if your
534
husband grows indifferent to you一if you once come to despise him—I say一that is一if you have the passion of love in you一Lud! I have bewildered myself so—but one is apt, in these abstracted considerations, to lose the concatenation of ideas, as Mr Locke says:一in short, the truth is一in short, I scarce know what it is; but, as I was saying, my husband returned, and his behaviour, at first, greatly surprized me; but he soon acquainted me with the motive, and taught me to account for it. In a word, then, he had spent and lost all the ready money of my fortune; and, as he could mortgage his own estate no deeper, he was now desirous to supply himself with cash for his extravagance, by selling a little estate of mine, which he could not do without my assistance; and to obtain this favour was the whole and sole motive of all the fondness which he now put on.
"With this I peremptorily refused to comply. I told him, and I told him truly, that, had I been possessed of the Indies at our first marriage, he might have commanded it all; for it had been a constant maxim with me, that where a woman disposes of her heart, she should always deposit her fortune; but, as he had been so kind, long ago, to restore the former into my possession, I was resolved likewise to retain what little remained of the latter.
"I will not describe to you the passion into which these words, and the resolute air in which they were spoken, threw him: nor will I trouble you with the whole scene which succeeded between us. Out came, you may be well assured, the story of the mistress; and out it did come, with all the embellishments which anger and disdain could bestow upon it.
"Mr Fitzpatrick seemed a little thunderstruck with this, and more confused than I had seen him, though his ideas are always confused enough, heaven knows. He did not, however, endeavour to exculpate himself; but took a method which almost equally confounded me. What was this but recrimination? He affected to be jealous:—he may, for aught I know, be inclined enough to jealousy in his natural temper; nay, he must have had it from nature, or the devil must have put it into his head; for I defy all the world to cast a just aspersion on my character: nay, the most scandalous tongues have never dared censure my reputation. My fame, I thank heaven, hath been always as spotless as my life; and let falsehood itself accuse that if it dare. No, my dear Graveairs, however provoked, however ill-treated, however injured in my love, I have firmly resolved never to give the least room for censure on this account.一And yet, my dear, there are some people so malicious, some tongues so venomous, that no innocence can escape them. The most undesigned word, the most
535
accidental look, the least familiarity, the most innocent freedom, will be misconstrued, and magnified into I know not what, by some people. But I despise, my dear Graveairs, I despise all such slander. No such malice, I assure you, ever gave me an uneasy moment. No, no, I promise you I am above all that.一But where was I? O let me see, I told you my husband was jealous一And of whom, I pray?一Why, of whom but the lieutenant I mentioned to you before! He was obliged to resort above a year and more back to find any object for this unaccountable passion, if, indeed, he really felt any such, and was not an arrant counterfeit in order to abuse me.
"But I have tired you already with too many particulars. I will now bring my story to a very speedy conclusion. In short, then, after many scenes very unworthy to be repeated, in which my cousin engaged so heartily on my side, that Mr Fitzpatrick at last turned her out of doors; when he found I was neither to be soothed nor bullied into compliance, he took a very violent method indeed. Perhaps you will conclude he beat me; but this, though he hath approached very near to it, he never actually did. He confined me to my room, without suffering me to have either pen, ink, paper, or book: and a servant every day made my bed, and brought me my food.
"When I had remained a week under this imprisonment, he made me a visit, and, with the voice of a schoolmaster, or, what is often much the same, of a tyrant, asked me, 'If I would yet comply?' I answered, very stoutly, 'That I would die first.' 'Then so you shall, and be d一nd!' cries he; 'for you shall never go alive out of this room.'
"Here I remained a fortnight longer; and, to say the truth, my constancy was almost subdued, and I began to think of submission; when, one day, in the absence of my husband, who was gone abroad for some short time, by the greatest good fortune in the world, an accident happened.一I一at a time when I began to give way to the utmost despair----everything would be excusable at such a time—at that very time
I received---But it would take up an hour to tell you all particulars.—In
one word, then (for I will not tire you with circumstances), gold, the common key to all padlocks, opened my door, and set me at liberty.
"I now made haste to Dublin, where I immediately procured a passage to England; and was proceeding to Bath, in order to throw myself into the protection of my aunt, or of your father, or of any relation who would afford it me. My husband overtook me last night at the inn where
536
I lay, and which you left a few minutes before me; but I had the good luck to escape him, and to follow you.
"And thus, my dear, ends my history: a tragical one, I am sure, it is to myself; but, perhaps, I ought rather to apologize to you for its dullness."
Sophia heaved a deep sigh, and answered, "Indeed, Harriet, I pity you from my soul!-----But what could you expect? Why, why, would you
marry an Irishman?"
"Upon my word," replied her cousin, "your censure is unjust. There are, among the Irish, men of as much worth and honour as any among the English: nay, to speak the truth, generosity of spirit is rather more common among them. I have known some examples there, too, of good husbands; and I believe these are not very plenty in England. Ask me, rather, what I could expect when I married a fool; and I will tell you a solemn truth; I did not know him to be so."一"Can no man," said Sophia, in a very low and altered voice, "do you think, make a bad husband, who is not a fool?" "That," answered the other, "is too general a negative; but none, I believe, is so likely as a fool to prove so. Among my acquaintance, the silliest fellows are the worst husbands; and I will venture to assert, as a fact, that a man of sense rarely behaves very ill to a wife who deserves very well."

Chapter V?
A dreadful alarm in the inn, with the arrival of an unexpected friend of Mrs Fitzpatrick.
Sophia now, at the desire of her cousin, related一not what follows, but what hath gone before in this history: for which reason the reader will, I suppose, excuse me for not repeating it over again.
One remark, however, I cannot forbear making on her narrative, namely, that she made no more mention of Jones, from the beginning to the end, than if there had been no such person alive. This I will neither endeavour to account for nor to excuse. Indeed, if this may be called a kind of dishonesty, it seems the more inexcusable, from the apparent openness and explicit sincerity of the other lady.—But so it was.
Just as Sophia arrived at the conclusion of her story, there arrived in the room where the two ladies were sitting a noise, not unlike, in loudness, to that of a pack of hounds just let out from their kennel; nor, in shrillness, to cats, when caterwauling; or to screech owls; or, indeed, more like (for what animal can resemble a human voice?) to those sounds which, in the pleasant mansions of that gate which seems to derive its name from a duplicity of tongues, issue from the mouths, and sometimes from the nostrils, of those fair river nymphs, ycleped of old the Naiades; in the vulgar tongue translated oyster-wenches; for when, instead of the antient libations of milk and honey and oil, the rich distillation from the juniper-berry, or, perhaps, from malt, hath, by the early devotion of their votaries, been poured forth in great abundance, should any daring tongue with unhallowed license prophane, i.e., depreciate, the delicate fat Milton oyster, the plaice sound and firm, the flounder as much alive as when in the water, the shrimp as big as a prawn, the fine cod alive but a few hours ago, or any other of the various treasures which those water-deities who fish the sea and rivers have committed to the care of the nymphs, the angry Naiades lift up their immortal voices, and the prophane wretch is struck deaf for his impiety.
538
Such was the noise which now burst from one of the rooms below; and soon the thunder, which long had rattled at a distance, began to approach nearer and nearer, till, having ascended by degrees upstairs, it at last entered the apartment where the ladies were. In short, to drop all metaphor and figure, Mrs Honour, having scolded violently below-stairs, and continued the same all the way up, came in to her mistress in a most outrageous passion, crying out, "What doth your ladyship think? Would you imagine that this impudent villain, the master of this house, hath had the impudence to tell me, nay, to stand it out to my face, that your ladyship is that nasty, stinking wh—re (Jenny Cameron they call her), that runs about the country with the Pretender? Nay, the lying, saucy villain had the assurance to tell me that your ladyship had owned yourself to be so; but I have clawed the rascal; I have left the marks of my nails in his impudent face. My lady! says I, you saucy scoundrel; my lady is meat for no pretenders. She is a young lady of as good fashion, and family, and fortune, as any in Somersetshire. Did you never hear of the great Squire Western, sirrah? She is his only daughter; she is-----,
and heiress to all his great estate. My lady to be called a nasty Scotch wh一re by such a varlet!一To be sure I wish I had knocked his brains out with the punch-bowl."
The principal uneasiness with which Sophia was affected on this occasion Honour had herself caused, by having in her passion discovered who she was. However, as this mistake of the landlord sufficiently accounted for those passages which Sophia had before mistaken, she acquired some ease on that account; nor could she, upon the whole, forbear smiling. This enraged Honour, and she cried, "Indeed, madam, I did not think your ladyship would have made a laughing matter of it. To be called whore by such an impudent low rascal. Your ladyship may be angry with me, for aught I know, for taking your part, since proffered service, they say, stinks; but to be sure I could never bear to hear a lady of mine called whore.一Nor will I bear it. I am sure your ladyship is as virtuous a lady as ever sat foot on English ground, and I will claw any villain's eyes out who dares for to offer to presume for to say the least word to the contrary. Nobody ever could say the least ill of the character of any lady that ever I waited upon."
Hinc illae lachrymae; in plain truth, Honour had as much love for her mistress as most servants have, that is to say一But besides this, her pride obliged her to support the character of the lady she waited on; for she thought her own was in a very close manner connected with it. In proportion as the character of her mistress was raised, hers likewise, as she
539
conceived, was raised with it; and, on the contrary, she thought the one could not be lowered without the other.
On this subject, reader, I must stop a moment, to tell thee a story. "The famous Nell Gwynn, stepping one day, from a house where she had made a short visit, into her coach, saw a great mob assembled, and her footman all bloody and dirty; the fellow, being asked by his mistress the reason of his being in that condition, answered, 'I have been fighting, madam, with an impudent rascal who called your ladyship a wh一re.' 'You blockhead,' replied Mrs Gwynn, 'at this rate you must fight every day of your life; why, you fool, all the world knows it.' 'Do they?' cries the fellow, in a muttering voice, after he had shut the coach-door, 'they shan't call me a whore's footman for all that.'"
Thus the passion of Mrs Honour appears natural enough, even if it were to be no otherwise accounted for; but, in reality, there was another cause of her anger; for which we must beg leave to remind our reader of a circumstance mentioned in the above simile. There are indeed certain liquors, which, being applied to our passions, or to fire, produce effects the very reverse of those produced by water, as they serve to kindle and inflame, rather than to extinguish. Among these, the generous liquor called punch is one. It was not, therefore, without reason, that the learned Dr Cheney used to call drinking punch pouring liquid fire down your throat.
Now, Mrs Honour had unluckily poured so much of this liquid fire down her throat, that the smoke of it began to ascend into her pericranium and blinded the eyes of Reason, which is there supposed to keep her residence, while the fire itself from the stomach easily reached the heart, and there inflamed the noble passion of pride. So that, upon the whole, we shall cease to wonder at the violent rage of the waiting-woman; though at first sight we must confess the cause seems inadequate to the effect.
Sophia and her cousin both did all in their power to extinguish these flames which had roared so loudly all over the house. They at length prevailed; or, to carry the metaphor one step farther, the fire, having consumed all the fuel which the language affords, to wit, every reproachful term in it, at last went out of its own accord.
But, though tranquillity was restored above-stairs, it was not so below; where my landlady, highly resenting the injury done to the beauty of her husband by the flesh-spades of Mrs Honour, called aloud for revenge and justice. As to the poor man, who had principally suffered in the
540
engagement, he was perfectly quiet. Perhaps the blood which he lost might have cooled his anger: for the enemy had not only applied her nails to his cheeks, but likewise her fist to his nostrils, which lamented the blow with tears of blood in great abundance. To this we may add reflections on his mistake; but indeed nothing so effectually silenced his resentment as the manner in which he now discovered his error; for as to the behaviour of Mrs Honour, it had the more confirmed him in his opinion; but he was now assured by a person of great figure, and who was attended by a great equipage, that one of the ladies was a woman of fashion, and his intimate acquaintance.
By the orders of this person, the landlord now ascended, and acquainted our fair travellers that a great gentleman below desired to do them the honour of waiting on them. Sophia turned pale and trembled at this message, though the reader will conclude it was too civil, notwithstanding the landlord's blunder, to have come from her father; but fear hath the common fault of a justice of peace, and is apt to conclude hastily from every slight circumstance, without examining the evidence on both sides.
To ease the reader's curiosity, therefore, rather than his apprehensions, we proceed to inform him that an Irish peer had arrived very late that evening at the inn, in his way to London. This nobleman, having sallied from his supper at the hurricane before commemorated, had seen the attendant of Mrs Fitzpatrick, and upon a short enquiry, was informed that her lady, with whom he was very particularly acquainted, was above. This information he had no sooner received than he addressed himself to the landlord, pacified him, and sent him upstairs with compliments rather civiller than those which were delivered.
It may perhaps be wondered at that the waiting-woman herself was not the messenger employed on this occasion; but we are sorry to say she was not at present qualified for that, or indeed for any other office. The rum (for so the landlord chose to call the distillation from malt) had basely taken the advantage of the fatigue which the poor woman had undergone, and had made terrible depredations on her noble faculties, at a time when they were very unable to resist the attack.
We shall not describe this tragical scene too fully; but we thought ourselves obliged, by that historic integrity which we profess, shortly to hint a matter which we would otherwise have been glad to have spared. Many historians, indeed, for want of this integrity, or of diligence, to say
541
no worse, often leave the reader to find out these little circumstances in the dark, and sometimes to his great confusion and perplexity.
Sophia was very soon eased of her causeless fright by the entry of the noble peer, who was not only an intimate acquaintance of Mrs Fitzpatrick, but in reality a very particular friend of that lady. To say truth, it was by his assistance that she had been enabled to escape from her husband; for this nobleman had the same gallant disposition with those renowned knights of whom we read in heroic story, and had delivered many an imprisoned nymph from durance. He was indeed as bitter an enemy to the savage authority too often exercised by husbands and fathers, over the young and lovely of the other sex, as ever knight-errant was to the barbarous power of enchanters; nay, to say truth, I have often suspected that those very enchanters with which romance everywhere abounds were in reality no other than the husbands of those days; and matrimony itself was, perhaps, the enchanted castle in which the nymphs were said to be confined.
This nobleman had an estate in the neighbourhood of Fitzpatrick, and had been for some time acquainted with the lady. No sooner, therefore, did he hear of her confinement, than he earnestly applied himself to procure her liberty; which he presently effected, not by storming the castle, according to the example of antient heroes, but by corrupting the governor, in conformity with the modern art of war, in which craft is held to be preferable to valour, and gold is found to be more irresistible than either lead or steel.
This circumstance, however, as the lady did not think it material enough to relate to her friend, we would not at that time impart it to the reader. We rather chose to leave him a while under a supposition that she had found, or coined, or by some very extraordinary, perhaps supernatural means, had possessed herself of the money with which she had bribed her keeper, than to interrupt her narrative by giving a hint of what seemed to her of too little importance to be mentioned.
The peer, after a short conversation, could not forbear expressing some surprize at meeting the lady in that place; nor could he refrain from telling her he imagined she had been gone to Bath. Mrs Fitzpatrick very freely answered, "That she had been prevented in her purpose by the arrival of a person she need not mention. In short," says she, "I was overtaken by my husband (for I need not affect to conceal what the world knows too well already). I had the good fortune to escape in a most surprizing manner, and am now going to London with this young lady,
542
who is a near relation of mine, and who hath escaped from as great a tyrant as my own."
His lordship, concluding that this tyrant was likewise a husband, made a speech full of compliments to both the ladies, and as full of invectives against his own sex; nor indeed did he avoid some oblique glances at the matrimonial institution itself, and at the unjust powers given by it to man over the more sensible and more meritorious part of the species. He ended his oration with an offer of his protection, and of his coach and six, which was instantly accepted by Mrs Fitzpatrick, and at last, upon her persuasions, by Sophia.
Matters being thus adjusted, his lordship took his leave, and the ladies retired to rest, where Mrs Fitzpatrick entertained her cousin with many high encomiums on the character of the noble peer, and enlarged very particularly on his great fondness for his wife; saying, she believed he was almost the only person of high rank who was entirely constant to the marriage bed. "Indeed," added she, "my dear Sophy, that is a very rare virtue amongst men of condition. Never expect it when you marry; for, believe me, if you do, you will certainly be deceived."
A gentle sigh stole from Sophia at these words, which perhaps contributed to form a dream of no very pleasant kind; but, as she never revealed this dream to any one, so the reader cannot expect to see it related here.

Chapter J
The morning introduced in some pretty writing. A stagecoach. The civility of chambermaids. The heroic temper of Sophia. Her generosity. The return to it. The departure of the company, and their arrival at London; with some remarks for the use of travellers.
Those members of society who are born to furnish the blessings of life now began to light their candles, in order to pursue their daily labours for the use of those who are born to enjoy these blessings. The sturdy hind now attends the levee of his fellow-labourer the ox; the cunning artificer, the diligent mechanic, spring from their hard mattress; and now the bonny housemaid begins to repair the disordered drum-room, while the riotous authors of that disorder, in broken interrupted slumbers, tumble and toss, as if the hardness of down disquieted their repose.
In simple phrase, the clock had no sooner struck seven than the ladies were ready for their journey; and, at their desire, his lordship and his equipage were prepared to attend them.
And now a matter of some difficulty arose; and this was how his lordship himself should be conveyed; for though in stage-coaches, where passengers are properly considered as so much luggage, the ingenious coachman stows half a dozen with perfect ease into the place of four; for well he contrives that the fat hostess, or well-fed alderman, may take up no more room than the slim miss, or taper master; it being the nature of guts, when well squeezed, to give way, and to lie in a narrow compass; yet in these vehicles, which are called, for distinction's sake, gentlemen's coaches, though they are often larger than the others, this method of packing is never attempted.
His lordship would have put a short end to the difficulty, by very gallantly desiring to mount his horse; but Mrs Fitzpatrick would by no means consent to it. It was therefore concluded that the Abigails should, by turns, relieve each other on one of his lordship's horses, which was presently equipped with a side-saddle for that purpose.
544
Everything being settled at the inn, the ladies discharged their former guides, and Sophia made a present to the landlord, partly to repair the bruise which he had received under herself, and partly on account of what he had suffered under the hands of her enraged waiting-woman. And now Sophia first discovered a loss which gave her some uneasiness; and this was of the hundred-pound bank-bill which her father had given her at their last meeting; and which, within a very inconsiderable trifle, was all the treasure she was at present worth. She searched everywhere, and shook and tumbled all her things to no purpose, the bill was not to be found: and she was at last fully persuaded that she had lost it from her pocket when she had the misfortune of tumbling from her horse in the dark lane, as before recorded: a fact that seemed the more probable, as she now recollected some discomposure in her pockets which had happened at that time, and the great difficulty with which she had drawn forth her handkerchief the very instant before her fall, in order to relieve the distress of Mrs Fitzpatrick.
Misfortunes of this kind, whatever inconveniencies they may be attended with, are incapable of subduing a mind in which there is any strength, without the assistance of avarice. Sophia, therefore, though nothing could be worse timed than this accident at such a season, immediately got the better of her concern, and, with her wonted serenity and cheerfulness of countenance, returned to her company. His lordship conducted the ladies into the vehicle, as he did likewise Mrs Honour, who, after many civilities, and more dear madams, at last yielded to the well-bred importunities of her sister Abigail, and submitted to be complimented with the first ride in the coach; in which indeed she would afterwards have been contented to have pursued her whole journey, had not her mistress, after several fruitless intimations, at length forced her to take her turn on horseback.
The coach, now having received its company, began to move forwards, attended by many servants, and led by two captains, who had before rode with his lordship, and who would have been dismissed from the vehicle upon a much less worthy occasion than was this of accommodating two ladies. In this they acted only as gentlemen; but they were ready at any time to have performed the office of a footman, or indeed would have condescended lower, for the honour of his lordship's company, and for the convenience of his table.
My landlord was so pleased with the present he had received from Sophia, that he rather rejoiced in than regretted his bruise or his scratches. The reader will perhaps be curious to know the quantum of this
545
present; but we cannot satisfy his curiosity. Whatever it was, it satisfied the landlord for his bodily hurt; but he lamented he had not known before how little the lady valued her money; "For to be sure," says he, "one might have charged every article double, and she would have made no cavil at the reckoning."
His wife, however, was far from drawing this conclusion; whether she really felt any injury done to her husband more than he did himself, I will not say: certain it is, she was much less satisfied with the generosity of Sophia. "Indeed," cries she, "my dear, the lady knows better how to dispose of her money than you imagine. She might very well think we should not put up such a business without some satisfaction, and the law would have cost her an infinite deal more than this poor little matter, which I wonder you would take." "You are always so bloodily wise," quoth the husband: "it would have cost her more, would it? dost fancy I don't know that as well as thee? but would any of that more, or so much, have come into our pockets? Indeed, if son Tom the lawyer had been alive, I could have been glad to have put such a pretty business into his hands. He would have got a good picking out of it; but I have no relation now who is a lawyer, and why should I go to law for the benefit of strangers?" "Nay, to be sure," answered she, "you must know best." "I believe I do," replied he. "I fancy, when money is to be got, I can smell it out as well as another. Everybody, let me tell you, would not have talked people out of this. Mind that, I say; everybody would not have cajoled this out of her, mind that." The wife then joined in the applause of her husband's sagacity; and thus ended the short dialogue between them on this occasion.
We will therefore take our leave of these good people, and attend his lordship and his fair companions, who made such good expedition that they performed a journey of ninety miles in two days, and on the second evening arrived in London, without having encountered any one adventure on the road worthy the dignity of this history to relate. Our pen, therefore, shall imitate the expedition which it describes, and our history shall keep pace with the travellers who are its subject. Good writers will, indeed, do well to imitate the ingenious traveller in this instance, who always proportions his stay at any place to the beauties, elegancies, and curiosities which it affords. At Eshur, at Stowe, at Wilton, at Eastbury, and at Prior's Park, days are too short for the ravished imagination; while we admire the wondrous power of art in improving nature. In some of these, art chiefly engages our admiration; in others, nature and art contend for our applause; but, in the last, the former seems to
546
triumph. Here Nature appears in her richest attire, and Art, dressed with the modestest simplicity, attends her benignant mistress. Here Nature indeed pours forth the choicest treasures which she hath lavished on this world; and here human nature presents you with an object which can be exceeded only in the other.
The same taste, the same imagination, which luxuriously riots in these elegant scenes, can be amused with objects of far inferior note. The woods, the rivers, the lawns of Devon and of Dorset, attract the eye of the ingenious traveller, and retard his pace, which delay he afterwards compensates by swiftly scouring over the gloomy heath of Bagshot, or that pleasant plain which extends itself westward from Stockbridge, where no other object than one single tree only in sixteen miles presents itself to the view, unless the clouds, in compassion to our tired spirits, kindly open their variegated mansions to our prospect.
Not so travels the money-meditating tradesman, the sagacious justice, the dignified doctor, the warm-clad grazier, with all the numerous offspring of wealth and dulness. On they jog, with equal pace, through the verdant meadows or over the barren heath, their horses measuring four miles and a half per hour with the utmost exactness; the eyes of the beast and of his master being alike directed forwards, and employed in contemplating the same objects in the same manner. With equal rapture the good rider surveys the proudest boasts of the architect, and those fair buildings with which some unknown name hath adorned the rich cloath-ing town; where heaps of bricks are piled up as a kind of monument to show that heaps of money have been piled there before.
And now, reader, as we are in haste to attend our heroine, we will leave to thy sagacity to apply all this to the Boeotian writers, and to those authors who are their opposites. This thou wilt be abundantly able to perform without our aid. Bestir thyself therefore on this occasion; for, though we will always lend thee proper assistance in difficult places, as we do not, like some others, expect thee to use the arts of divination to discover our meaning, yet we shall not indulge thy laziness where nothing but thy own attention is required; for thou art highly mistaken if thou dost imagine that we intended, when we began this great work, to leave thy sagacity nothing to do; or that, without sometimes exercising this talent, thou wilt be able to travel through our pages with any pleasure or profit to thyself.

Chapter A Vx
Containing a hint or two concerning virtue, and a few more concerning suspicion.
Our company, being arrived at London, were set down at his lordship's house, where, while they refreshed themselves after the fatigue of their journey, servants were despatched to provide a lodging for the two ladies; for, as her ladyship was not then in town, Mrs Fitzpatrick would by no means consent to accept a bed in the mansion of the peer.
Some readers will, perhaps, condemn this extraordinary delicacy, as I may call it, of virtue, as too nice and scrupulous; but we must make allowances for her situation, which must be owned to have been very ticklish; and, when we consider the malice of censorious tongues, we must allow, if it was a fault, the fault was an excess on the right side, and which every woman who is in the self-same situation will do well to imitate. The most formal appearance of virtue, when it is only an appearance, may, perhaps, in very abstracted considerations, seem to be rather less commendable than virtue itself without this formality; but it will, however, be always more commended; and this, I believe, will be granted by all, that it is necessary, unless in some very particular cases, for every woman to support either the one or the other.
A lodging being prepared, Sophia accompanied her cousin for that evening; but resolved early in the morning to enquire after the lady into whose protection, as we have formerly mentioned, she had determined to throw herself when she quitted her father's house. And this she was the more eager in doing from some observations she had made during her journey in the coach.
Now, as we would by no means fix the odious character of suspicion on Sophia, we are almost afraid to open to our reader the conceits which filled her mind concerning Mrs Fitzpatrick; of whom she certainly entertained at present some doubts; which, as they are very apt to enter into the bosoms of the worst of people, we think proper not to mention more
548
plainly till we have first suggested a word or two to our reader touching suspicion in general.
Of this there have always appeared to me to be two degrees. The first of these I chuse to derive from the heart, as the extreme velocity of its discernment seems to denote some previous inward impulse, and the rather as this superlative degree often forms its own objects; sees what is not, and always more than really exists. This is that quick-sighted penetration whose hawk's eyes no symptom of evil can escape; which observes not only upon the actions, but upon the words and looks, of men; and, as it proceeds from the heart of the observer, so it dives into the heart of the observed, and there espies evil, as it were, in the first embryo; nay, sometimes before it can be said to be conceived. An admirable faculty, if it were infallible; but, as this degree of perfection is not even claimed by more than one mortal being; so from the fallibility of such acute discernment have arisen many sad mischiefs and most grievous heart-aches to innocence and virtue. I cannot help, therefore, regarding this vast quick-sightedness into evil as a vicious excess, and as a very pernicious evil in itself. And I am the more inclined to this opinion, as I am afraid it always proceeds from a bad heart, for the reasons I have above mentioned, and for one more, namely, because I never knew it the property of a good one. Now, from this degree of suspicion I entirely and absolutely acquit Sophia.
A second degree of this quality seems to arise from the head. This is, indeed, no other than the faculty of seeing what is before your eyes, and of drawing conclusions from what you see. The former of these is unavoidable by those who have any eyes, and the latter is perhaps no less certain and necessary a consequence of our having any brains. This is altogether as bitter an enemy to guilt as the former is to innocence: nor can I see it in an unamiable light, even though, through human fallibility, it should be sometimes mistaken. For instance, if a husband should accidentally surprize his wife in the lap or in the embraces of some of those pretty young gentlemen who profess the art of cuckold-making, I should not highly, I think, blame him for concluding something more than what he saw, from the familiarities which he really had seen, and which we are at least favourable enough to when we call them innocent freedoms. The reader will easily suggest great plenty of instances to himself; I shall add but one more, which, however unchristian it may be thought by some, I cannot help esteeming to be strictly justifiable; and this is a suspicion that a man is capable of doing what he hath done already, and that it is possible for one who hath been a villain once to act the same part
549
again. And, to confess the truth, of this degree of suspicion I believe Sophia was guilty. From this degree of suspicion she had, in fact, conceived an opinion that her cousin was really not better than she should be.
The case, it seems, was this: Mrs Fitzpatrick wisely considered that the virtue of a young lady is, in the world, in the same situation with a poor hare, which is certain, whenever it ventures abroad, to meet its enemies; for it can hardly meet any other. No sooner therefore was she determined to take the first opportunity of quitting the protection of her husband, than she resolved to cast herself under the protection of some other man; and whom could she so properly choose to be her guardian as a person of quality, of fortune, of honour; and who, besides a gallant disposition which inclines men to knight-errantry, that is, to be the champions of ladies in distress, had often declared a violent attachment to herself, and had already given her all the instances of it in his power?
But, as the law hath foolishly omitted this office of vice-husband, or guardian to an eloped lady, and as malice is apt to denominate him by a more disagreeable appellation, it was concluded that his lordship should perform all such kind offices to the lady in secret, and without publickly assuming the character of her protector. Nay, to prevent any other person from seeing him in this light, it was agreed that the lady should proceed directly to Bath, and that his lordship should first go to London, and thence should go down to that place by the advice of his physicians.
Now all this Sophia very plainly understood, not from the lips or behaviour of Mrs Fitzpatrick, but from the peer, who was infinitely less expert at retaining a secret than was the good lady; and perhaps the exact secrecy which Mrs Fitzpatrick had observed on this head in her narrative served not a little to heighten those suspicions which were now risen in the mind of her cousin.
Sophia very easily found out the lady she sought; for indeed there was not a chairman in town to whom her house was not perfectly well known; and, as she received, in return of her first message, a most pressing invitation, she immediately accepted it. Mrs Fitzpatrick, indeed, did not desire her cousin to stay with her with more earnestness than civility required. Whether she had discerned and resented the suspicion abovementioned, or from what other motive it arose, I cannot say; but certain it is, she was full as desirous of parting with Sophia as Sophia herself could be of going.
550
The young lady, when she came to take leave of her cousin, could not avoid giving her a short hint of advice. She begged her, for heaven's sake, to take care of herself, and to consider in how dangerous a situation she stood; adding, she hoped some method would be found of reconciling her to her husband. "You must remember, my dear," says she, "the maxim which my aunt Western hath so often repeated to us both; That whenever the matrimonial alliance is broke, and war declared between husband and wife, she can hardly make a disadvantageous peace for herself on any conditions. These are my aunt's very words, and she hath had a great deal of experience in the world." Mrs Fitzpatrick answered, with a contemptuous smile, "Never fear me, child, take care of yourself; for you are younger than I. I will come and visit you in a few days; but, dear Sophy, let me give you one piece of advice: leave the character of Graveairs in the country, for, believe me, it will sit very awkwardly upon you in this town."
Thus the two cousins parted, and Sophia repaired directly to Lady Bel-laston, where she found a most hearty, as well as a most polite, welcome. The lady had taken a great fancy to her when she had seen her formerly with her aunt Western. She was indeed extremely glad to see her, and was no sooner acquainted with the reasons which induced her to leave the squire and to fly to London than she highly applauded her sense and resolution; and after expressing the highest satisfaction in the opinion which Sophia had declared she entertained of her ladyship, by chusing her house for an asylum, she promised her all the protection which it was in her power to give.
As we have now brought Sophia into safe hands, the reader will, I apprehend, be contented to deposit her there a while, and to look a little after other personages, and particularly poor Jones, whom we have left long enough to do penance for his past offences, which, as is the nature of vice, brought sufficient punishment upon him themselves.

Chapter 且
Showing what is to be deemed plagiarism in a modern author, and what is to be considered as lawful prize.
The learned reader must have observed that in the course of this mighty work, I have often translated passages out of the best antient authors, without quoting the original, or without taking the least notice of the book from whence they were borrowed.
This conduct in writing is placed in a very proper light by the ingenious Abbe Bannier, in his preface to his Mythology, a work of great erudition and of equal judgment. "It will be easy," says he, "for the reader to observe that I have frequently had greater regard to him than to my own reputation: for an author certainly pays him a considerable compliment, when, for his sake, he suppresses learned quotations that come in his way, and which would have cost him but the bare trouble of transcribing."
To fill up a work with these scraps may, indeed, be considered as a downright cheat on the learned world, who are by such means imposed upon to buy a second time, in fragments and by retail, what they have already in gross, if not in their memories, upon their shelves; and it is still more cruel upon the illiterate, who are drawn in to pay for what is of no manner of use to them. A writer who intermixes great quantity of Greek and Latin with his works, deals by the ladies and fine gentlemen in the same paultry manner with which they are treated by the auctioneers, who often endeavour so to confound and mix up their lots, that, in order to purchase the commodity you want, you are obliged at the same time to purchase that which will do you no service.
And yet, as there is no conduct so fair and disinterested but that it may be misunderstood by ignorance, and misrepresented by malice, I have been sometimes tempted to preserve my own reputation at the expense of my reader, and to transcribe the original, or at least to quote chapter and verse, whenever I have made use either of the thought or expression
553
of another. I am, indeed, in some doubt that I have often suffered by the contrary method; and that, by suppressing the original author's name, I have been rather suspected of plagiarism than reputed to act from the amiable motive assigned by that justly celebrated Frenchman.
Now, to obviate all such imputations for the future, I do here confess and justify the fact. The antients may be considered as a rich common, where every person who hath the smallest tenement in Parnassus hath a free right to fatten his muse. Or, to place it in a clearer light, we moderns are to the antients what the poor are to the rich. By the poor here I mean that large and venerable body which, in English, we call the mob. Now, whoever hath had the honour to be admitted to any degree of intimacy with this mob, must well know that it is one of their established maxims to plunder and pillage their rich neighbours without any reluctance; and that this is held to be neither sin nor shame among them. And so constantly do they abide and act by this maxim, that, in every parish almost in the kingdom, there is a kind of confederacy ever carrying on against a certain person of opulence called the squire, whose property is considered as free-booty by all his poor neighbours; who, as they conclude that there is no manner of guilt in such depredations, look upon it as a point of honour and moral obligation to conceal, and to preserve each other from punishment on all such occasions.
In like manner are the antients, such as Homer, Virgil, Horace, Cicero, and the rest, to be esteemed among us writers, as so many wealthy squires, from whom we, the poor of Parnassus, claim an immemorial custom of taking whatever we can come at. This liberty I demand, and this I am as ready to allow again to my poor neighbours in their turn. All I profess, and all I require of my brethren, is to maintain the same strict honesty among ourselves which the mob show to one another. To steal from one another is indeed highly criminal and indecent; for this may be strictly stiled defrauding the poor (sometimes perhaps those who are poorer than ourselves), or, to set it under the most opprobrious colours, robbing the spittal.
Since, therefore, upon the strictest examination, my own conscience cannot lay any such pitiful theft to my charge, I am contented to plead guilty to the former accusation; nor shall I ever scruple to take to myself any passage which I shall find in an antient author to my purpose, without setting down the name of the author from whence it was taken. Nay, I absolutely claim a property in all such sentiments the moment they are transcribed into my writings, and I expect all readers hencefor-wards to regard them as purely and entirely my own. This claim,
554
however, I desire to be allowed me only on condition that I preserve strict honesty towards my poor brethren, from whom, if ever I borrow any of that little of which they are possessed, I shall never fail to put their mark upon it, that it may be at all times ready to be restored to the right owner.
The omission of this was highly blameable in one Mr Moore, who, having formerly borrowed some lines of Pope and company, took the liberty to transcribe six of them into his play of the Rival Modes. Mr Pope, however, very luckily found them in the said play, and, laying violent hands on his own property, transferred it back again into his own works; and, for a further punishment, imprisoned the said Moore in the loathsome dungeon of the Dunciad, where his unhappy memory now remains, and eternally will remain, as a proper punishment for such his unjust dealings in the poetical trade.

Chapter
In which, though the squire doth not find his daughter, something is found which puts an end to his pursuit.
The history now returns to the inn at Upton, whence we shall first trace the footsteps of Squire Western; for, as he will soon arrive at an end of his journey, we shall have then full leisure to attend our heroe.
The reader may be pleased to remember that the said squire departed from the inn in great fury, and in that fury he pursued his daughter. The hostler having informed him that she had crossed the Severn, he likewise past that river with his equipage, and rode full speed, vowing the utmost vengeance against poor Sophia, if he should but overtake her.
He had not gone far before he arrived at a crossway. Here he called a short council of war, in which, after hearing different opinions, he at last gave the direction of his pursuit to fortune, and struck directly into the Worcester road.
In this road he proceeded about two miles, when he began to bemoan himself most bitterly, frequently crying out, "What pity is it! Sure never was so unlucky a dog as myself!" And then burst forth a volley of oaths and execrations.
The parson attempted to administer comfort to him on this occasion. "Sorrow not, sir," says he, "like those without hope. Howbeit we have not yet been able to overtake young madam, we may account it some good fortune that we have hitherto traced her course aright. Peradventure she will soon be fatigated with her journey, and will tarry in some inn, in order to renovate her corporeal functions; and in that case, in all moral certainty, you will very briefly be compos voti."
"Pogh! d一n the slut!" answered the squire, "I am lamenting the loss of so fine a morning for hunting. It is confounded hard to lose one of the best scenting days, in all appearance, which hath been this season, and especially after so long a frost."
556
Whether Fortune, who now and then shows some compassion in her wantonest tricks, might not take pity of the squire; and, as she had determined not to let him overtake his daughter, might not resolve to make him amends some other way, I will not assert; but he had hardly uttered the words just before commemorated, and two or three oaths at their heels, when a pack of hounds began to open their melodious throats at a small distance from them, which the squire's horse and his rider both perceiving, both immediately pricked up their ears, and the squire, crying, "She's gone, she's gone! Damn me if she is not gone!" instantly clapped spurs to the beast, who little needed it, having indeed the same inclination with his master; and now the whole company, crossing into a corn-field, rode directly towards the hounds, with much hallowing and whooping, while the poor parson, blessing himself, brought up the rear.
Thus fable reports that the fair Grimalkin, whom Venus, at the desire of a passionate lover, converted from a cat into a fine woman, no sooner perceived a mouse than, mindful of her former sport, and still retaining her pristine nature, she leaped from the bed of her husband to pursue the little animal.
What are we to understand by this? Not that the bride was displeased with the embraces of her amorous bridegroom; for, though some have remarked that cats are subject to ingratitude, yet women and cats too will be pleased and purr on certain occasions. The truth is, as the sagacious Sir Roger L'Estrange observes, in his deep reflections, that, "if we shut Nature out at the door, she will come in at the window; and that puss, though a madam, will be a mouser still." In the same manner we are not to arraign the squire of any want of love for his daughter; for in reality he had a great deal; we are only to consider that he was a squire and a sportsman, and then we may apply the fable to him, and the judicious reflections likewise.
The hounds ran very hard, as it is called, and the squire pursued over hedge and ditch, with all his usual vociferation and alacrity, and with all his usual pleasure; nor did the thoughts of Sophia ever once intrude themselves to allay the satisfaction he enjoyed in the chace, which, he said, was one of the finest he ever saw, and which he swore was very well worth going fifty miles for. As the squire forgot his daughter, the servants, we may easily believe, forgot their mistress; and the parson, after having expressed much astonishment, in Latin, to himself, at length likewise abandoned all farther thoughts of the young lady, and, jogging on at a distance behind, began to meditate a portion of doctrine for the ensuing Sunday.
557
The squire who owned the hounds was highly pleased with the arrival of his brother squire and sportsman; for all men approve merit in their own way, and no man was more expert in the field than Mr Western, nor did any other better know how to encourage the dogs with his voice, and to animate the hunt with his holla.
Sportsmen, in the warmth of a chace, are too much engaged to attend to any manner of ceremony, nay, even to the offices of humanity: for, if any of them meet with an accident by tumbling into a ditch, or into a river, the rest pass on regardless, and generally leave him to his fate: during this time, therefore, the two squires, though often close to each other, interchanged not a single word. The master of the hunt, however, often saw and approved the great judgment of the stranger in drawing the dogs when they were at a fault, and hence conceived a very high opinion of his understanding, as the number of his attendants inspired no small reverence to his quality. As soon, therefore, as the sport was ended by the death of the little animal which had occasioned it, the two squires met, and in all squire-like greeting saluted each other.
The conversation was entertaining enough, and what we may perhaps relate in an appendix, or on some other occasion; but as it nowise concerns this history, we cannot prevail on ourselves to give it a place here. It concluded with a second chace, and that with an invitation to dinner. This being accepted, was followed by a hearty bout of drinking, which ended in as hearty a nap on the part of Squire Western.
Our squire was by no means a match either for his host, or for parson Supple, at his cups that evening; for which the violent fatigue of mind as well as body that he had undergone, may very well account, without the least derogation from his honour. He was indeed, according to the vulgar phrase, whistle drunk; for before he had swallowed the third bottle, he became so entirely overpowered that though he was not carried off to bed till long after, the parson considered him as absent, and having acquainted the other squire with all relating to Sophia, he obtained his promise of seconding those arguments which he intended to urge the next morning for Mr Western's return.
No sooner, therefore, had the good squire shaken off his evening, and began to call for his morning draught, and to summon his horses in order to renew his pursuit, than Mr Supple began his dissuasives, which the host so strongly seconded, that they at length prevailed, and Mr Western agreed to return home; being principally moved by one argument, viz., that he knew not which way to go, and might probably be
558
riding farther from his daughter instead of towards her. He then took leave of his brother sportsman, and expressing great joy that the frost was broken (which might perhaps be no small motive to his hastening home), set forwards, or rather backwards, for Somersetshire; but not before he had first despatched part of his retinue in quest of his daughter, after whom he likewise sent a volley of the most bitter execrations which he could invent.

Chapter U
The departure of Jones from Upton, with what passed between him and Partridge on the road.
At length we are once more come to our heroe; and, to say truth, we have been obliged to part with him so long, that, considering the condition in which we left him, I apprehend many of our readers have concluded we intended to abandon him for ever; he being at present in that situation in which prudent people usually desist from enquiring any farther after their friends, lest they should be shocked by hearing such friends had hanged themselves.
But, in reality, if we have not all the virtues, I will boldly say, neither have we all the vices of a prudent character; and though it is not easy to conceive circumstances much more miserable than those of poor Jones at present, we shall return to him, and attend upon him with the same diligence as if he was wantoning in the brightest beams of fortune.
Mr Jones, then, and his companion Partridge, left the inn a few minutes after the departure of Squire Western, and pursued the same road on foot, for the hostler told them that no horses were by any means to be at that time procured at Upton. On they marched with heavy hearts; for though their disquiet proceeded from very different reasons, yet displeased they were both; and if Jones sighed bitterly, Partridge grunted altogether as sadly at every step.
When they came to the cross-roads where the squire had stopt to take counsel, Jones stopt likewise, and turning to Partridge, asked his opinion which track they should pursue. "Ah, sir," answered Partridge, "I wish your honour would follow my advice." "Why should I not?" replied Jones; "for it is now indifferent to me whither I go, or what becomes of me." "My advice, then," said Partridge, "is, that you immediately face about and return home; for who that hath such a home to return to as your honour, would travel thus about the country like a vagabond? I ask pardon, sed vox ea sola reperta est.''
560
"Alas!" cries Jones, "I have no home to return to;—but if my friend, my father, would receive me, could I bear the country from which Sophia is flown? Cruel Sophia! Cruel! No; let me blame myself!一No; let me blame thee. D一nation seize thee一fool一blockhead! thou hast undone me, and I will tear thy soul from thy body."一At which words he laid violent hands on the collar of poor Partridge, and shook him more heartily than an ague-fit, or his own fears had ever done before.
Partridge fell trembling on his knees, and begged for mercy, vowing he had meant no harm一when Jones, after staring wildly on him for a moment, quitted his hold, and discharged a rage on himself, that, had it fallen on the other, would certainly have put an end to his being, which indeed the very apprehension of it had almost effected.
We would bestow some pains here in minutely describing all the mad pranks which Jones played on this occasion, could we be well assured that the reader would take the same pains in perusing them; but as we are apprehensive that, after all the labour which we should employ in painting this scene, the said reader would be very apt to skip it entirely over, we have saved ourselves that trouble. To say the truth, we have, from this reason alone, often done great violence to the luxuriance of our genius, and have left many excellent descriptions out of our work, which would otherwise have been in it. And this suspicion, to be honest, arises, as is generally the case, from our own wicked heart; for we have, ourselves, been very often most horridly given to jumping, as we have run through the pages of voluminous historians.
Suffice it then simply to say, that Jones, after having played the part of a madman for many minutes, came, by degrees, to himself; which no sooner happened, than, turning to Partridge, he very earnestly begged his pardon for the attack he had made on him in the violence of his passion; but concluded, by desiring him never to mention his return again; for he was resolved never to see that country any more.
Partridge easily forgave, and faithfully promised to obey the injunction now laid upon him. And then Jones very briskly cried out, "Since it is absolutely impossible for me to pursue any farther the steps of my an-gel一I will pursue those of glory. Come on, my brave lad, now for the army:一it is a glorious cause, and I would willingly sacrifice my life in it, even though it was worth my preserving." And so saying, he immediately struck into the different road from that which the squire had taken, and, by mere chance, pursued the very same through which Sophia had before passed.
561
Our travellers now marched a full mile, without speaking a syllable to each other, though Jones, indeed, muttered many things to himself. As to Partridge, he was profoundly silent; for he was not, perhaps, perfectly recovered from his former fright; besides, he had apprehensions of provoking his friend to a second fit of wrath, especially as he now began to entertain a conceit, which may not, perhaps, create any great wonder in the reader. In short, he began now to suspect that Jones was absolutely out of his senses.
At length, Jones, being weary of soliloquy, addressed himself to his companion, and blamed him for his taciturnity; for which the poor man very honestly accounted, from his fear of giving offence. And now this fear being pretty well removed, by the most absolute promises of indemnity, Partridge again took the bridle from his tongue; which, perhaps, rejoiced no less at regaining its liberty, than a young colt, when the bridle is slipt from his neck, and he is turned loose into the pastures.
As Partridge was inhibited from that topic which would have first suggested itself, he fell upon that which was next uppermost in his mind, namely, the Man of the Hill. "Certainly, sir," says he, "that could never be a man, who dresses himself and lives after such a strange manner, and so unlike other folks. Besides, his diet, as the old woman told me, is chiefly upon herbs, which is a fitter food for a horse than a Christian: nay, landlord at Upton says that the neighbours thereabouts have very fearful notions about him. It runs strangely in my head that it must have been some spirit, who, perhaps, might be sent to forewarn us: and who knows but all that matter which he told us, of his going to fight, and of his being taken prisoner, and of the great danger he was in of being hanged, might be intended as a warning to us, considering what we are going about? besides, I dreamt of nothing all last night but of fighting; and methought the blood ran out of my nose, as liquor out of a tap. Indeed, sir, infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem.''
"Thy story, Partridge," answered Jones, "is almost as ill applied as thy Latin. Nothing can be more likely to happen than death to men who go into battle. Perhaps we shall both fall in it一and what then?" "What then?" replied Partridge; "why then there is an end of us, is there not? when I am gone, all is over with me. What matters the cause to me, or who gets the victory, if I am killed? I shall never enjoy any advantage from it. What are all the ringing of bells, and bonfires, to one that is six foot under ground? there will be an end of poor Partridge." "And an end of poor Partridge," cries Jones, "there must be, one time or other. If you
562
love Latin, I will repeat you some fine lines out of Horace, which would inspire courage into a coward.
'Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori Mors et fugacem persequitur virum Nec parcit imbellis juventae Poplitibus, timidoque tergo."'
"I wish you would construe them," cries Partridge; "for Horace is a hard author, and I cannot understand as you repeat them.'
"I will repeat you a bad imitation, or rather paraphrase, of my own," said Jones; "for I am but an indifferent poet:
'Who would not die in his dear country's cause? Since, if base fear his dastard step withdraws, From death he cannot fly:一One common grave Receives, at last, the coward and the brave.'"
"That's very certain," cries Partridge. "Ay, sure, Mors omnibus communis: but there is a great difference between dying in one's bed a great many years hence, like a good Christian, with all our friends crying about us, and being shot to-day or to-morrow, like a mad dog; or, perhaps, hacked in twenty pieces with the sword, and that too before we have repented of all our sins. O Lord, have mercy upon us! to be sure the soldiers are a wicked kind of people. I never loved to have anything to do with them. I could hardly bring myself ever to look upon them as Christians. There is nothing but cursing and swearing among them. I wish your honour would repent: I heartily wish you would repent before it is too late; and not think of going among them.—Evil communication corrupts good manners. That is my principal reason. For as for that matter, I am no more afraid than another man, not I; as to matter of that. I know all human flesh must die; but yet a man may live many years, for all that. Why, I am a middle-aged man now, and yet I may live a great number of years. I have read of several who have lived to be above a hundred, and some a great deal above a hundred. Not that I hope, I mean that I promise myself, to live to any such age as that, neither.一But if it be only to eighty or ninety. Heaven be praised, that is a great ways off yet; and I am not afraid of dying then, no more than another man; but, surely, to tempt death before a man's time is come seems to me downright wickedness and presumption. Besides, if it was to do any good indeed; but, let the cause be what it will, what mighty matter of good can two people do? and, for my part, I understand nothing of it. I never fired off a gun above ten times in my life; and then it was not charged with bullets. And for the sword, I never learned to fence, and know nothing of the matter. And then there are those cannons, which certainly it must be thought the highest presumption to go in the way of;
563
and nobody but a madman一I ask pardon; upon my soul I meant no harm; I beg I may not throw your honour into another passion."
"Be under no apprehension, Partridge," cries Jones; "I am now so well convinced of thy cowardice, that thou couldst not provoke me on any account." "Your honour," answered he, "may call me coward, or anything else you please. If loving to sleep in a whole skin makes a man a coward, non immunes ab illis malis sumus. I never read in my grammar that a man can't be a good man without fighting. Vir bonus est quis? Qui consulta patrum, qui leges juraque servat. Not a word of fighting; and I am sure the scripture is so much against it, that a man shall never persuade me he is a good Christian while he sheds Christian blood."
564
The adventure of a beggar-man.
Just as Partridge had uttered that good and pious doctrine, with which the last chapter concluded, they arrived at another cross-way, when a lame fellow in rags asked them for alms; upon which Partridge gave him a severe rebuke, saying, "Every parish ought to keep their own poor." Jones then fell a-laughing, and asked Partridge, "if he was not ashamed, with so much charity in his mouth, to have no charity in his heart. Your religion," says he, "serves you only for an excuse for your faults, but is no incentive to your virtue. Can any man who is really a Christian abstain from relieving one of his brethren in such a miserable condition?" And at the same time, putting his hand in his pocket, he gave the poor object a shilling.
"Master," cries the fellow, after thanking him, "I have a curious thing here in my pocket, which I found about two miles off, if your worship will please to buy it. I should not venture to pull it out to every one; but, as you are so good a gentleman, and so kind to the poor, you won't suspect a man of being a thief only because he is poor." He then pulled out a little gilt pocket-book, and delivered it into the hands of Jones.
Jones presently opened it, and (guess, reader, what he felt) saw in the first page the words Sophia Western, written by her own fair hand. He no sooner read the name than he prest it close to his lips; nor could he avoid falling into some very frantic raptures, notwithstanding his company; but, perhaps, these very raptures made him forget he was not alone.
While Jones was kissing and mumbling the book, as if he had an excellent brown buttered crust in his mouth or as if he had really been a bookworm, or an author who had nothing to eat but his own works, a piece of paper fell from its leaves to the ground, which Partridge took up, and delivered to Jones, who presently perceived it to be a bank-bill. It was, indeed, the very bill which Western had given his daughter the night
565
before her departure; and a Jew would have jumped to purchase it at five shillings less than £100.
The eyes of Partridge sparkled at this news, which Jones now proclaimed aloud; and so did (though with somewhat a different aspect) those of the poor fellow who had found the book; and who (I hope from a principle of honesty) had never opened it: but we should not deal honestly by the reader if we omitted to inform him of a circumstance which may be here a little material, viz. that the fellow could not read.
Jones, who had felt nothing but pure joy and transport from the finding the book, was affected with a mixture of concern at this new discovery; for his imagination instantly suggested to him that the owner of the bill might possibly want it before he should be able to convey it to her. He then acquainted the finder that he knew the lady to whom the book belonged, and would endeavour to find her out as soon as possible, and return it her.
The pocket-book was a late present from Mrs Western to her niece; it had cost five-and-twenty shillings, having been bought of a celebrated toyman; but the real value of the silver which it contained in its clasp was about eighteen-pence; and that price the said toyman, as it was altogether as good as when it first issued from his shop, would now have given for it. A prudent person would, however, have taken proper advantage of the ignorance of this fellow, and would not have offered more than a shilling, or perhaps sixpence, for it; nay, some perhaps would have given nothing, and left the fellow to his action of trover, which some learned serjeants may doubt whether he could, under these circumstances, have maintained.
Jones, on the contrary, whose character was on the outside of generosity, and may perhaps not very unjustly have been suspected of extravagance, without any hesitation gave a guinea in exchange for the book. The poor man, who had not for a long time before been possessed of so much treasure, gave Mr Jones a thousand thanks, and discovered little less of transport in his muscles than Jones had before shown when he had first read the name of Sophia Western.
The fellow very readily agreed to attend our travellers to the place where he had found the pocket-book. Together, therefore, they proceeded directly thither; but not so fast as Mr Jones desired; for his guide unfortunately happened to be lame, and could not possibly travel faster than a mile an hour. As this place, therefore, was at above three miles'
566
distance, though the fellow had said otherwise, the reader need not be acquainted how long they were in walking it.
Jones opened the book a hundred times during their walk, kissed it as often, talked much to himself, and very little to his companions. At all which the guide exprest some signs of astonishment to Partridge; who more than once shook his head, and cryed, Poor gentleman! orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano.
At length they arrived at the very spot where Sophia unhappily dropt the pocket-book, and where the fellow had as happily found it. Here Jones offered to take leave of his guide, and to improve his pace; but the fellow, in whom that violent surprize and joy which the first receipt of the guinea had occasioned was now considerably abated, and who had now had sufficient time to recollect himself, put on a discontented look, and, scratching his head, said, "He hoped his worship would give him something more. Your worship," said he, "will, I hope, take it into your consideration that if I had not been honest I might have kept the whole." And, indeed, this the reader must confess to have been true. "If the paper there," said he, "be worth £100, I am sure the finding it deserves more than a guinea. Besides, suppose your worship should never see the lady, nor give it her一and, though your worship looks and talks very much like a gentleman, yet I have only your worship's bare word; and, certainly, if the right owner ben't to be found, it all belongs to the first finder. I hope your worship will consider of all these matters: I am but a poor man, and therefore don't desire to have all; but it is but reasonable I should have my share. Your worship looks like a good man, and, I hope, will consider my honesty; for I might have kept every farthing, and nobody ever the wiser." "I promise thee, upon my honour," cries Jones, "that I know the right owner, and will restore it her." "Nay, your worship," answered the fellow, "may do as you please as to that; if you will but give me my share, that is, one-half of the money, your honour may keep the rest yourself if you please;" and concluded with swearing, by a very vehement oath, "that he would never mention a syllable of it to any man living."
"Lookee, friend," cries Jones, "the right owner shall certainly have again all that she lost; and as for any farther gratuity, I really cannot give it you at present; but let me know your name, and where you live, and it is more than possible you may hereafter have further reason to rejoice at this morning's adventure."
567
"I don't know what you mean by venture," cries the fellow; "it seems I must venture whether you will return the lady her money or no; but I hope your worship will consider一" "Come, come," said Partridge, "tell his honour your name, and where you may be found; I warrant you will never repent having put the money into his hands." The fellow, seeing no hopes of recovering the possession of the pocket-book, at last complied in giving in his name and place of abode, which Jones writ upon a piece of paper with the pencil of Sophia; and then, placing the paper in the same page where she had writ her name, he cried out, "There, friend, you are the happiest man alive; I have joined your name to that of an angel." "I don't know anything about angels," answered the fellow; "but I wish you would give me a little more money, or else return me the pocket-book." Partridge now waxed wrath: he called the poor cripple by several vile and opprobrious names, and was absolutely proceeding to beat him, but Jones would not suffer any such thing: and now, telling the fellow he would certainly find some opportunity of serving him, Mr Jones departed as fast as his heels would carry him; and Partridge, into whom the thoughts of the hundred pound had infused new spirits, followed his leader; while the man, who was obliged to stay behind, fell to cursing them both, as well as his parents; "for had they," says he, "sent me to charity-school to learn to write and read and cast accounts, I should have known the value of these matters as well as other people."

Chapter U
Containing more adventures which Mr Jones and his companion met on the road.
Our travellers now walked so fast, that they had very little time or breath for conversation; Jones meditating all the way on Sophia, and Partridge on the bank-bill, which, though it gave him some pleasure, caused him at the same time to repine at fortune, which, in all his walks, had never given him such an opportunity of showing his honesty. They had proceeded above three miles, when Partridge, being unable any longer to keep up with Jones, called to him, and begged him a little to slacken his pace: with this he was the more ready to comply, as he had for some time lost the footsteps of the horses, which the thaw had enabled him to trace for several miles, and he was now upon a wide common, where were several roads.
He here therefore stopt to consider which of these roads he should pursue; when on a sudden they heard the noise of a drum, that seemed at no great distance. This sound presently alarmed the fears of Partridge, and he cried out, "Lord have mercy upon us all; they are certainly a coming!" "Who is coming?" cries Jones; for fear had long since given place to softer ideas in his mind; and since his adventure with the lame man, he had been totally intent on pursuing Sophia, without entertaining one thought of an enemy. "Who?" cries Partridge, "why, the rebels: but why should I call them rebels? they may be very honest gentlemen, for anything I know to the contrary. The devil take him that affronts them, I say; I am sure, if they have nothing to say to me, I will have nothing to say to them, but in a civil way. For Heaven's sake, sir, don't affront them if they should come, and perhaps they may do us no harm; but would it not be the wiser way to creep into some of yonder bushes, till they are gone by? What can two unarmed men do perhaps against fifty thousand? Certainly nobody but a madman; I hope your honour is not offended; but certainly no man who hath mens sana in corpore sano---" Here Jones in-
terrupted this torrent of eloquence, which fear had inspired, saying,
569
"That by the drum he perceived they were near some town." He then made directly towards the place whence the noise proceeded, bidding Partridge "take courage, for that he would lead him into no danger;" and adding, "it was impossible the rebels should be so near."
Partridge was a little comforted with this last assurance; and though he would more gladly have gone the contrary way, he followed his leader, his heart beating time, but not after the manner of heroes, to the music of the drum, which ceased not till they had traversed the common, and were come into a narrow lane.
And now Partridge, who kept even pace with Jones, discovered something painted flying in the air, a very few yards before him, which fancying to be the colours of the enemy, he fell a bellowing, "Oh Lord, sir, here they are; there is the crown and coffin. Oh Lord! I never saw anything so terrible; and we are within gun-shot of them already."
Jones no sooner looked up, than he plainly perceived what it was which Partridge had thus mistaken. "Partridge," says he, "I fancy you will be able to engage this whole army yourself; for by the colours I guess what the drum was which we heard before, and which beats up for recruits to a puppet-show."
"A puppet-show!" answered Partridge, with most eager transport. "And is it really no more than that? I love a puppet-show of all the pastimes upon earth. Do, good sir, let us tarry and see it. Besides, I am quite famished to death; for it is now almost dark, and I have not eat a morsel since three o'clock in the morning."
They now arrived at an inn, or indeed an ale-house, where Jones was prevailed upon to stop, the rather as he had no longer any assurance of being in the road he desired. They walked both directly into the kitchen, where Jones began to enquire if no ladies had passed that way in the morning, and Partridge as eagerly examined into the state of their provisions; and indeed his enquiry met with the better success; for Jones could not hear news of Sophia; but Partridge, to his great satisfaction, found good reason to expect very shortly the agreeable sight of an excellent smoaking dish of eggs and bacon.
In strong and healthy constitutions love hath a very different effect from what it causes in the puny part of the species. In the latter it generally destroys all that appetite which tends towards the conservation of the individual; but in the former, though it often induces forgetfulness, and a neglect of food, as well as of everything else; yet place a good piece of well-powdered buttock before a hungry lover, and he seldom fails
570
very handsomely to play his part. Thus it happened in the present case; for though Jones perhaps wanted a prompter, and might have travelled much farther, had he been alone, with an empty stomach; yet no sooner did he sit down to the bacon and eggs, than he fell to as heartily and voraciously as Partridge himself.
Before our travellers had finished their dinner, night came on, and as the moon was now past the full, it was extremely dark. Partridge therefore prevailed on Jones to stay and see the puppet-show, which was just going to begin, and to which they were very eagerly invited by the master of the said show, who declared that his figures were the finest which the world had ever produced, and that they had given great satisfaction to all the quality in every town in England.
The puppet-show was performed with great regularity and decency. It was called the fine and serious part of the Provoked Husband; and it was indeed a very grave and solemn entertainment, without any low wit or humour, or jests; or, to do it no more than justice, without anything which could provoke a laugh. The audience were all highly pleased. A grave matron told the master she would bring her two daughters the next night, as he did not show any stuff; and an attorney's clerk and an exciseman both declared, that the characters of Lord and Lady Townley were well preserved, and highly in nature. Partridge likewise concurred with this opinion.
The master was so highly elated with these encomiums, that he could not refrain from adding some more of his own. He said, "The present age was not improved in anything so much as in their puppet-shows; which, by throwing out Punch and his wife Joan, and such idle trumpery, were at last brought to be a rational entertainment. I remember," said he, "when I first took to the business, there was a great deal of low stuff that did very well to make folks laugh; but was never calculated to improve the morals of young people, which certainly ought to be principally aimed at in every puppet-show: for why may not good and instructive lessons be conveyed this way, as well as any other? My figures are as big as the life, and they represent the life in every particular; and I question not but people rise from my little drama as much improved as they do from the great." "I would by no means degrade the ingenuity of your profession," answered Jones, "but I should have been glad to have seen my old acquaintance master Punch, for all that; and so far from improving, I think, by leaving out him and his merry wife Joan, you have spoiled your puppet-show."
571
The dancer of wires conceived an immediate and high contempt for Jones, from these words. And with much disdain in his countenance, he replied, "Very probably, sir, that may be your opinion; but I have the satisfaction to know the best judges differ from you, and it is impossible to please every taste. I confess, indeed, some of the quality at Bath, two or three years ago, wanted mightily to bring Punch again upon the stage. I believe I lost some money for not agreeing to it; but let others do as they will; a little matter shall never bribe me to degrade my own profession, nor will I ever willingly consent to the spoiling the decency and regularity of my stage, by introducing any such low stuff upon it."
"Right, friend," cries the clerk, "you are very right. Always avoid what is low. There are several of my acquaintance in London, who are resolved to drive everything which is low from the stage." "Nothing can be more proper," cries the exciseman, pulling his pipe from his mouth. "I remember," added he, "(for I then lived with my lord) I was in the footman's gallery, the night when this play of the Provoked Husband was acted first. There was a great deal of low stuff in it about a country gentleman come up to town to stand for parliament-man; and there they brought a parcel of his servants upon the stage, his coachman I remember particularly; but the gentlemen in our gallery could not bear anything so low, and they damned it. I observe, friend, you have left all that matter out, and you are to be commended for it."
"Nay, gentlemen," cries Jones, "I can never maintain my opinion against so many; indeed, if the generality of his audience dislike him, the learned gentleman who conducts the show might have done very right in dismissing Punch from his service."
The master of the show then began a second harangue, and said much of the great force of example, and how much the inferior part of mankind would be deterred from vice, by observing how odious it was in their superiors; when he was unluckily interrupted by an incident, which, though perhaps we might have omitted it at another time, we cannot help relating at present, but not in this chapter.

From which it may be inferred that the best things are liable to be misunderstood and misinterpreted.
A violent uproar now arose in the entry, where my landlady was well cuffing her maid both with her fist and tongue. She had indeed missed the wench from her employment, and, after a little search, had found her on the puppet-show stage in company with the Merry Andrew, and in a situation not very proper to be described.
Though Grace (for that was her name) had forfeited all title to modesty; yet had she not impudence enough to deny a fact in which she was actually surprized; she, therefore, took another turn, and attempted to mitigate the offence. "Why do you beat me in this manner, mistress?" cries the wench. "If you don't like my doings, you may turn me away. If I am a w一e" (for the other had liberally bestowed that appellation on her), "my betters are so as well as I. What was the fine lady in the puppetshow just now? I suppose she did not lie all night out from her husband for nothing."
The landlady now burst into the kitchen, and fell foul on both her husband and the poor puppet-mover. "Here, husband," says she, "you see the consequence of harbouring these people in your house. If one doth draw a little drink the more for them, one is hardly made amends for the litter they make; and then to have one's house made a bawdy-house of by such lousy vermin. In short, I desire you would be gone to-morrow morning; for I will tolerate no more such doings. It is only the way to teach our servants idleness and nonsense; for to be sure nothing better can be learned by such idle shows as these. I remember when puppetshows were made of good scripture stories, as Jephthah's Rash Vow, and such good things, and when wicked people were carried away by the devil. There was some sense in those matters; but as the parson told us last Sunday, nobody believes in the devil now-a-days; and here you bring about a parcel of puppets drest up like lords and ladies, only to
573
turn the heads of poor country wenches; and when their heads are once turned topsy-turvy, no wonder everything else is so."
Virgil, I think, tells us, that when the mob are assembled in a riotous and tumultuous manner, and all sorts of missile weapons fly about, if a man of gravity and authority appears amongst them, the tumult is presently appeased, and the mob, which when collected into one body, may be well compared to an ass, erect their long ears at the grave man's discourse.
On the contrary, when a set of grave men and philosophers are disputing; when wisdom herself may in a manner be considered as present, and administering arguments to the disputants; should a tumult arise among the mob, or should one scold, who is herself equal in noise to a mighty mob, appear among the said philosophers; their disputes cease in a moment, wisdom no longer performs her ministerial office, and the attention of every one is immediately attracted by the scold alone.
Thus the uproar aforesaid, and the arrival of the landlady, silenced the master of the puppet-show, and put a speedy and final end to that grave and solemn harangue, of which we have given the reader a sufficient taste already. Nothing indeed could have happened so very inopportune as this accident; the most wanton malice of fortune could not have contrived such another stratagem to confound the poor fellow, while he was so triumphantly descanting on the good morals inculcated by his exhibitions. His mouth was now as effectually stopt, as that of quack must be, if, in the midst of a declamation on the great virtues of his pills and powders, the corpse of one of his martyrs should be brought forth, and deposited before the stage, as a testimony of his skill.
Instead, therefore, of answering my landlady, the puppet-show man ran out to punish his Merry Andrew; and now the moon beginning to put forth her silver light, as the poets call it (though she looked at that time more like a piece of copper), Jones called for his reckoning, and ordered Partridge, whom my landlady had just awaked from a profound nap, to prepare for his journey; but Partridge, having lately carried two points, as my reader hath seen before, was emboldened to attempt a third, which was to prevail with Jones to take up a lodging that evening in the house where he then was. He introduced this with an affected surprize at the intention which Mr Jones declared of removing; and, after urging many excellent arguments against it, he at last insisted strongly that it could be to no manner of purpose whatever; for that, unless Jones knew which way the lady was gone, every step he took might very
574
possibly lead him the farther from her; "for you find, sir," said he, "by all the people in the house, that she is not gone this way. How much better, therefore, would it be to stay till the morning, when we may expect to meet with somebody to enquire of?"
This last argument had indeed some effect on Jones, and while he was weighing it the landlord threw all the rhetoric of which he was master into the same scale. "Sure, sir," said he, "your servant gives you most excellent advice; for who would travel by night at this time of the year?" He then began in the usual stile to trumpet forth the excellent accommodation which his house afforded; and my landlady likewise opened on the occasion-----But, not to detain the reader with what is common to
every host and hostess, it is sufficient to tell him Jones was at last prevailed on to stay and refresh himself with a few hours' rest, which indeed he very much wanted; for he had hardly shut his eyes since he had left the inn where the accident of the broken head had happened.
As soon as Jones had taken a resolution to proceed no farther that night, he presently retired to rest, with his two bedfellows, the pocketbook and the muff; but Partridge, who at several times had refreshed himself with several naps, was more inclined to eating than to sleeping, and more to drinking than to either.
And now the storm which Grace had raised being at an end, and my landlady being again reconciled to the puppet-man, who on his side forgave the indecent reflections which the good woman in her passion had cast on his performances, a face of perfect peace and tranquillity reigned in the kitchen; where sat assembled round the fire the landlord and landlady of the house, the master of the puppet-show, the attorney's clerk, the exciseman, and the ingenious Mr Partridge; in which company past the agreeable conversation which will be found in the next chapter.
575

Chapter /
Containing a remark or two of our own and many more of the good company assembled in the kitchen.
Though the pride of Partridge did not submit to acknowledge himself a servant, yet he condescended in most particulars to imitate the manners of that rank. One instance of this was, his greatly magnifying the fortune of his companion, as he called Jones: such is a general custom with all servants among strangers, as none of them would willingly be thought the attendant on a beggar: for, the higher the situation of the master is, the higher consequently is that of the man in his own opinion; the truth of which observation appears from the behaviour of all the footmen of the nobility.
But, though title and fortune communicate a splendor all around them, and the footmen of men of quality and of estate think themselves entitled to a part of that respect which is paid to the quality and estate of their masters, it is clearly otherwise with regard to virtue and understanding. These advantages are strictly personal, and swallow themselves all the respect which is paid to them. To say the truth, this is so very little, that they cannot well afford to let any others partake with them. As these therefore reflect no honour on the domestic, so neither is he at all dishonoured by the most deplorable want of both in his master. Indeed it is otherwise in the want of what is called virtue in a mistress, the consequence of which we have before seen: for in this dishonour there is a kind of contagion, which, like that of poverty, communicates itself to all who approach it.
Now for these reasons we are not to wonder that servants (I mean among the men only) should have so great regard for the reputation of the wealth of their masters, and little or none at all for their character in other points, and that, though they would be ashamed to be the footman of a beggar, they are not so to attend upon a rogue or a blockhead; and do consequently make no scruple to spread the fame of the iniquities and follies of their said masters as far as possible, and this often with great
576
humour and merriment. In reality, a footman is often a wit as well as a beau, at the expence of the gentleman whose livery he wears.
After Partridge, therefore, had enlarged greatly on the vast fortune to which Mr Jones was heir, he very freely communicated an apprehension, which he had begun to conceive the day before, and for which, as we hinted at that very time, the behaviour of Jones seemed to have furnished a sufficient foundation. In short, he was now pretty well confirmed in an opinion that his master was out of his wits, with which opinion he very bluntly acquainted the good company round the fire.
With this sentiment the puppet-show man immediately coincided. "I own," said he, "the gentleman surprized me very much, when he talked so absurdly about puppet-shows. It is indeed hardly to be conceived that any man in his senses should be so much mistaken; what you say now accounts very well for all his monstrous notions. Poor gentleman! I am heartily concerned for him; indeed he hath a strange wildness about his eyes, which I took notice of before, though I did not mention it."
The landlord agreed with this last assertion, and likewise claimed the sagacity of having observed it. "And certainly," added he, "it must be so; for no one but a madman would have thought of leaving so good a house to ramble about the country at that time of night."
The exciseman, pulling his pipe from his mouth, said, "He thought the gentleman looked and talked a little wildly;" and then turning to Partridge, "if he be a madman," says he, "he should not be suffered to travel thus about the country; for possibly he may do some mischief. It is a pity he was not secured and sent home to his relations."
Now some conceits of this kind were likewise lurking in the mind of Partridge; for, as he was now persuaded that Jones had run away from Mr Allworthy, he promised himself the highest rewards if he could by any means convey him back. But fear of Jones, of whose fierceness and strength he had seen, and indeed felt, some instances, had however represented any such scheme as impossible to be executed, and had discouraged him from applying himself to form any regular plan for the purpose. But no sooner did he hear the sentiments of the exciseman than he embraced that opportunity of declaring his own, and expressed a hearty wish that such a matter could be brought about.
"Could be brought about!" says the exciseman: "why, there is nothing easier."
577
"Ah! sir," answered Partridge, "you don't know what a devil of a fellow he is. He can take me up with one hand, and throw me out at window; and he would, too, if he did but imagine一"
"Pogh!" says the exciseman, "I believe I am as good a man as he. Besides, here are five of us."
"I don't know what five," cries the landlady, "my husband shall have nothing to do in it. Nor shall any violent hands be laid upon anybody in my house. The young gentleman is as pretty a young gentleman as ever I saw in my life, and I believe he is no more mad than any of us. What do you tell of his having a wild look with his eyes? they are the prettiest eyes I ever saw, and he hath the prettiest look with them; and a very modest civil young man he is. I am sure I have bepitied him heartily ever since the gentleman there in the corner told us he was crost in love. Certainly that is enough to make any man, especially such a sweet young gentleman as he is, to look a little otherwise than he did before. Lady, indeed! what the devil would the lady have better than such a handsome man with a great estate? I suppose she is one of your quality folks, one of your Townly ladies that we saw last night in the puppet-show, who don't know what they would be at."
The attorney's clerk likewise declared he would have no concern in the business without the advice of counsel. "Suppose," says he, "an action of false imprisonment should be brought against us, what defence could we make? Who knows what may be sufficient evidence of madness to a jury? But I only speak upon my own account; for it don't look well for a lawyer to be concerned in these matters, unless it be as a lawyer. Juries are always less favourable to us than to other people. I don't therefore dissuade you, Mr Thomson (to the exciseman), nor the gentleman, nor anybody else."
The exciseman shook his head at this speech, and the puppet-show man said, "Madness was sometimes a difficult matter for a jury to decide: for I remember," says he, "I was once present at a tryal of madness, where twenty witnesses swore that the person was as mad as a March hare; and twenty others, that he was as much in his senses as any man in England.一And indeed it was the opinion of most people, that it was only a trick of his relations to rob the poor man of his right."
"Very likely!" cries the landlady. "I myself knew a poor gentleman who was kept in a mad-house all his life by his family, and they enjoyed his estate, but it did them no good; for though the law gave it them, it was the right of another."
578
"Pogh!" cries the clerk, with great contempt, "who hath any right but what the law gives them? If the law gave me the best estate in the country, I should never trouble myself much who had the right."
"If it be so," says Partridge, "Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum."
My landlord, who had been called out by the arrival of a horseman at the gate, now returned into the kitchen, and with an affrighted countenance cried out, "What do you think, gentlemen? The rebels have given the duke the slip, and are got almost to London. It is certainly true, for a man on horseback just now told me so."
"I am glad of it with all my heart," cries Partridge; "then there will be no fighting in these parts."
"I am glad," cries the clerk, "for a better reason; for I would always have right take place."
"Ay, but," answered the landlord, "I have heard some people say this man hath no right."
"I will prove the contrary in a moment," cries the clerk: "if my father dies seized of a right; do you mind me, seized of a right, I say; doth not that right descend to his son; and doth not one right descend as well as another?"
"But how can he have any right to make us papishes?" says the landlord.
"Never fear that," cries Partridge. "As to the matter of right, the gentleman there hath proved it as clear as the sun; and as to the matter of religion, it is quite out of the case. The papists themselves don't expect any such thing. A popish priest, whom I know very well, and who is a very honest man, told me upon his word and honour they had no such design."
"And another priest, of my acquaintance," said the landlady, "hath told me the same thing; but my husband is always so afraid of papishes. I know a great many papishes that are very honest sort of people, and spend their money very freely; and it is always a maxim with me, that one man's money is as good as another's."
"Very true, mistress," said the puppet-show man, "I don't care what religion comes; provided the Presbyterians are not uppermost; for they are enemies to puppet-shows."
"And so you would sacrifice your religion to your interest," cries the exciseman; "and are desirous to see popery brought in, are you?"
579
"Not I, truly," answered the other; "I hate popery as much as any man; but yet it is a comfort to one, that one should be able to live under it, which I could not do among Presbyterians. To be sure, every man values his livelihood first; that must be granted; and I warrant, if you would confess the truth, you are more afraid of losing your place than anything else; but never fear, friend, there will be an excise under another government as well as under this."
"Why, certainly," replied the exciseman, "I should be a very ill man if I did not honour the king, whose bread I eat. That is no more than natural, as a man may say: for what signifies it to me that there would be an excise-office under another government, since my friends would be out, and I could expect no better than to follow them? No, no, friend, I shall never be bubbled out of my religion in hopes only of keeping my place under another government; for I should certainly be no better, and very probably might be worse."
"Why, that is what I say," cries the landlord, "whenever folks say who knows what may happen! Odsooks! should not I be a blockhead to lend my money to I know not who, because mayhap he may return it again? I am sure it is safe in my own bureau, and there I will keep it."
The attorney's clerk had taken a great fancy to the sagacity of Partridge. Whether this proceeded from the great discernment which the former had into men, as well as things, or whether it arose from the sympathy between their minds; for they were both truly Jacobites in principle; they now shook hands heartily, and drank bumpers of strong beer to healths which we think proper to bury in oblivion.
These healths were afterwards pledged by all present, and even by my landlord himself, though reluctantly; but he could not withstand the menaces of the clerk, who swore he would never set his foot within his house again, if he refused. The bumpers which were swallowed on this occasion soon put an end to the conversation. Here, therefore, we will put an end to the chapter.

Chapter V?
In which fortune seems to have been in a better humour with Jones than we have hitherto seen her.
As there is no wholesomer, so perhaps there are few stronger, sleeping potions than fatigue. Of this Jones might be said to have taken a very large dose, and it operated very forcibly upon him. He had already slept nine hours, and might perhaps have slept longer, had he not been awakened by a most violent noise at his chamber-door, where the sound of many heavy blows was accompanied with many exclamations of murder. Jones presently leapt from his bed, where he found the master of the puppet-show belabouring the back and ribs of his poor Merry-Andrew, without either mercy or moderation.
Jones instantly interposed on behalf of the suffering party, and pinned the insulting conqueror up to the wall: for the puppet-show man was no more able to contend with Jones than the poor party-coloured jester had been to contend with this puppet-man.
But though the Merry-Andrew was a little fellow, and not very strong, he had nevertheless some choler about him. He therefore no sooner found himself delivered from the enemy, than he began to attack him with the only weapon at which he was his equal. From this he first discharged a volley of general abusive words, and thence proceeded to some particular accusations一"D一n your bl一d, you rascal," says he, "I have not only supported you (for to me you owe all the money you get), but I have saved you from the gallows. Did you not want to rob the lady of her fine riding-habit, no longer ago than yesterday, in the back-lane here? Can you deny that you wished to have her alone in a wood to strip her一to strip one of the prettiest ladies that ever was seen in the world? and here you have fallen upon me, and have almost murdered me, for doing no harm to a girl as willing as myself, only because she likes me better than you."
581
Jones no sooner heard this than he quitted the master, laying on him at the same time the most violent injunctions of forbearance from any further insult on the Merry-Andrew; and then taking the poor wretch with him into his own apartment, he soon learned tidings of his Sophia, whom the fellow, as he was attending his master with his drum the day before, had seen pass by. He easily prevailed with the lad to show him the exact place,
oned Partridge, he departed with the utmost expedition.
It was almost eight of the clock before all matters could be got ready for his departure: for Partridge was not in any haste, nor could the reckoning be presently adjusted; and when both these were settled and over, Jones would not quit the place before he had perfectly reconciled all differences between the master and the man.
When this was happily accomplished, he set forwards, and was by the trusty Merry-Andrew conducted to the spot by which Sophia had past; and then having handsomely rewarded his conductor, he again pushed on with the utmost eagerness, being highly delighted with the extraordinary manner in which he received his intelligence. Of this Partridge was no sooner acquainted, than he, with great earnestness, began to prophesy, and assured Jones that he would certainly have good success in the end: for, he said, "two such accidents could never have happened to direct him after his mistress, if Providence had not designed to bring them together at last." And this was the first time that Jones lent any attention to the superstitious doctrines of his companion.
They had not gone above two miles when a violent storm of rain overtook them; and, as they happened to be at the same time in sight of an ale-house, Partridge, with much earnest entreaty, prevailed with Jones to enter, and weather the storm. Hunger is an enemy (if indeed it may be called one) which partakes more of the English than of the French disposition; for, though you subdue this never so often, it will always rally again in time; and so it did with Partridge, who was no sooner arrived within the kitchen, than he began to ask the same questions which he had asked the night before. The consequence of this was an excellent cold chine being produced upon the table, upon which not only Partridge, but Jones himself, made a very hearty breakfast, though the latter began to grow again uneasy, as the people of the house could give him no fresh information concerning Sophia.
Their meal being over, Jones was again preparing to sally, notwithstanding the violence of the storm still continued; but Partridge begged
582
heartily for another mug; and at last casting his eyes on a lad at the fire, who had entered into the kitchen, and who at that instant was looking as earnestly at him, he turned suddenly to Jones, and cried, "Master, give me your hand, a single mug shan't serve the turn this bout. Why, here's more news of Madam Sophia come to town. The boy there standing by the fire is the very lad that rode before her. I can swear to my own plaister on his face."一"Heavens bless you, sir," cries the boy, "it is your own plaister sure enough; I shall have always reason to remember your goodness; for it hath almost cured me."
At these words Jones started from his chair, and, bidding the boy follow him immediately, departed from the kitchen into a private apartment; for, so delicate was he with regard to Sophia, that he never willingly mentioned her name in the presence of many people; and, though he had, as it were, from the overflowings of his heart, given Sophia as a toast among the officers, where he thought it was impossible she should be known; yet, even there, the reader may remember how difficultly he was prevailed upon to mention her surname.
Hard therefore was it, and perhaps, in the opinion of many sagacious readers, very absurd and monstrous, that he should principally owe his present misfortune to the supposed want of that delicacy with which he so abounded; for, in reality, Sophia was much more offended at the freedoms which she thought (and not without good reason) he had taken with her name and character, than at any freedoms, in which, under his present circumstances, he had indulged himself with the person of another woman; and to say truth, I believe Honour could never have prevailed on her to leave Upton without her seeing Jones, had it not been for those two strong instances of a levity in his behaviour, so void of respect, and indeed so highly inconsistent with any degree of love and tenderness in great and delicate minds.
But so matters fell out, and so I must relate them; and if any reader is shocked at their appearing unnatural, I cannot help it. I must remind such persons that I am not writing a system, but a history, and I am not obliged to reconcile every matter to the received notions concerning truth and nature. But if this was never so easy to do, perhaps it might be more prudent in me to avoid it. For instance, as the fact at present before us now stands, without any comment of mine upon it, though it may at first sight offend some readers, yet, upon more mature consideration, it must please all; for wise and good men may consider what happened to Jones at Upton as a just punishment for his wickedness with regard to women, of which it was indeed the immediate consequence; and silly
583
and bad persons may comfort themselves in their vices by flattering their own hearts that the characters of men are rather owing to accident than to virtue. Now, perhaps the reflections which we should be here inclined to draw would alike contradict both these conclusions, and would show that these incidents contribute only to confirm the great, useful, and uncommon doctrine, which it is the purpose of this whole work to inculcate, and which we must not fill up our pages by frequently repeating, as an ordinary parson fills his sermon by repeating his text at the end of every paragraph.
We are contented that it must appear, however unhappily Sophia had erred in her opinion of Jones, she had sufficient reason for her opinion; since, I believe, every other young lady would, in her situation, have erred in the same manner. Nay, had she followed her lover at this very time, and had entered this very alehouse the moment he was departed from it, she would have found the landlord as well acquainted with her name and person as the wench at Upton had appeared to be. For while Jones was examining his boy in whispers in an inner room, Partridge, who had no such delicacy in his disposition, was in the kitchen very openly catechising the other guide who had attended Mrs Fitzpatrick; by which means the landlord, whose ears were open on all such occasions, became perfectly well acquainted with the tumble of Sophia from her horse, &amp;c., with the mistake concerning Jenny Cameron, with the many consequences of the punch, and, in short, with almost everything which had happened at the inn whence we despatched our ladies in a coach-and-six when we last took our leaves of them.
584

Chapter J
Containing little more than a few odd observations.
Jones had been absent a full half-hour, when he returned into the kitchen in a hurry, desiring the landlord to let him know that instant what was to pay. And now the concern which Partridge felt at being obliged to quit the warm chimney-corner, and a cup of excellent liquor, was somewhat compensated by hearing that he was to proceed no farther on foot, for Jones, by golden arguments, had prevailed with the boy to attend him back to the inn whither he had before conducted Sophia; but to this however the lad consented, upon condition that the other guide would wait for him at the alehouse; because, as the landlord at Upton was an intimate acquaintance of the landlord at Gloucester, it might some time or other come to the ears of the latter that his horses had been let to more than one person; and so the boy might be brought to account for money which he wisely intended to put in his own pocket.
We were obliged to mention this circumstance, trifling as it may seem, since it retarded Mr Jones a considerable time in his setting out; for the honesty of this latter boy was somewhat high一that is, somewhat high-priced, and would indeed have cost Jones very dear, had not Partridge, who, as we have said, was a very cunning fellow, artfully thrown in half-a-crown to be spent at that very alehouse, while the boy was waiting for his companion. This half-crown the landlord no sooner got scent of, than he opened after it with such vehement and persuasive outcry, that the boy was soon overcome, and consented to take half-a-crown more for his stay. Here we cannot help observing, that as there is so much of policy in the lowest life, great men often overvalue themselves on those refinements in imposture, in which they are frequently excelled by some of the lowest of the human species.
The horses being now produced, Jones directly leapt into the sidesaddle, on which his dear Sophia had rid. The lad, indeed, very civilly offered him the use of his; but he chose the side-saddle, probably because it was softer. Partridge, however, though full as effeminate as
585
Jones, could not bear the thoughts of degrading his manhood; he therefore accepted the boy's offer: and now, Jones being mounted on the sidesaddle of his Sophia, the boy on that of Mrs Honour, and Partridge bestriding the third horse, they set forwards on their journey, and within four hours arrived at the inn where the reader hath already spent so much time. Partridge was in very high spirits during the whole way, and often mentioned to Jones the many good omens of his future success which had lately befriended him; and which the reader, without being the least superstitious, must allow to have been particularly fortunate. Partridge was moreover better pleased with the present pursuit of his companion than he had been with his pursuit of glory; and from these very omens, which assured the pedagogue of success, he likewise first acquired a clear idea of the amour between Jones and Sophia; to which he had before given very little attention, as he had originally taken a wrong scent concerning the reasons of Jones's departure; and as to what happened at Upton, he was too much frightened just before and after his leaving that place to draw any other conclusions from thence than that poor Jones was a downright madman: a conceit which was not at all disagreeable to the opinion he before had of his extraordinary wildness, of which, he thought, his behaviour on their quitting Gloucester so well justified all the accounts he had formerly received. He was now, however, pretty well satisfied with his present expedition, and henceforth began to conceive much worthier sentiments of his friend's understanding.
The clock had just struck three when they arrived, and Jones immediately bespoke post-horses; but unluckily there was not a horse to be procured in the whole place; which the reader will not wonder at when he considers the hurry in which the whole nation, and especially this part of it, was at this time engaged, when expresses were passing and repassing every hour of the day and night.
Jones endeavoured all he could to prevail with his former guide to es-corte him to Coventry; but he was inexorable. While he was arguing with the boy in the inn-yard, a person came up to him, and saluting him by his name, enquired how all the good family did in Somersetshire; and now Jones casting his eyes upon this person, presently discovered him to be Mr Dowling, the lawyer, with whom he had dined at Gloucester, and with much courtesy returned the salutation.
Dowling very earnestly pressed Mr Jones to go no further that night; and backed his solicitations with many unanswerable arguments, such as, that it was almost dark, that the roads were very dirty, and that he would be able to travel much better by day-light, with many others
586
equally good, some of which Jones had probably suggested to himself before; but as they were then ineffectual, so they were still: and he continued resolute in his design, even though he should be obliged to set out on foot.
When the good attorney found he could not prevail on Jones to stay, he as strenuously applied himself to persuade the guide to accompany him. He urged many motives to induce him to undertake this short journey, and at last concluded with saying, "Do you think the gentleman won't very well reward you for your trouble?"
Two to one are odds at every other thing as well as at foot-ball. But the advantage which this united force hath in persuasion or entreaty must have been visible to a curious observer; for he must have often seen, that when a father, a master, a wife, or any other person in authority, have stoutly adhered to a denial against all the reasons which a single man could produce, they have afterwards yielded to the repetition of the same sentiments by a second or third person, who hath undertaken the cause, without attempting to advance anything new in its behalf. And hence, perhaps, proceeds the phrase of seconding an argument or a motion, and the great consequence this is of in all assemblies of public debate. Hence, likewise, probably it is, that in our courts of law we often hear a learned gentleman (generally a serjeant) repeating for an hour together what another learned gentleman, who spoke just before him, had been saying.
Instead of accounting for this, we shall proceed in our usual manner to exemplify it in the conduct of the lad above mentioned, who submitted to the persuasions of Mr Dowling, and promised once more to admit Jones into his side-saddle; but insisted on first giving the poor creatures a good bait, saying, they had travelled a great way, and been rid very hard. Indeed this caution of the boy was needless; for Jones, notwithstanding his hurry and impatience, would have ordered this of himself; for he by no means agreed with the opinion of those who consider animals as mere machines, and when they bury their spurs in the belly of their horse, imagine the spur and the horse to have an equal capacity of feeling pain.
While the beasts were eating their corn, or rather were supposed to eat it (for, as the boy was taking care of himself in the kitchen, the ostler took great care that his corn should not be consumed in the stable), Mr Jones, at the earnest desire of Mr Dowling, accompanied that gentleman into his room, where they sat down together over a bottle of wine.
587

Chapter A Vx
In which Mr Jones and Mr Dowling drink a bottle together.
Mr Dowling, pouring out a glass of wine, named the health of the good Squire Allworthy; adding, "If you please, sir, we will likewise remember his nephew and heir, the young squire: Come, sir, here's Mr Bli-fil to you, a very pretty young gentleman; and who, I dare swear, will hereafter make a very considerable figure in his country. I have a borough for him myself in my eye."
"Sir," answered Jones, "I am convinced you don't intend to affront me, so I shall not resent it; but I promise you, you have joined two persons very improperly together; for one is the glory of the human species, and the other is a rascal who dishonours the name of man."
Dowling stared at this. He said, "He thought both the gentlemen had a very unexceptionable character. As for Squire Allworthy himself," says he, "I never had the happiness to see him; but all the world talks of his goodness. And, indeed, as to the young gentleman, I never saw him but once, when I carried him the news of the loss of his mother; and then I was so hurried, and drove, and tore with the multiplicity of business, that I had hardly time to converse with him; but he looked so like a very honest gentleman, and behaved himself so prettily, that I protest I never was more delighted with any gentleman since I was born."
"I don't wonder," answered Jones, "that he should impose upon you in so short an acquaintance; for he hath the cunning of the devil himself, and you may live with him many years, without discovering him. I was bred up with him from my infancy, and we were hardly ever asunder; but it is very lately only that I have discovered half the villany which is in him. I own I never greatly liked him. I thought he wanted that generosity of spirit, which is the sure foundation of all that is great and noble in human nature. I saw a selfishness in him long ago which I despised; but it is lately, very lately, that I have found him capable of the basest and blackest designs; for, indeed, I have at last found out, that he hath
588
taken an advantage of the openness of my own temper, and hath concerted the deepest project, by a long train of wicked artifice, to work my ruin, which at last he hath effected."
"Ay! ay!" cries Dowling; "I protest, then, it is a pity such a person should inherit the great estate of your uncle Allworthy."
"Alas, sir," cries Jones, "you do me an honour to which I have no title. It is true, indeed, his goodness once allowed me the liberty of calling him by a much nearer name; but as this was only a voluntary act of goodness, I can complain of no injustice when he thinks proper to deprive me of this honour; since the loss cannot be more unmerited than the gift originally was. I assure you, sir, I am no relation of Mr Allworthy; and if the world, who are incapable of setting a true value on his virtue, should think, in his behaviour to me, he hath dealt hardly by a relation, they do an injustice to the best of men: for I—but I ask your pardon, I shall trouble you with no particulars relating to myself; only as you seemed to think me a relation of Mr Allworthy, I thought proper to set you right in a matter that might draw some censures upon him, which I promise you I would rather lose my life than give occasion to."
"I protest, sir," cried Dowling, "you talk very much like a man of honour; but instead of giving me any trouble, I protest it would give me great pleasure to know how you came to be thought a relation of Mr Allworthy's, if you are not. Your horses won't be ready this half-hour, and as you have sufficient opportunity, I wish you would tell me how all that happened; for I protest it seems very surprizing that you should pass for a relation of a gentleman, without being so."
Jones, who in the compliance of his disposition (though not in his prudence) a little resembled his lovely Sophia, was easily prevailed on to satisfy Mr Dowling's curiosity, by relating the history of his birth and education, which he did, like Othello.
---------Even from his boyish years, To th' very moment he was bad to tell:
the which to hear, Dowling, like Desdemona, did seriously incline;
He swore 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange; 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wonderous pitiful.
Mr Dowling was indeed very greatly affected with this relation; for he had not divested himself of humanity by being an attorney. Indeed, nothing is more unjust than to carry our prejudices against a profession into private life, and to borrow our idea of a man from our opinion of his
589
calling. Habit, it is true, lessens the horror of those actions which the profession makes necessary, and consequently habitual; but in all other instances, Nature works in men of all professions alike; nay, perhaps, even more strongly with those who give her, as it were, a holiday, when they are following their ordinary business. A butcher, I make no doubt, would feel compunction at the slaughter of a fine horse; and though a surgeon can feel no pain in cutting off a limb, I have known him compassionate a man in a fit of the gout. The common hangman, who hath stretched the necks of hundreds, is known to have trembled at his first operation on a head: and the very professors of human blood-shedding, who, in their trade of war, butcher thousands, not only of their fellowprofessors, but often of women and children, without remorse; even these, I say, in times of peace, when drums and trumpets are laid aside, often lay aside all their ferocity, and become very gentle members of civil society. In the same manner an attorney may feel all the miseries and distresses of his fellow-creatures, provided he happens not to be concerned against them.
Jones, as the reader knows, was yet unacquainted with the very black colours in which he had been represented to Mr Allworthy; and as to other matters, he did not shew them in the most disadvantageous light; for though he was unwilling to cast any blame on his former friend and patron; yet he was not very desirous of heaping too much upon himself. Dowling therefore observed, and not without reason, that very ill offices must have been done him by somebody: "For certainly," cries he, "the squire would never have disinherited you only for a few faults, which any young gentleman might have committed. Indeed, I cannot properly say disinherited: for to be sure by law you cannot claim as heir. That's certain; that nobody need go to counsel for. Yet when a gentleman had in a manner adopted you thus as his own son, you might reasonably have expected some very considerable part, if not the whole; nay, if you had expected the whole, I should not have blamed you: for certainly all men are for getting as much as they can, and they are not to be blamed on that account."
"Indeed you wrong me," said Jones; "I should have been contented with very little: I never had any view upon Mr Allworthy's fortune; nay, I believe I may truly say, I never once considered what he could or might give me. This I solemnly declare, if he had done a prejudice to his nephew in my favour, I would have undone it again. I had rather enjoy my own mind than the fortune of another man. What is the poor pride arising from a magnificent house, a numerous equipage, a splendid
590
table, and from all the other advantages or appearances of fortune, compared to the warm, solid content, the swelling satisfaction, the thrilling transports, and the exulting triumphs, which a good mind enjoys, in the contemplation of a generous, virtuous, noble, benevolent action? I envy not Blifil in the prospect of his wealth; nor shall I envy him in the possession of it. I would not think myself a rascal half an hour, to exchange situations. I believe, indeed, Mr Blifil suspected me of the views you mention; and I suppose these suspicions, as they arose from the baseness of his own heart, so they occasioned his baseness to me. But, I thank Heaven, I know, I feel一I feel my innocence, my friend; and I would not part with that feeling for the world. For as long as I know I have never done, nor even designed, an injury to any being whatever,
Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis Arbor aestiva recreatur aura, Quod latus mundi nebulae, malusque Jupiter urget.
Pone sub curru nimium propinqui Solis in terra dominibus negata; Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo, Dulce loquentem. 24
Place me beneath the burning ray, Where rolls the rapid car of day; Love and the nymph shall charm my toils, The nymph who sweetly speaks, and sweetly smiles. MR FRANCIS.
He then filled a bumper of wine, and drunk it off to the health of his dear Lalage; and, filling Dowling's glass likewise up to the brim, insisted on his pledging him. "Why, then, here's Miss Lalage's health with all my heart," cries Dowling. "I have heard her toasted often, I protest, though I never saw her; but they say she's extremely handsome."
Though the Latin was not the only part of this speech which Dowling did not perfectly understand; yet there was somewhat in it that made a very strong impression upon him. And though he endeavoured by winking, nodding, sneering, and grinning, to hide the impression from Jones (for we are as often ashamed of thinking right as of thinking wrong), it is certain he secretly approved as much of his sentiments as he understood, and really felt a very strong impulse of compassion for him. But we may possibly take some other opportunity of commenting upon this, especially if we should happen to meet Mr Dowling any more in the course of our history. At present we are obliged to take our leave of that gentleman a little abruptly, in imitation of Mr Jones; who was no sooner informed, by Partridge, that his horses were ready, than he deposited his
24.Place me where never summer breeze Unbinds the glebe, or warms the trees: Where ever-lowering clouds appear, And angry Jove deforms th' inclement year.
591
reckoning, wished his companion a good night, mounted, and set forward towards Coventry, though the night was dark, and it just then began to rain very hard.
592
The disasters which befel Jones on his departure for Coventry; with the sage remarks of Partridge.
No road can be plainer than that from the place where they now were to Coventry; and though neither Jones, nor Partridge, nor the guide, had ever travelled it before, it would have been almost impossible to have missed their way, had it not been for the two reasons mentioned in the conclusion of the last chapter.
These two circumstances, however, happening both unfortunately to intervene, our travellers deviated into a much less frequented track; and after riding full six miles, instead of arriving at the stately spires of Coventry, they found themselves still in a very dirty lane, where they saw no symptoms of approaching the suburbs of a large city.
Jones now declared that they must certainly have lost their way; but this the guide insisted upon was impossible; a word which, in common conversation, is often used to signify not only improbable, but often what is really very likely, and, sometimes, what hath certainly happened; an hyperbolical violence like that which is so frequently offered to the words infinite and eternal; by the former of which it is usual to express a distance of half a yard, and by the latter, a duration of five minutes. And thus it is as usual to assert the impossibility of losing what is already actually lost. This was, in fact, the case at present; for, notwithstanding all the confident assertions of the lad to the contrary, it is certain they were no more in the right road to Coventry, than the fraudulent, griping, cruel, canting miser is in the right road to heaven.
It is not, perhaps, easy for a reader, who hath never been in those circumstances, to imagine the horror with which darkness, rain, and wind, fill persons who have lost their way in the night; and who, consequently, have not the pleasant prospect of warm fires, dry cloaths, and other refreshments, to support their minds in struggling with the inclemencies of the weather. A very imperfect idea of this horror will, however, serve
593
sufficiently to account for the conceits which now filled the head of Partridge, and which we shall presently be obliged to open.
Jones grew more and more positive that they were out of their road; and the boy himself at last acknowledged he believed they were not in the right road to Coventry; though he affirmed, at the same time, it was impossible they should have mist the way. But Partridge was of a different opinion. He said, "When they first set out he imagined some mischief or other would happen.一Did not you observe, sir," said he to Jones, "that old woman who stood at the door just as you was taking horse? I wish you had given her a small matter, with all my heart; for she said then you might repent it; and at that very instant it began to rain, and the wind hath continued rising ever since. Whatever some people may think, I am very certain it is in the power of witches to raise the wind whenever they please. I have seen it happen very often in my time: and if ever I saw a witch in all my life, that old woman was certainly one. I thought so to myself at that very time; and if I had had any halfpence in my pocket, I would have given her some; for to be sure it is always good to be charitable to those sort of people, for fear what may happen; and many a person hath lost his cattle by saving a halfpenny."
Jones, though he was horridly vexed at the delay which this mistake was likely to occasion in his journey, could not help smiling at the superstition of his friend, whom an accident now greatly confirmed in his opinion. This was a tumble from his horse; by which, however, he received no other injury than what the dirt conferred on his cloaths.
Partridge had no sooner recovered his legs, than he appealed to his fall, as conclusive evidence of all he had asserted; but Jones finding he was unhurt, answered with a smile: "This witch of yours, Partridge, is a most ungrateful jade, and doth not, I find, distinguish her friends from others in her resentment. If the old lady had been angry with me for neglecting her, I don't see why she should tumble you from your horse, after all the respect you have expressed for her."
"It is ill jesting," cries Partridge, "with people who have power to do these things; for they are often very malicious. I remember a farrier, who provoked one of them, by asking her when the time she had bargained with the devil for would be out; and within three months from that very day one of his best cows was drowned. Nor was she satisfied with that; for a little time afterwards he lost a barrel of best-drink: for the old witch pulled out the spigot, and let it run all over the cellar, the very first evening he had tapped it to make merry with some of his neighbours. In
594
short, nothing ever thrived with him afterwards; for she worried the poor man so, that he took to drinking; and in a year or two his stock was seized, and he and his family are now come to the parish."
The guide, and perhaps his horse too, were both so attentive to this discourse, that, either through want of care, or by the malice of the witch, they were now both sprawling in the dirt.
Partridge entirely imputed this fall, as he had done his own, to the same cause. He told Mr Jones, "It would certainly be his turn next; and earnestly entreated him to return back, and find out the old woman, and pacify her. We shall very soon," added he, "reach the inn; for though we have seemed to go forward, I am very certain we are in the identical place in which we were an hour ago; and I dare swear, if it was daylight, we might now see the inn we set out from."
Instead of returning any answer to this sage advice, Jones was entirely attentive to what had happened to the boy, who received no other hurt than what had before befallen Partridge, and which his cloaths very easily bore, as they had been for many years inured to the like. He soon regained his side-saddle, and by the hearty curses and blows which he bestowed on his horse, quickly satisfied Mr Jones that no harm was done.
595

Chapter 且
Relates that Mr Jones continued his journey, contrary to the advice of Partridge, with what happened on that occasion.
They now discovered a light at some distance, to the great pleasure of Jones, and to the no small terror of Partridge, who firmly believed himself to be bewitched, and that this light was a Jack-with-a-lantern, or somewhat more mischievous.
But how were these fears increased, when, as they approached nearer to this light (or lights as they now appeared), they heard a confused sound of human voices; of singing, laughing, and hallowing, together with a strange noise that seemed to proceed from some instruments; but could hardly be allowed the name of music! indeed, to favour a little the opinion of Partridge, it might very well be called music bewitched.
It is impossible to conceive a much greater degree of horror than what now seized on Partridge; the contagion of which had reached the postboy, who had been very attentive to many things that the other had uttered. He now, therefore, joined in petitioning Jones to return; saying he firmly believed what Partridge had just before said, that though the horses seemed to go on, they had not moved a step forwards during at least the last half-hour.
Jones could not help smiling in the midst of his vexation, at the fears of these poor fellows. "Either we advance," says he, "towards the lights, or the lights have advanced towards us; for we are now at a very little distance from them; but how can either of you be afraid of a set of people who appear only to be merry-making?"
"Merry-making, sir!" cries Partridge; "who could be merry-making at this time of night, and in such a place, and such weather? They can be nothing but ghosts or witches, or some evil spirits or other, that's certain."
596
"Let them be what they will," cries Jones, "I am resolved to go up to them, and enquire the way to Coventry. All witches, Partridge, are not such ill-natured hags as that we had the misfortune to meet with last."
"O Lord, sir," cries Partridge, "there is no knowing what humour they will be in; to be sure it is always best to be civil to them; but what if we should meet with something worse than witches, with evil spirits themselves?----Pray, sir, be advised; pray, sir, do. If you had read so many
terrible accounts as I have of these matters, you would not be so foolhardy.-----The Lord knows whither we have got already, or whither we
are going; for sure such darkness was never seen upon earth, and I question whether it can be darker in the other world."
Jones put forwards as fast as he could, notwithstanding all these hints and cautions, and poor Partridge was obliged to follow; for though he hardly dared to advance, he dared still less to stay behind by himself.
At length they arrived at the place whence the lights and different noises had issued. This Jones perceived to be no other than a barn, where a great number of men and women were assembled, and diverting themselves with much apparent jollity.
Jones no sooner appeared before the great doors of the barn, which were open, than a masculine and very rough voice from within demanded, who was there?一To which Jones gently answered, a friend; and immediately asked the road to Coventry.
"If you are a friend," cries another of the men in the barn, "you had better alight till the storm is over" (for indeed it was now more violent than ever;) "you are very welcome to put up your horse; for there is sufficient room for him at the end of the barn."
"You are very obliging," returned Jones; "and I will accept your offer for a few minutes, whilst the rain continues; and here are two more who will be glad of the same favour." This was accorded with more good-will than it was accepted: for Partridge would rather have submitted to the utmost inclemency of the weather than have trusted to the clemency of those whom he took for hobgoblins; and the poor post-boy was now infected with the same apprehensions; but they were both obliged to follow the example of Jones; the one because he durst not leave his horse, and the other because he feared nothing so much as being left by himself.
Had this history been writ in the days of superstition, I should have had too much compassion for the reader to have left him so long in suspense, whether Beelzebub or Satan was about actually to appear in
597
person, with all his hellish retinue; but as these doctrines are at present very unfortunate, and have but few, if any believers, I have not been much aware of conveying any such terrors. To say truth, the whole furniture of the infernal regions hath long been appropriated by the managers of playhouses, who seem lately to have laid them by as rubbish, capable only of affecting the upper gallery; a place in which few of our readers ever sit.
However, though we do not suspect raising any great terror on this occasion, we have reason to fear some other apprehensions may here arise in our reader, into which we would not willingly betray him; I mean that we are going to take a voyage into fairy-land, and introduce a set of beings into our history, which scarce any one was ever childish enough to believe, though many have been foolish enough to spend their time in writing and reading their adventures.
To prevent, therefore, any such suspicions, so prejudicial to the credit of an historian, who professes to draw his materials from nature only, we shall now proceed to acquaint the reader who these people were, whose sudden appearance had struck such terrors into Partridge, had more than half frightened the post-boy, and had a little surprized even Mr Jones himself.
The people then assembled in this barn were no other than a company of Egyptians, or, as they are vulgarly called, gypsies, and they were now celebrating the wedding of one of their society.
It is impossible to conceive a happier set of people than appeared here to be met together. The utmost mirth, indeed, shewed itself in every countenance; nor was their ball totally void of all order and decorum. Perhaps it had more than a country assembly is sometimes conducted with: for these people are subject to a formal government and laws of their own, and all pay obedience to one great magistrate, whom they call their king.
Greater plenty, likewise, was nowhere to be seen than what flourished in this barn. Here was indeed no nicety nor elegance, nor did the keen appetite of the guests require any. Here was good store of bacon, fowls, and mutton, to which every one present provided better sauce himself than the best and dearest French cook can prepare.
Aeneas is not described under more consternation in the temple of Juno,
Dum stupet obtutuque haeret defixus in uno,
598
than was our heroe at what he saw in this barn. While he was looking everywhere round him with astonishment, a venerable person approached him with many friendly salutations, rather of too hearty a kind to be called courtly. This was no other than the king of the gypsies himself. He was very little distinguished in dress from his subjects, nor had he any regalia of majesty to support his dignity; and yet there seemed (as Mr Jones said) to be somewhat in his air which denoted authority, and inspired the beholders with an idea of awe and respect; though all this was perhaps imaginary in Jones; and the truth may be, that such ideas are incident to power, and almost inseparable from it.
There was somewhat in the open countenance and courteous behaviour of Jones which, being accompanied with much comeliness of person, greatly recommended him at first sight to every beholder. These were, perhaps, a little heightened in the present instance, by that profound respect which he paid to the king of the gypsies, the moment he was acquainted with his dignity, and which was the sweeter to his gyp-seian majesty, as he was not used to receive such homage from any but his own subjects.
The king ordered a table to be spread with the choicest of their provisions for his accommodation; and, having placed himself at his right hand, his majesty began to discourse with our heroe in the following manner:—
"Me doubt not, sir, but you have often seen some of my people, who are what you call de parties detache: for dey go about everywhere; but me fancy you imagine not we be so considrable body as we be; and may be you will be surprize more when you hear de gypsy be as orderly and well govern people as any upon face of de earth.
"Me have honour, as me say, to be deir king, and no monarch can do boast of more dutiful subject, ne no more affectionate. How far me deserve deir good-will, me no say; but dis me can say, dat me never design anyting but to do dem good. Me sall no do boast of dat neider: for what can me do oderwise dan consider of de good of dose poor people who go about all day to give me always de best of what dey get. Dey love and honour me darefore, because me do love and take care of dem; dat is all, me know no oder reason.
"About a tousand or two tousand year ago, me cannot tell to a year or two, as can neider write nor read, dere was a great what you call—a volution among de gypsy; for dere was de lord gypsy in dose days; and dese lord did quarrel vid one anoder about de place; but de king of de
599
gypsy did demolish dem all, and made all his subject equal vid each oder; and since dat time dey have agree very well; for dey no tink of being king, and may be it be better for dem as dey be; for me assure you it be ver troublesome ting to be king, and always to do justice; me have often wish to be de private gypsy when me have been forced to punish my dear friend and relation; for dough we never put to death, our punishments be ver severe. Dey make de gypsy ashamed of demselves, and dat be ver terrible punishment; me ave scarce ever known de gypsy so punish do harm any more."
The king then proceeded to express some wonder that there was no such punishment as shame in other governments. Upon which Jones assured him to the contrary; for that there were many crimes for which shame was inflicted by the English laws, and that it was indeed one consequence of all punishment. "Dat be ver strange," said the king; "for me know and hears good deal of your people, dough me no live among dem; and me have often hear dat sham is de consequence and de cause too of many of your rewards. Are your rewards and punishments den de same ting?"
While his majesty was thus discoursing with Jones, a sudden uproar arose in the barn, and as it seems upon this occasion:一the courtesy of these people had by degrees removed all the apprehensions of Partridge, and he was prevailed upon not only to stuff himself with their food, but to taste some of their liquors, which by degrees entirely expelled all fear from his composition, and in its stead introduced much more agreeable sensations.
A young female gypsy, more remarkable for her wit than her beauty, had decoyed the honest fellow aside, pretending to tell his fortune. Now, when they were alone together in a remote part of the barn, whether it proceeded from the strong liquor, which is never so apt to inflame inordinate desire as after moderate fatigue; or whether the fair gypsy herself threw aside the delicacy and decency of her sex, and tempted the youth Partridge with express solicitations; but they were discovered in a very improper manner by the husband of the gypsy, who, from jealousy it seems, had kept a watchful eye over his wife, and had dogged her to the place, where he found her in the arms of her gallant.
To the great confusion of Jones, Partridge was now hurried before the king; who heard the accusation, and likewise the culprit's defence, which was indeed very trifling; for the poor fellow was confounded by the plain evidence which appeared against him, and had very little to say for
600
himself. His majesty, then turning towards Jones, said, "Sir, you have hear what dey say; what punishment do you tink your man deserve?"
Jones answered, "He was sorry for what had happened, and that Partridge should make the husband all the amends in his power: he said, he had very little money about him at that time;" and, putting his hand into his pocket, offered the fellow a guinea. To which he immediately answered, "He hoped his honour would not think of giving him less than five."
This sum, after some altercation, was reduced to two; and Jones, having stipulated for the full forgiveness of both Partridge and the wife, was going to pay the money; when his majesty, restraining his hand, turned to the witness and asked him, "At what time he had discovered the criminals?" To which he answered, "That he had been desired by the husband to watch the motions of his wife from her first speaking to the stranger, and that he had never lost sight of her afterwards till the crime had been committed." The king then asked, "if the husband was with him all that time in his lurking-place?" To which he answered in the affirmative. His Egyptian majesty then addressed himself to the husband as follows: "Me be sorry to see any gypsy dat have no more honour dan to sell de honour of his wife for money. If you had de love for your wife, you would have prevented dis matter, and not endeavour to make her de whore dat you might discover her. Me do order dat you have no money given you, for you deserve punishment, not reward; me do order derefore, dat you be de infamous gypsy, and do wear pair of horns upon your forehead for one month, and dat your wife be called de whore, and pointed at all dat time; for you be de infamous gypsy, but she be no less de infamous whore."
The gypsies immediately proceeded to execute the sentence, and left Jones and Partridge alone with his majesty.
Jones greatly applauded the justice of the sentence: upon which the king, turning to him, said, "Me believe you be surprize: for me suppose you have ver bad opinion of my people; me suppose you tink us all de tieves."
"I must confess, sir," said Jones, "I have not heard so favourable an account of them as they seem to deserve."
"Me vil tell you," said the king, "how the difference is between you and us. My people rob your people, and your people rob one anoder."
Jones afterwards proceeded very gravely to sing forth the happiness of those subjects who live under such a magistrate.
601
Indeed their happiness appears to have been so compleat, that we are aware lest some advocate for arbitrary power should hereafter quote the case of those people, as an instance of the great advantages which attend that government above all others.
And here we will make a concession, which would not perhaps have been expected from us, that no limited form of government is capable of rising to the same degree of perfection, or of producing the same benefits to society, with this. Mankind have never been so happy, as when the greatest part of the then known world was under the dominion of a single master; and this state of their felicity continued during the reigns of five successive princes. 25 This was the true aera of the golden age, and the only golden age which ever had any existence, unless in the warm imaginations of the poets, from the expulsion from Eden down to this day.
In reality, I know but of one solid objection to absolute monarchy. The only defect in which excellent constitution seems to be, the difficulty of finding any man adequate to the office of an absolute monarch: for this indispensably requires three qualities very difficult, as it appears from history, to be found in princely natures: first, a sufficient quantity of moderation in the prince, to be contented with all the power which is possible for him to have. 2ndly, Enough of wisdom to know his own happiness. And, 3rdly, Goodness sufficient to support the happiness of others, when not only compatible with, but instrumental to his own.
Now if an absolute monarch, with all these great and rare qualifications, should be allowed capable of conferring the greatest good on society; it must be surely granted, on the contrary, that absolute power, vested in the hands of one who is deficient in them all, is likely to be attended with no less a degree of evil.
In short, our own religion furnishes us with adequate ideas of the blessing, as well as curse, which may attend absolute power. The pictures of heaven and of hell will place a very lively image of both before our eyes; for though the prince of the latter can have no power but what he originally derives from the omnipotent Sovereign in the former, yet it plainly appears from Scripture that absolute power in his infernal dominions is granted to their diabolical ruler. This is indeed the only absolute power which can by Scripture be derived from heaven. If, therefore, the several tyrannies upon earth can prove any title to a Divine authority, it must be derived from this original grant to the prince of
25.Nerva, Trajan, Adrian, and the two Antonini.
602
darkness; and these subordinate deputations must consequently come immediately from him whose stamp they so expressly bear.
To conclude, as the examples of all ages shew us that mankind in general desire power only to do harm, and, when they obtain it, use it for no other purpose; it is not consonant with even the least degree of prudence to hazard an alteration, where our hopes are poorly kept in countenance by only two or three exceptions out of a thousand instances to alarm our fears. In this case it will be much wiser to submit to a few inconvenien-cies arising from the dispassionate deafness of laws, than to remedy them by applying to the passionate open ears of a tyrant.
Nor can the example of the gypsies, though possibly they may have long been happy under this form of government, be here urged; since we must remember the very material respect in which they differ from all other people, and to which perhaps this their happiness is entirely owing, namely, that they have no false honours among them, and that they look on shame as the most grievous punishment in the world.

Chapter 且 U
A dialogue between Jones and Partridge.
The honest lovers of liberty will, we doubt not, pardon that long digression into which we were led at the close of the last chapter, to prevent our history from being applied to the use of the most pernicious doctrine which priestcraft had ever the wickedness or the impudence to preach.
We will now proceed with Mr Jones, who, when the storm was over, took leave of his Egyptian majesty, after many thanks for his courteous behaviour and kind entertainment, and set out for Coventry; to which place (for it was still dark) a gypsy was ordered to conduct him.
Jones having, by reason of his deviation, travelled eleven miles instead of six, and most of those through very execrable roads, where no expedition could have been made in quest of a midwife, did not arrive at Coventry till near twelve. Nor could he possibly get again into the saddle till past two; for post-horses were now not easy to get; nor were the hostler or post-boy in half so great a hurry as himself, but chose rather to imitate the tranquil disposition of Partridge; who, being denied the nourishment of sleep, took all opportunities to supply its place with every other kind of nourishment, and was never better pleased than when he arrived at an inn, nor ever more dissatisfied than when he was again forced to leave it.
Jones now travelled post; we will follow him, therefore, according to our custom, and to the rules of Longinus, in the same manner. From Coventry he arrived at Daventry, from Daventry at Stratford, and from Stratford at Dunstable, whither he came the next day a little after noon, and within a few hours after Sophia had left it; and though he was obliged to stay here longer than he wished, while a smith, with great deliberation, shoed the post-horse he was to ride, he doubted not but to overtake his Sophia before she should set out from St Albans; at which place
604
he concluded, and very reasonably, that his lordship would stop and dine.
And had he been right in this conjecture, he most probably would have overtaken his angel at the aforesaid place; but unluckily my lord had appointed a dinner to be prepared for him at his own house in London, and, in order to enable him to reach that place in proper time, he had ordered a relay of horses to meet him at St Albans. When Jones therefore arrived there, he was informed that the coach-and-six had set out two hours before.
If fresh post-horses had been now ready, as they were not, it seemed so apparently impossible to overtake the coach before it reached London, that Partridge thought he had now a proper opportunity to remind his friend of a matter which he seemed entirely to have forgotten; what this was the reader will guess, when we inform him that Jones had eat nothing more than one poached egg since he had left the alehouse where he had first met the guide returning from Sophia; for with the gypsies he had feasted only his understanding.
The landlord so entirely agreed with the opinion of Mr Partridge, that he no sooner heard the latter desire his friend to stay and dine, than he very readily put in his word, and retracting his promise before given of furnishing the horses immediately, he assured Mr Jones he would lose no time in bespeaking a dinner, which, he said, could be got ready sooner than it was possible to get the horses up from grass, and to prepare them for their journey by a feed of corn.
Jones was at length prevailed on, chiefly by the latter argument of the landlord; and now a joint of mutton was put down to the fire. While this was preparing, Partridge, being admitted into the same apartment with his friend or master, began to harangue in the following manner.
"Certainly, sir, if ever man deserved a young lady, you deserve young Madam Western; for what a vast quantity of love must a man have, to be able to live upon it without any other food, as you do? I am positive I have eat thirty times as much within these last twenty-four hours as your honour, and yet I am almost famished; for nothing makes a man so hungry as travelling, especially in this cold raw weather. And yet I can't tell how it is, but your honour is seemingly in perfect good health, and you never looked better nor fresher in your life. It must be certainly love that you live upon."
605
"And a very rich diet too, Partridge," answered Jones. "But did not fortune send me an excellent dainty yesterday? Dost thou imagine I cannot live more than twenty-four hours on this dear pocket-book?"
"Undoubtedly," cries Partridge, "there is enough in that pocket-book to purchase many a good meal. Fortune sent it to your honour very opportunely for present use, as your honour's money must be almost out by this time."
"What do you mean?" answered Jones; "I hope you don't imagine that I should be dishonest enough, even if it belonged to any other person, besides Miss Western-----"
"Dishonest!" replied Partridge, "heaven forbid I should wrong your honour so much! but where's the dishonesty in borrowing a little for present spending, since you will be so well able to pay the lady hereafter? No, indeed, I would have your honour pay it again, as soon as it is convenient, by all means; but where can be the harm in making use of it now you want it? Indeed, if it belonged to a poor body, it would be another thing; but so great a lady, to be sure, can never want it, especially now as she is along with a lord, who, it can't be doubted, will let her have whatever she hath need of. Besides, if she should want a little, she can't want the whole, therefore I would give her a little; but I would be hanged before I mentioned the having found it at first, and before I got some money of my own; for London, I have heard, is the very worst of places to be in without money. Indeed, if I had not known to whom it belonged, I might have thought it was the devil's money, and have been afraid to use it; but as you know otherwise, and came honestly by it, it would be an affront to fortune to part with it all again, at the very time when you want it most; you can hardly expect she should ever do you such another good turn; for fortuna nunquam perpetuo est bona. You will do as you please, notwithstanding all I say; but for my part, I would be hanged before I mentioned a word of the matter."
"By what I can see, Partridge," cries Jones, "hanging is a matter non longe alienum a Scaevolae studiis.'' "You should say alienus,'' says Partridge,一"I remember the passage; it is an example under communis, alienus, immunis, variis casibus serviunt.'' "If you do remember it," cries Jones, "I find you don't understand it; but I tell thee, friend, in plain English, that he who finds another's property, and wilfully detains it from the known owner, deserves, in foro conscientiae, to be hanged, no less than if he had stolen it. And as for this very identical bill, which is the property of my angel, and was once in her dear possession, I will not deliver
606
it into any hands but her own, upon any consideration whatever, no, though I was as hungry as thou art, and had no other means to satisfy my craving appetite; this I hope to do before I sleep; but if it should happen otherwise, I charge thee, if thou would'st not incur my displeasure for ever, not to shock me any more by the bare mention of such detestable baseness."
"I should not have mentioned it now," cries Partridge, "if it had appeared so to me; for I'm sure I scorn any wickedness as much as another; but perhaps you know better; and yet I might have imagined that I should not have lived so many years, and have taught school so long, without being able to distinguish between fas et nefas; but it seems we are all to live and learn. I remember my old schoolmaster, who was a prodigious great scholar, used often to say, Polly matete cry town is my daskalon. The English of which, he told us, was, That a child may sometimes teach his grandmother to suck eggs. I have lived to a fine purpose, truly, if I am to be taught my grammar at this time of day. Perhaps, young gentleman, you may change your opinion, if you live to my years: for I remember I thought myself as wise when I was a stripling of one or two and twenty as I am now. I am sure I always taught alienus, and my master read it so before me."
There were not many instances in which Partridge could provoke Jones, nor were there many in which Partridge himself could have been hurried out of his respect. Unluckily, however, they had both hit on one of these. We have already seen Partridge could not bear to have his learning attacked, nor could Jones bear some passage or other in the foregoing speech. And now, looking upon his companion with a contemptuous and disdainful air (a thing not usual with him), he cried, "Partridge, I see thou art a conceited old fool, and I wish thou art not likewise an old rogue. Indeed, if I was as well convinced of the latter as I am of the former, thou should'st travel no farther in my company."
The sage pedagogue was contented with the vent which he had already given to his indignation; and, as the vulgar phrase is, immediately drew in his horns. He said, he was sorry he had uttered anything which might give offence, for that he had never intended it; but Nemo omnibus horis sapit.
As Jones had the vices of a warm disposition, he was entirely free from those of a cold one; and if his friends must have confest his temper to have been a little too easily ruffled, his enemies must at the same time have confest, that it as soon subsided; nor did it at all resemble the sea,
607
whose swelling is more violent and dangerous after a storm is over than while the storm itself subsists. He instantly accepted the submission of Partridge, shook him by the hand, and with the most benign aspect imaginable, said twenty kind things, and at the same time very severely condemned himself, though not half so severely as he will most probably be condemned by many of our good readers.
Partridge was now highly comforted, as his fears of having offended were at once abolished, and his pride completely satisfied by Jones having owned himself in the wrong, which submission he instantly applied to what had principally nettled him, and repeated in a muttering voice, "To be sure, sir, your knowledge may be superior to mine in some things; but as to the grammar, I think I may challenge any man living. I think, at least, I have that at my finger's end."
If anything could add to the satisfaction which the poor man now enjoyed, he received this addition by the arrival of an excellent shoulder of mutton, that at this instant came smoaking to the table. On which, having both plentifully feasted, they again mounted their horses, and set forward for London.

What happened to Mr Jones in his journey from St Albans.
They were got about two miles beyond Barnet, and it was now the dusk of the evening, when a genteel-looking man, but upon a very shabby horse, rode up to Jones, and asked him whether he was going to London; to which Jones answered in the affirmative. The gentleman replied, "I should be obliged to you, sir, if you will accept of my company; for it is very late, and I am a stranger to the road." Jones readily complied with the request; and on they travelled together, holding that sort of discourse which is usual on such occasions.
Of this, indeed, robbery was the principal topic: upon which subject the stranger expressed great apprehensions; but Jones declared he had very little to lose, and consequently as little to fear. Here Partridge could not forbear putting in his word. "Your honour," said he, "may think it a little, but I am sure, if I had a hundred-pound bank-note in my pocket, as you have, I should be very sorry to lose it; but, for my part, I never was less afraid in my life; for we are four of us, and if we all stand by one another, the best man in England can't rob us. Suppose he should have a pistol, he can kill but one of us, and a man can die but once.—That's my comfort, a man can die but once."
Besides the reliance on superior numbers, a kind of valour which hath raised a certain nation among the moderns to a high pitch of glory, there was another reason for the extraordinary courage which Partridge now discovered; for he had at present as much of that quality as was in the power of liquor to bestow.
Our company were now arrived within a mile of Highgate, when the stranger turned short upon Jones, and pulling out a pistol, demanded that little bank-note which Partridge had mentioned.
Jones was at first somewhat shocked at this unexpected demand; however, he presently recollected himself, and told the highwayman, all the money he had in his pocket was entirely at his service; and so saying,
609
he pulled out upwards of three guineas, and offered to deliver it; but the other answered with an oath, That would not do. Jones answered coolly, he was very sorry for it, and returned the money into his pocket.
The highwayman then threatened, if he did not deliver the bank-note that moment, he must shoot him; holding his pistol at the same time very near to his breast. Jones instantly caught hold of the fellow's hand, which trembled so that he could scarce hold the pistol in it, and turned the muzzle from him. A struggle then ensued, in which the former wrested the pistol from the hand of his antagonist, and both came from their horses on the ground together, the highwayman upon his back, and the victorious Jones upon him.
The poor fellow now began to implore mercy of the conqueror: for, to say the truth, he was in strength by no means a match for Jones. "Indeed, sir," says he, "I could have had no intention to shoot you; for you will find the pistol was not loaded. This is the first robbery I ever attempted, and I have been driven by distress to this."
At this instant, at about a hundred and fifty yards' distance, lay another person on the ground, roaring for mercy in a much louder voice than the highwayman. This was no other than Partridge himself, who, endeavouring to make his escape from the engagement, had been thrown from his horse, and lay flat on his face, not daring to look up, and expecting every minute to be shot.
In this posture he lay, till the guide, who was no otherwise concerned than for his horses, having secured the stumbling beast, came up to him, and told him his master had got the better of the highwayman.
Partridge leapt up at this news, and ran back to the place where Jones stood with his sword drawn in his hand to guard the poor fellow; which Partridge no sooner saw than he cried out, "Kill the villain, sir, run him through the body, kill him this instant!"
Luckily, however, for the poor wretch, he had fallen into more merciful hands; for Jones having examined the pistol, and found it to be really unloaded, began to believe all the man had told him, before Partridge came up: namely, that he was a novice in the trade, and that he had been driven to it by the distress he mentioned, the greatest indeed imaginable, that of five hungry children, and a wife lying in of the sixth, in the utmost want and misery. The truth of all which the highwayman most vehemently asserted, and offered to convince Mr Jones of it, if he would take the trouble to go to his house, which was not above two miles off;
610
saying, "That he desired no favour, but upon condition of proving all he had all alledged."
Jones at first pretended that he would take the fellow at his word, and go with him, declaring that his fate should depend entirely on the truth of his story. Upon this the poor fellow immediately expressed so much alacrity, that Jones was perfectly satisfied with his veracity, and began now to entertain sentiments of compassion for him. He returned the fellow his empty pistol, advised him to think of honester means of relieving his distress, and gave him a couple of guineas for the immediate support of his wife and his family; adding, "he wished he had more for his sake, for the hundred pound that had been mentioned was not his own."
Our readers will probably be divided in their opinions concerning this action; some may applaud it perhaps as an act of extraordinary humanity, while those of a more saturnine temper will consider it as a want of regard to that justice which every man owes his country. Partridge certainly saw it in that light; for he testified much dissatisfaction on the occasion, quoted an old proverb, and said, he should not wonder if the rogue attacked them again before they reached London.
The highwayman was full of expressions of thankfulness and gratitude. He actually dropt tears, or pretended so to do. He vowed he would immediately return home, and would never afterwards commit such a transgression: whether he kept his word or no, perhaps may appear hereafter.
Our travellers having remounted their horses, arrived in town without encountering any new mishap. On the road much pleasant discourse passed between Jones and Partridge, on the subject of their last adventure: in which Jones exprest a great compassion for those highwaymen who are, by unavoidable distress, driven, as it were, to such illegal courses, as generally bring them to a shameful death: "I mean," said he, "those only whose highest guilt extends no farther than to robbery, and who are never guilty of cruelty nor insult to any person, which is a circumstance that, I must say, to the honour of our country, distinguishes the robbers of England from those of all other nations; for murder is, amongst those, almost inseparably incident to robbery."
"No doubt," answered Partridge, "it is better to take away one's money than one's life; and yet it is very hard upon honest men, that they can't travel about their business without being in danger of these villains. And to be sure it would be better that all rogues were hanged out of the way, than that one honest man should suffer. For my own part, indeed, I
611
should not care to have the blood of any of them on my own hands; but it is very proper for the law to hang them all. What right hath any man to take sixpence from me, unless I give it him? Is there any honesty in such a man?"
"No, surely," cries Jones, "no more than there is in him who takes the horses out of another man's stable, or who applies to his own use the money which he finds, when he knows the right owner."
These hints stopt the mouth of Partridge; nor did he open it again till Jones, having thrown some sarcastical jokes on his cowardice, he offered to excuse himself on the inequality of fire-arms, saying, "A thousand naked men are nothing to one pistol; for though it is true it will kill but one at a single discharge, yet who can tell but that one may be himself?"

An Invocation.
Come, bright love of fame, inspire my glowing breast: not thee I will call, who, over swelling tides of blood and tears, dost bear the heroe on to glory, while sighs of millions waft his spreading sails; but thee, fair, gentle maid, whom Mnesis, happy nymph, first on the banks of Hebrus did produce. Thee, whom Maeonia educated, whom Mantua charmed, and who, on that fair hill which overlooks the proud metropolis of Britain, sat'st, with thy Milton, sweetly tuning the heroic lyre; fill my ravished fancy with the hopes of charming ages yet to come. Foretel me that some tender maid, whose grandmother is yet unborn, hereafter, when, under the fictitious name of Sophia, she reads the real worth which once existed in my Charlotte, shall from her sympathetic breast send forth the heaving sigh. Do thou teach me not only to foresee, but to enjoy, nay, even to feed on future praise. Comfort me by a solemn assurance, that when the little parlour in which I sit at this instant shall be reduced to a worse furnished box, I shall be read with honour by those who never knew nor saw me, and whom I shall neither know nor see.
And thou, much plumper dame, whom no airy forms nor phantoms of imagination cloathe; whom the well-seasoned beef, and pudding richly stained with plums, delight: thee I call: of whom in a treckschuyte, in some Dutch canal, the fat ufrow gelt, impregnated by a jolly merchant of Amsterdam, was delivered: in Grub-street school didst thou suck in the elements of thy erudition. Here hast thou, in thy maturer age, taught poetry to tickle not the fancy, but the pride of the patron. Comedy from thee learns a grave and solemn air; while tragedy storms aloud, and rends th' affrighted theatres with its thunders. To soothe thy wearied limbs in slumber, Alderman History tells his tedious tale; and, again, to awaken thee, Monsieur Romance performs his surprizing tricks of dexterity. Nor less thy well-fed bookseller obeys thy influence. By thy advice the heavy, unread, folio lump, which long had dozed on the dusty shelf, piecemealed into numbers, runs nimbly through the nation. Instructed
614
by thee, some books, like quacks, impose on the world by promising wonders; while others turn beaus, and trust all their merits to a gilded outside. Come, thou jolly substance, with thy shining face, keep back thy inspiration, but hold forth thy tempting rewards; thy shining, chinking heap; thy quickly convertible bank-bill, big with unseen riches; thy often-varying stock; the warm, the comfortable house; and, lastly, a fair portion of that bounteous mother, whose flowing breasts yield redundant sustenance for all her numerous offspring, did not some too greedily and wantonly drive their brethren from the teat. Come thou, and if I am too tasteless of thy valuable treasures, warm my heart with the transporting thought of conveying them to others. Tell me, that through thy bounty, the pratling babes, whose innocent play hath often been interrupted by my labours, may one time be amply rewarded for them.
And now, this ill-yoked pair, this lean shadow and this fat substance, have prompted me to write, whose assistance shall I invoke to direct my pen?
First, Genius; thou gift of Heaven; without whose aid in vain we struggle against the stream of nature. Thou who dost sow the generous seeds which art nourishes, and brings to perfection. Do thou kindly take me by the hand, and lead me through all the mazes, the winding labyrinths of nature. Initiate me into all those mysteries which profane eyes never beheld. Teach me, which to thee is no difficult task, to know mankind better than they know themselves. Remove that mist which dims the intellects of mortals, and causes them to adore men for their art, or to detest them for their cunning, in deceiving others, when they are, in reality, the objects only of ridicule, for deceiving themselves. Strip off the thin disguise of wisdom from self-conceit, of plenty from avarice, and of glory from ambition. Come, thou that hast inspired thy Aristophanes, thy Lucian, thy Cervantes, thy Rabelais, thy Moliere, thy Shakespear, thy Swift, thy Marivaux, fill my pages with humour; till mankind learn the good-nature to laugh only at the follies of others, and the humility to grieve at their own.
And thou, almost the constant attendant on true genius, Humanity, bring all thy tender sensations. If thou hast already disposed of them all between thy Allen and thy Lyttleton, steal them a little while from their bosoms. Not without these the tender scene is painted. From these alone proceed the noble, disinterested friendship, the melting love, the generous sentiment, the ardent gratitude, the soft compassion, the candid opinion; and all those strong energies of a good mind, which fill the
615
moistened eyes with tears, the glowing cheeks with blood, and swell the heart with tides of grief, joy, and benevolence.
And thou, O Learning! (for without thy assistance nothing pure, nothing correct, can genius produce) do thou guide my pen. Thee in thy favourite fields, where the limpid, gently-rolling Thames washes thy Etonian banks, in early youth I have worshipped. To thee, at thy birchen altar, with true Spartan devotion, I have sacrificed my blood. Come then, and from thy vast, luxuriant stores, in long antiquity piled up, pour forth the rich profusion. Open thy Maeonian and thy Mantuan coffers, with whatever else includes thy philosophic, thy poetic, and thy historical treasures, whether with Greek or Roman characters thou hast chosen to inscribe the ponderous chests: give me a while that key to all thy treasures, which to thy Warburton thou hast entrusted.
Lastly, come Experience, long conversant with the wise, the good, the learned, and the polite. Nor with them only, but with every kind of character, from the minister at his levee, to the bailiff in his spunging-house; from the dutchess at her drum, to the landlady behind her bar. From thee only can the manners of mankind be known; to which the recluse pedant, however great his parts or extensive his learning may be, hath ever been a stranger.
Come all these, and more, if possible; for arduous is the task I have undertaken; and, without all your assistance, will, I find, be too heavy for me to support. But if you all smile on my labours I hope still to bring them to a happy conclusion.

Chapter
What befel Mr Jones on his arrival in London.
The learned Dr Misaubin used to say, that the proper direction to him was To Dr Misaubin, in the World; intimating that there were few people in it to whom his great reputation was not known. And, perhaps, upon a very nice examination into the matter, we shall find that this circumstance bears no inconsiderable part among the many blessings of grandeur.
The great happiness of being known to posterity, with the hopes of which we so delighted ourselves in the preceding chapter, is the portion of few. To have the several elements which compose our names, as Sydenham expresses it, repeated a thousand years hence, is a gift beyond the power of title and wealth; and is scarce to be purchased, unless by the sword and the pen. But to avoid the scandalous imputation, while we yet live, of being one whom nobody knows (a scandal, by the bye, as old as the days of Homer 26 ) will always be the envied portion of those, who have a legal title either to honour or estate.
From that figure, therefore, which the Irish peer, who brought Sophia to town, hath already made in this history, the reader will conclude, doubtless, it must have been an easy matter to have discovered his house in London without knowing the particular street or square which he inhabited, since he must have been one whom everybody knows. To say the truth, so it would have been to any of those tradesmen who are accustomed to attend the regions of the great; for the doors of the great are generally no less easy to find than it is difficult to get entrance into them. But Jones, as well as Partridge, was an entire stranger in London; and as he happened to arrive first in a quarter of the town, the inhabitants of which have very little intercourse with the householders of Hanover or Grosvenor-square (for he entered through Gray's-inn-lane), so he rambled about some time before he could even find his way to those
26.See the 2d Odyssey, ver. 175.
617
happy mansions where fortune segregates from the vulgar those magnanimous heroes, the descendants of antient Britons, Saxons, or Danes, whose ancestors, being born in better days, by sundry kinds of merit, have entailed riches and honour on their posterity.
Jones, being at length arrived at those terrestrial Elysian fields, would now soon have discovered his lordship's mansion; but the peer unluckily quitted his former house when he went for Ireland; and as he was just entered into a new one, the fame of his equipage had not yet sufficiently blazed in the neighbourhood; so that, after a successless enquiry till the clock had struck eleven, Jones at last yielded to the advice of Partridge, and retreated to the Bull and Gate in Holborn, that being the inn where he had first alighted, and where he retired to enjoy that kind of repose which usually attends persons in his circumstances.
Early in the morning he again set forth in pursuit of Sophia; and many a weary step he took to no better purpose than before. At last, whether it was that Fortune relented, or whether it was no longer in her power to disappoint him, he came into the very street which was honoured by his lordship's residence; and, being directed to the house, he gave one gentle rap at the door.
The porter, who, from the modesty of the knock, had conceived no high idea of the person approaching, conceived but little better from the appearance of Mr Jones, who was drest in a suit of fustian, and had by his side the weapon formerly purchased of the serjeant; of which, though the blade might be composed of well-tempered steel, the handle was composed only of brass, and that none of the brightest. When Jones, therefore, enquired after the young lady who had come to town with his lordship, this fellow answered surlily, "That there were no ladies there." Jones then desired to see the master of the house; but was informed that his lordship would see nobody that morning. And upon growing more pressing the porter said, "he had positive orders to let no person in; but if you think proper," said he, "to leave your name, I will acquaint his lordship; and if you call another time you shall know when he will see you."
Jones now declared, "that he had very particular business with the young lady, and could not depart without seeing her." Upon which the porter, with no very agreeable voice or aspect, affirmed, "that there was no young lady in that house, and consequently none could he see;" adding, "sure you are the strangest man I ever met with, for you will not take an answer."
618
I have often thought that, by the particular description of Cerberus, the porter of hell, in the 6th Aeneid, Virgil might possibly intend to satirize the porters of the great men in his time; the picture, at least, resembles those who have the honour to attend at the doors of our great men. The porter in his lodge answers exactly to Cerberus in his den, and, like him, must be appeased by a sop before access can be gained to his master. Perhaps Jones might have seen him in that light, and have recollected the passage where the Sibyl, in order to procure an entrance for Aeneas, presents the keeper of the Stygian avenue with such a sop. Jones, in like manner, now began to offer a bribe to the human Cerberus, which a footman, overhearing, instantly advanced, and declared, "if Mr Jones would give him the sum proposed, he would conduct him to the lady." Jones instantly agreed, and was forthwith conducted to the lodging of Mrs Fitzpatrick by the very fellow who had attended the ladies thither the day before.
Nothing more aggravates ill success than the near approach to good. The gamester, who loses his party at piquet by a single point, laments his bad luck ten times as much as he who never came within a prospect of the game. So in a lottery, the proprietors of the next numbers to that which wins the great prize are apt to account themselves much more unfortunate than their fellow-sufferers. In short, these kind of hairbreadth missings of happiness look like the insults of Fortune, who may be considered as thus playing tricks with us, and wantonly diverting herself at our expense.
Jones, who more than once already had experienced this frolicsome disposition of the heathen goddess, was now again doomed to be tantalized in the like manner; for he arrived at the door of Mrs Fitzpatrick about ten minutes after the departure of Sophia. He now addressed himself to the waiting-woman belonging to Mrs Fitzpatrick; who told him the disagreeable news that the lady was gone, but could not tell him whither; and the same answer he afterwards received from Mrs Fitzpatrick herself. For as that lady made no doubt but that Mr Jones was a person detached from her uncle Western, in pursuit of his daughter, so she was too generous to betray her.
Though Jones had never seen Mrs Fitzpatrick, yet he had heard that a cousin of Sophia was married to a gentleman of that name. This, however, in the present tumult of his mind, never once recurred to his memory; but when the footman, who had conducted him from his lordship's, acquainted him with the great intimacy between the ladies, and with their calling each other cousin, he then recollected the story of
619
the marriage which he had formerly heard; and as he was presently convinced that this was the same woman, he became more surprized at the answer which he had received, and very earnestly desired leave to wait on the lady herself; but she as positively refused him that honour.
Jones, who, though he had never seen a court, was better bred than most who frequent it, was incapable of any rude or abrupt behaviour to a lady. When he had received, therefore, a peremptory denial, he retired for the present, saying to the waiting-woman, "That if this was an improper hour to wait on her lady, he would return in the afternoon; and that he then hoped to have the honour of seeing her." The civility with which he uttered this, added to the great comeliness of his person, made an impression on the waiting-woman, and she could not help answering; "Perhaps, sir, you may;" and, indeed, she afterwards said everything to her mistress, which she thought most likely to prevail on her to admit a visit from the handsome young gentleman; for so she called him.
Jones very shrewdly suspected that Sophia herself was now with her cousin, and was denied to him; which he imputed to her resentment of what had happened at Upton. Having, therefore, dispatched Partridge to procure him lodgings, he remained all day in the street, watching the door where he thought his angel lay concealed; but no person did he see issue forth, except a servant of the house, and in the evening he returned to pay his visit to Mrs Fitzpatrick, which that good lady at last condescended to admit.
There is a certain air of natural gentility, which it is neither in the power of dress to give, nor to conceal. Mr Jones, as hath been before hinted, was possessed of this in a very eminent degree. He met, therefore, with a reception from the lady somewhat different from what his apparel seemed to demand; and after he had paid her his proper respects, was desired to sit down.
The reader will not, I believe, be desirous of knowing all the particulars of this conversation, which ended very little to the satisfaction of poor Jones. For though Mrs Fitzpatrick soon discovered the lover (as all women have the eyes of hawks in those matters), yet she still thought it was such a lover, as a generous friend of the lady should not betray her to. In short, she suspected this was the very Mr Blifil, from whom Sophia had flown; and all the answers which she artfully drew from Jones, concerning Mr Allworthy's family, confirmed her in this opinion. She therefore strictly denied any knowledge concerning the place whither Sophia
620
was gone; nor could Jones obtain more than a permission to wait on her again the next evening.
When Jones was departed Mrs Fitzpatrick communicated her suspicion concerning Mr Blifil to her maid; who answered, "Sure, madam, he is too pretty a man, in my opinion, for any woman in the world to run away from. I had rather fancy it is Mr Jones."—"Mr Jones!" said the lady, "what Jones?" For Sophia had not given the least hint of any such person in all their conversation; but Mrs Honour had been much more communicative, and had acquainted her sister Abigail with the whole history of Jones, which this now again related to her mistress.
Mrs Fitzpatrick no sooner received this information, than she immediately agreed with the opinion of her maid; and, what is very unaccountable, saw charms in the gallant, happy lover, which she had overlooked in the slighted squire. "Betty," says she, "you are certainly in the right: he is a very pretty fellow, and I don't wonder that my cousin's maid should tell you so many women are fond of him. I am sorry now I did not inform him where my cousin was; and yet, if he be so terrible a rake as you tell me, it is a pity she should ever see him any more; for what but her ruin can happen from marrying a rake and a beggar against her father's consent? I protest, if he be such a man as the wench described him to you, it is but an office of charity to keep her from him; and I am sure it would be unpardonable in me to do otherwise, who have tasted so bitterly of the misfortunes attending such marriages."
Here she was interrupted by the arrival of a visitor, which was no other than his lordship; and as nothing passed at this visit either new or extraordinary, or any ways material to this history, we shall here put an end to this chapter.

Chapter U
A project of Mrs Fitzpatrick, and her visit to Lady Bellaston.
When Mrs Fitzpatrick retired to rest, her thoughts were entirely taken up by her cousin Sophia and Mr Jones. She was, indeed, a little offended with the former, for the disingenuity which she now discovered. In which meditation she had not long exercised her imagination before the following conceit suggested itself; that could she possibly become the means of preserving Sophia from this man, and of restoring her to her father, she should, in all human probability, by so great a service to the family, reconcile to herself both her uncle and her aunt Western.
As this was one of her most favourite wishes, so the hope of success seemed so reasonable, that nothing remained but to consider of proper methods to accomplish her scheme. To attempt to reason the case with Sophia did not appear to her one of those methods: for as Betty had reported from Mrs Honour, that Sophia had a violent inclination to Jones, she conceived that to dissuade her from the match was an endeavour of the same kind, as it would be very heartily and earnestly to entreat a moth not to fly into a candle.
If the reader will please to remember that the acquaintance which Sophia had with Lady Bellaston was contracted at the house of Mrs Western, and must have grown at the very time when Mrs Fitzpatrick lived with this latter lady, he will want no information, that Mrs Fitzpatrick must have been acquainted with her likewise. They were, besides, both equally her distant relations.
After much consideration, therefore, she resolved to go early in the morning to that lady, and endeavour to see her, unknown to Sophia, and to acquaint her with the whole affair. For she did not in the least doubt, but that the prudent lady, who had often ridiculed romantic love, and indiscreet marriages, in her conversation, would very readily concur in her sentiments concerning this match, and would lend her utmost assistance to prevent it.
622
This resolution she accordingly executed; and the next morning before the sun, she huddled on her cloaths, and at a very unfashionable, unseasonable, unvisitable hour, went to Lady Bellaston, to whom she got access, without the least knowledge or suspicion of Sophia, who, though not asleep, lay at that time awake in her bed, with Honour snoring by her side.
Mrs Fitzpatrick made many apologies for an early, abrupt visit, at an hour when, she said, "she should not have thought of disturbing her ladyship, but upon business of the utmost consequence." She then opened the whole affair, told all she had heard from Betty; and did not forget the visit which Jones had paid to herself the preceding evening.
Lady Bellaston answered with a smile, "Then you have seen this terrible man, madam; pray, is he so very fine a figure as he is represented? for Etoff entertained me last night almost two hours with him. The wench I believe is in love with him by reputation." Here the reader will be apt to wonder; but the truth is, that Mrs Etoff, who had the honour to pin and unpin the Lady Bellaston, had received compleat information concerning the said Mr Jones, and had faithfully conveyed the same to her lady last night (or rather that morning) while she was undressing; on which accounts she had been detained in her office above the space of an hour and a half.
The lady indeed, though generally well enough pleased with the narratives of Mrs Etoff at those seasons, gave an extraordinary attention to her account of Jones; for Honour had described him as a very handsome fellow, and Mrs Etoff, in her hurry, added so much to the beauty of his person to her report, that Lady Bellaston began to conceive him to be a kind of miracle in nature.
The curiosity which her woman had inspired was now greatly increased by Mrs Fitzpatrick, who spoke as much in favour of the person of Jones as she had before spoken in dispraise of his birth, character, and fortune.
When Lady Bellaston had heard the whole, she answered gravely, "Indeed, madam, this is a matter of great consequence. Nothing can certainly be more commendable than the part you act; and I shall be very glad to have my share in the preservation of a young lady of so much merit, and for whom I have so much esteem."
"Doth not your ladyship think," says Mrs Fitzpatrick eagerly, "that it would be the best way to write immediately to my uncle, and acquaint him where my cousin is?"
623
The lady pondered a little upon this, and thus answered一"Why, no, madam, I think not. Di Western hath described her brother to me to be such a brute, that I cannot consent to put any woman under his power who hath escaped from it. I have heard he behaved like a monster to his own wife, for he is one of those wretches who think they have a right to tyrannise over us, and from such I shall ever esteem it the cause of my sex to rescue any woman who is so unfortunate to be under their power.—The business, dear cousin, will be only to keep Miss Western from seeing this young fellow, till the good company, which she will have an opportunity of meeting here, give her a properer turn."
"If he should find her out, madam," answered the other, "your ladyship may be assured he will leave nothing unattempted to come at her."
"But, madam," replied the lady, "it is impossible he should come here—though indeed it is possible he may get some intelligence where she is, and then may lurk about the house—I wish therefore I knew his person.
"Is there no way, madam, by which I could have a sight of him? for, otherwise, you know, cousin, she may contrive to see him here without my knowledge." Mrs Fitzpatrick answered, "That he had threatened her with another visit that afternoon, and that, if her ladyship pleased to do her the honour of calling upon her then, she would hardly fail of seeing him between six and seven; and if he came earlier she would, by some means or other, detain him till her ladyship's arrival."一Lady Bellaston replied, "She would come the moment she could get from dinner, which she supposed would be by seven at farthest; for that it was absolutely necessary she should be acquainted with his person. Upon my word, madam," says she, "it was very good to take this care of Miss Western; but common humanity, as well as regard to our family, requires it of us both; for it would be a dreadful match indeed."
Mrs Fitzpatrick failed not to make a proper return to the compliment which Lady Bellaston had bestowed on her cousin, and, after some little immaterial conversation, withdrew; and, getting as fast as she could into her chair, unseen by Sophia or Honour, returned home.
624
Which consists of visiting.
Mr Jones had walked within sight of a certain door during the whole day, which, though one of the shortest, appeared to him to be one of the longest in the whole year. At length, the clock having struck five, he returned to Mrs Fitzpatrick, who, though it was a full hour earlier than the decent time of visiting, received him very civilly; but still persisted in her ignorance concerning Sophia.
Jones, in asking for his angel, had dropped the word cousin, upon which Mrs Fitzpatrick said, "Then, sir, you know we are related: and, as we are, you will permit me the right of enquiring into the particulars of your business with my cousin." Here Jones hesitated a good while, and at last answered, "He had a considerable sum of money of hers in his hands, which he desired to deliver to her." He then produced the pocketbook, and acquainted Mrs Fitzpatrick with the contents, and with the method in which they came into his hands. He had scarce finished his story, when a most violent noise shook the whole house. To attempt to describe this noise to those who have heard it would be in vain; and to aim at giving any idea of it to those who have never heard the like, would be still more vain: for it may be truly said一
—Non acuta Sic geminant Corybantes aera.
The priests of Cybele do not so rattle their sounding brass.
In short, a footman knocked, or rather thundered, at the door. Jones was a little surprized at the sound, having never heard it before; but Mrs Fitzpatrick very calmly said, that, as some company were coming, she could not make him any answer now; but if he pleased to stay till they were gone, she intimated she had something to say to him.
The door of the room now flew open, and, after pushing in her hoop sideways before her, entered Lady Bellaston, who having first made a very low courtesy to Mrs Fitzpatrick, and as low a one to Mr Jones, was ushered to the upper end of the room.
625
We mention these minute matters for the sake of some country ladies of our acquaintance, who think it contrary to the rules of modesty to bend their knees to a man.
The company were hardly well settled, before the arrival of the peer lately mentioned, caused a fresh disturbance, and a repetition of ceremonials.
These being over, the conversation began to be (as the phrase is) extremely brilliant. However, as nothing past in it which can be thought material to this history, or, indeed, very material in itself, I shall omit the relation; the rather, as I have known some very fine polite conversation grow extremely dull, when transcribed into books, or repeated on the stage. Indeed, this mental repast is a dainty, of which those who are excluded from polite assemblies must be contented to remain as ignorant as they must of the several dainties of French cookery, which are served only at the tables of the great. To say the truth, as neither of these are adapted to every taste, they might both be often thrown away on the vulgar.
Poor Jones was rather a spectator of this elegant scene, than an actor in it; for though, in the short interval before the peer's arrival, Lady Bella-ston first, and afterwards Mrs Fitzpatrick, had addressed some of their discourse to him; yet no sooner was the noble lord entered, than he engrossed the whole attention of the two ladies to himself; and as he took no more notice of Jones than if no such person had been present, unless by now and then staring at him, the ladies followed his example.
The company had now staid so long, that Mrs Fitzpatrick plainly perceived they all designed to stay out each other. She therefore resolved to rid herself of Jones, he being the visitant to whom she thought the least ceremony was due. Taking therefore an opportunity of a cessation of chat, she addressed herself gravely to him, and said, "Sir, I shall not possibly be able to give you an answer to-night as to that business; but if you please to leave word where I may send to you to-morrow一"
Jones had natural, but not artificial good-breeding. Instead therefore of communicating the secret of his lodgings to a servant, he acquainted the lady herself with it particularly, and soon after very ceremoniously withdrew.
He was no sooner gone than the great personages, who had taken no notice of him present, began to take much notice of him in his absence; but if the reader hath already excused us from relating the more brilliant part of this conversation, he will surely be very ready to excuse the
626
repetition of what may be called vulgar abuse; though, perhaps, it may be material to our history to mention an observation of Lady Bellaston, who took her leave in a few minutes after him, and then said to Mrs Fitzpatrick, at her departure, "I am satisfied on the account of my cousin; she can be in no danger from this fellow."
Our history shall follow the example of Lady Bellaston, and take leave of the present company, which was now reduced to two persons; between whom, as nothing passed, which in the least concerns us or our reader, we shall not suffer ourselves to be diverted by it from matters which must seem of more consequence to all those who are at all interested in the affairs of our heroe.

Chapter U
An adventure which happened to Mr Jones at his lodgings, with some account of a young gentleman who lodged there, and of the mistress of the house, and her two daughters.
The next morning, as early as it was decent, Jones attended at Mrs Fitzpatrick's door, where he was answered that the lady was not at home; an answer which surprized him the more, as he had walked backwards and forwards in the street from break of day; and if she had gone out, he must have seen her. This answer, however, he was obliged to receive, and not only now, but to five several visits which he made her that day.
To be plain with the reader, the noble peer had from some reason or other, perhaps from a regard for the lady's honour, insisted that she should not see Mr Jones, whom he looked on as a scrub, any more; and the lady had complied in making that promise to which we now see her so strictly adhere.
But as our gentle reader may possibly have a better opinion of the young gentleman than her ladyship, and may even have some concern, should it be apprehended that, during this unhappy separation from Sophia, he took up his residence either at an inn, or in the street; we shall now give an account of his lodging, which was indeed in a very reputable house, and in a very good part of the town.
Mr Jones, then, had often heard Mr Allworthy mention the gentlewoman at whose house he used to lodge when he was in town. This person, who, as Jones likewise knew, lived in Bond-street, was the widow of a clergyman, and was left by him, at his decease, in possession of two daughters, and of a compleat set of manuscript sermons.
Of these two daughters, Nancy, the elder, was now arrived at the age of seventeen, and Betty, the younger, at that of ten.
628
Hither Jones had despatched Partridge, and in this house he was provided with a room for himself in the second floor, and with one for Partridge in the fourth.
The first floor was inhabited by one of those young gentlemen, who, in the last age, were called men of wit and pleasure about town, and properly enough; for as men are usually denominated from their business or profession, so pleasure may be said to have been the only business or profession of those gentlemen to whom fortune had made all useful occupations unnecessary. Playhouses, coffeehouses, and taverns were the scenes of their rendezvous. Wit and humour were the entertainment of their looser hours, and love was the business of their more serious moments. Wine and the muses conspired to kindle the brightest flames in their breasts; nor did they only admire, but some were able to celebrate the beauty they admired, and all to judge of the merit of such compositions.
Such, therefore, were properly called the men of wit and pleasure; but I question whether the same appellation may, with the same propriety, be given to those young gentlemen of our times, who have the same ambition to be distinguished for parts. Wit certainly they have nothing to do with. To give them their due, they soar a step higher than their predecessors, and may be called men of wisdom and vertu (take heed you do not read virtue). Thus at an age when the gentlemen above mentioned employ their time in toasting the charms of a woman, or in making sonnets in her praise; in giving their opinion of a play at the theatre, or of a poem at Will's or Button's; these gentlemen are considering the methods to bribe a corporation, or meditating speeches for the House of Commons, or rather for the magazines. But the science of gaming is that which above all others employs their thoughts. These are the studies of their graver hours, while for their amusements they have the vast circle of connoisseurship, painting, music, statuary, and natural philosophy, or rather unnatural, which deals in the wonderful, and knows nothing of Nature, except her monsters and imperfections.
When Jones had spent the whole day in vain enquiries after Mrs Fitzpatrick, he returned at last disconsolate to his apartment. Here, while he was venting his grief in private, he heard a violent uproar below-stairs; and soon after a female voice begged him for heaven's sake to come and prevent murder. Jones, who was never backward on any occasion to help the distressed, immediately ran down-stairs; when stepping into the dining-room, whence all the noise issued, he beheld the young gentleman of wisdom and vertu just before mentioned, pinned close to
629
the wall by his footman, and a young woman standing by, wringing her hands, and crying out, "He will be murdered! he will be murdered!" and, indeed, the poor gentleman seemed in some danger of being choaked, when Jones flew hastily to his assistance, and rescued him, just as he was breathing his last, from the unmerciful clutches of the enemy.
Though the fellow had received several kicks and cuffs from the little gentleman, who had more spirit than strength, he had made it a kind of scruple of conscience to strike his master, and would have contented himself with only choaking him; but towards Jones he bore no such respect; he no sooner therefore found himself a little roughly handled by his new antagonist, than he gave him one of those punches in the guts which, though the spectators at Broughton's amphitheatre have such exquisite delight in seeing them, convey but very little pleasure in the feeling.
The lusty youth had no sooner received this blow, than he meditated a most grateful return; and now ensued a combat between Jones and the footman, which was very fierce, but short; for this fellow was no more able to contend with Jones than his master had before been to contend with him.
And now, Fortune, according to her usual custom, reversed the face of affairs. The former victor lay breathless on the ground, and the vanquished gentleman had recovered breath enough to thank Mr Jones for his seasonable assistance; he received likewise the hearty thanks of the young woman present, who was indeed no other than Miss Nancy, the eldest daughter of the house.
The footman, having now recovered his legs, shook his head at Jones, and, with a sagacious look, cried一"O d一n me, I'll have nothing more to do with you; you have been upon the stage, or I'm d一nably mistaken." And indeed we may forgive this his suspicion; for such was the agility and strength of our heroe, that he was, perhaps, a match for one of the first-rate boxers, and could, with great ease, have beaten all the muffled 27 graduates of Mr Broughton's school.
N.B.一Mr Broughton proposes, with proper assistance, to open an academy at his house in the Haymarket, for the instruction of those who are willing to be initiated in the mystery of boxing: where the whole theory and practice of that truly British art, with all the various stops, blows,

cross-buttocks, &amp;c., incident to combatants, will be fully taught and explained; and that persons of quality and distinction may not be deterred from entering into A course of those lectures, they will be given with the utmost tenderness and regard to the delicacy of the frame and constitution of the pupil, for which reason muffles are provided, that will effectually secure them from the inconveniency of black eyes, broken jaws, and bloody noses.
The master, foaming with wrath, ordered his man immediately to strip, to which the latter very readily agreed, on condition of receiving his wages. This condition was presently complied with, and the fellow was discharged.
And now the young gentleman, whose name was Nightingale, very strenuously insisted that his deliverer should take part of a bottle of wine with him; to which Jones, after much entreaty, consented, though more out of complacence than inclination; for the uneasiness of his mind fitted him very little for conversation at this time. Miss Nancy likewise, who was the only female then in the house, her mamma and sister being both gone to the play, condescended to favour them with her company.
When the bottle and glasses were on the table the gentleman began to relate the occasion of the preceding disturbance.
"I hope, sir," said he to Jones, "you will not from this accident conclude, that I make a custom of striking my servants, for I assure you this is the first time I have been guilty of it in my remembrance, and I have passed by many provoking faults in this very fellow, before he could provoke me to it; but when you hear what hath happened this evening, you will, I believe, think me excusable. I happened to come home several hours before my usual time, when I found four gentlemen of the cloth at whist by my fire;一and my Hoyle, sir一my best Hoyle, which cost me a guinea, lying open on the table, with a quantity of porter spilt on one of the most material leaves of the whole book. This, you will allow, was provoking; but I said nothing till the rest of the honest company were gone, and then gave the fellow a gentle rebuke, who, instead of expressing any concern, made me a pert answer, 'That servants must have their diversions as well as other people; that he was sorry for the accident which had happened to the book, but that several of his acquaintance had bought the same for a shilling, and that I might stop as much in his wages, if I pleased.' I now gave him a severer reprimand than before, when the rascal had the insolence to一In short, he imputed my early coming home to------In short, he cast a reflection-He mentioned the
631
name of a young lady, in a manner一in such a manner that incensed me beyond all patience, and, in my passion, I struck him."
Jones answered, "That he believed no person living would blame him; for my part," said he, "I confess I should, on the last-mentioned provocation, have done the same thing."
Our company had not sat long before they were joined by the mother and daughter, at their return from the play. And now they all spent a very chearful evening together; for all but Jones were heartily merry, and even he put on as much constrained mirth as possible. Indeed, half his natural flow of animal spirits, joined to the sweetness of his temper, was sufficient to make a most amiable companion; and notwithstanding the heaviness of his heart, so agreeable did he make himself on the present occasion, that, at their breaking up, the young gentleman earnestly desired his further acquaintance. Miss Nancy was well pleased with him; and the widow, quite charmed with her new lodger, invited him, with the other, next morning to breakfast.
Jones on his part was no less satisfied. As for Miss Nancy, though a very little creature, she was extremely pretty, and the widow had all the charms which can adorn a woman near fifty. As she was one of the most innocent creatures in the world, so she was one of the most chearful. She never thought, nor spoke, nor wished any ill, and had constantly that desire of pleasing, which may be called the happiest of all desires in this, that it scarce ever fails of attaining its ends, when not disgraced by affectation. In short, though her power was very small, she was in her heart one of the warmest friends. She had been a most affectionate wife, and was a most fond and tender mother. As our history doth not, like a newspaper, give great characters to people who never were heard of before, nor will ever be heard of again, the reader may hence conclude, that this excellent woman will hereafter appear to be of some importance in our history.
Nor was Jones a little pleased with the young gentleman himself, whose wine he had been drinking. He thought he discerned in him much good sense, though a little too much tainted with town-foppery; but what recommended him most to Jones were some sentiments of great generosity and humanity, which occasionally dropt from him; and particularly many expressions of the highest disinterestedness in the affair of love. On which subject the young gentleman delivered himself in a language which might have very well become an Arcadian shepherd of old, and which appeared very extraordinary when proceeding from the
632
lips of a modern fine gentleman; but he was only one by imitation, and meant by nature for a much better character.
633

What arrived while the company were at breakfast, with some hints concerning the government of daughters.
Our company brought together in the morning the same good inclinations towards each other, with which they had separated the evening before; but poor Jones was extremely disconsolate; for he had just received information from Partridge, that Mrs Fitzpatrick had left her lodging, and that he could not learn whither she was gone. This news highly afflicted him, and his countenance, as well as his behaviour, in defiance of all his endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manifest indications of a disordered mind.
The discourse turned at present, as before, on love; and Mr Nightingale again expressed many of those warm, generous, and disinterested sentiments upon this subject, which wise and sober men call romantic, but which wise and sober women generally regard in a better light. Mrs Miller (for so the mistress of the house was called) greatly approved these sentiments; but when the young gentleman appealed to Miss Nancy, she answered only, "That she believed the gentleman who had spoke the least was capable of feeling most."
This compliment was so apparently directed to Jones, that we should have been sorry had he passed it by unregarded. He made her indeed a very polite answer, and concluded with an oblique hint, that her own silence subjected her to a suspicion of the same kind: for indeed she had scarce opened her lips either now or the last evening.
"I am glad, Nanny," says Mrs Miller, "the gentleman hath made the observation; I protest I am almost of his opinion. What can be the matter with you, child? I never saw such an alteration. What is become of all your gaiety? Would you think, sir, I used to call her my little prattler? She hath not spoke twenty words this week."
Here their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a maid-servant, who brought a bundle in her hand, which, she said, "was delivered
634
by a porter for Mr Jones." She added, "That the man immediately went away, saying, it required no answer."
Jones expressed some surprize on this occasion, and declared it must be some mistake; but the maid persisting that she was certain of the name, all the women were desirous of having the bundle immediately opened; which operation was at length performed by little Betsy, with the consent of Mr Jones: and the contents were found to be a domino, a mask, and a masquerade ticket.
Jones was now more positive than ever in asserting, that these things must have been delivered by mistake; and Mrs Miller herself expressed some doubt, and said, "She knew not what to think." But when Mr Nightingale was asked, he delivered a very different opinion. "All I can conclude from it, sir," said he, "is, that you are a very happy man; for I make no doubt but these were sent you by some lady whom you will have the happiness of meeting at the masquerade."
Jones had not a sufficient degree of vanity to entertain any such flattering imagination; nor did Mrs Miller herself give much assent to what Mr Nightingale had said, till Miss Nancy having lifted up the domino, a card dropt from the sleeve, in which was written as follows:一
To MR JONES.
The queen of the fairies sends you this; Use her favours not amiss.
Mrs Miller and Miss Nancy now both agreed with Mr Nightingale; nay, Jones himself was almost persuaded to be of the same opinion. And as no other lady but Mrs Fitzpatrick, he thought, knew his lodging, he began to flatter himself with some hopes, that it came from her, and that he might possibly see his Sophia. These hopes had surely very little foundation; but as the conduct of Mrs Fitzpatrick, in not seeing him according to her promise, and in quitting her lodgings, had been very odd and unaccountable, he conceived some faint hopes, that she (of whom he had formerly heard a very whimsical character) might possibly intend to do him that service in a strange manner, which she declined doing by more ordinary methods. To say the truth, as nothing certain could be concluded from so odd and uncommon an incident, he had the greater latitude to draw what imaginary conclusions from it he pleased. As his temper therefore was naturally sanguine, he indulged it on this occasion, and his imagination worked up a thousand conceits, to favour and support his expectations of meeting his dear Sophia in the evening.
Reader, if thou hast any good wishes towards me, I will fully repay them by wishing thee to be possessed of this sanguine disposition of
635
mind; since, after having read much and considered long on that subject of happiness which hath employed so many great pens, I am almost inclined to fix it in the possession of this temper; which puts us, in a manner, out of the reach of Fortune, and makes us happy without her assistance. Indeed, the sensations of pleasure it gives are much more constant as well as much keener, than those which that blind lady bestows; nature having wisely contrived, that some satiety and languor should be annexed to all our real enjoyments, lest we should be so taken up by them, as to be stopt from further pursuits. I make no manner of doubt but that, in this light, we may see the imaginary future chancellor just called to the bar, the archbishop in crape, and the prime minister at the tail of an opposition, more truly happy than those who are invested with all the power and profit of those respective offices.
Mr Jones having now determined to go to the masquerade that evening, Mr Nightingale offered to conduct him thither. The young gentleman, at the same time, offered tickets to Miss Nancy and her mother; but the good woman would not accept them. She said, "she did not conceive the harm which some people imagined in a masquerade; but that such extravagant diversions were proper only for persons of quality and fortune, and not for young women who were to get their living, and could, at best, hope to be married to a good tradesman."-----"A tradesman!"
cries Nightingale, "you shan't undervalue my Nancy. There is not a nobleman upon earth above her merit." "O fie! Mr Nightingale," answered Mrs Miller, "you must not fill the girl's head with such fancies: but if it was her good luck" (says the mother with a simper) "to find a gentleman of your generous way of thinking, I hope she would make a better return to his generosity than to give her mind up to extravagant pleasures. Indeed, where young ladies bring great fortunes themselves, they have some right to insist on spending what is their own; and on that account I have heard the gentlemen say, a man has sometimes a better bargain with a poor wife, than with a rich one.---But let my daughters marry
whom they will, I shall endeavour to make them blessings to their husbands:----1 beg, therefore, I may hear of no more masquerades. Nancy
is, I am certain, too good a girl to desire to go; for she must remember when you carried her thither last year, it almost turned her head; and she did not return to herself, or to her needle, in a month afterwards."
Though a gentle sigh, which stole from the bosom of Nancy, seemed to argue some secret disapprobation of these sentiments, she did not dare openly to oppose them. For as this good woman had all the tenderness, so she had preserved all the authority of a parent; and as her indulgence
636
to the desires of her children was restrained only by her fears for their safety and future welfare, so she never suffered those commands which proceeded from such fears to be either disobeyed or disputed. And this the young gentleman, who had lodged two years in the house, knew so well, that he presently acquiesced in the refusal.
Mr Nightingale, who grew every minute fonder of Jones, was very desirous of his company that day to dinner at the tavern, where he offered to introduce him to some of his acquaintance; but Jones begged to be excused, "as his cloaths," he said, "were not yet come to town."
To confess the truth, Mr Jones was now in a situation, which sometimes happens to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figure than himself. In short, he had not one penny in his pocket; a situation in much greater credit among the antient philosophers than among the modern wise men who live in Lombard-street, or those who frequent White's chocolate-house. And, perhaps, the great honours which those philosophers have ascribed to an empty pocket may be one of the reasons of that high contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid street and chocolate-house.
Now if the antient opinion, that men might live very comfortably on virtue only, be, as the modern wise men just above-mentioned pretend to have discovered, a notorious error; no less false is, I apprehend, that position of some writers of romance, that a man can live altogether on love; for however delicious repasts this may afford to some of our senses or appetites, it is most certain it can afford none to others. Those, therefore, who have placed too great a confidence in such writers, have experienced their error when it was too late; and have found that love was no more capable of allaying hunger, than a rose is capable of delighting the ear, or a violin of gratifying the smell.
Notwithstanding, therefore, all the delicacies which love had set before him, namely, the hopes of seeing Sophia at the masquerade; on which, however ill-founded his imagination might be, he had voluptuously feasted during the whole day, the evening no sooner came than Mr Jones began to languish for some food of a grosser kind. Partridge discovered this by intuition, and took the occasion to give some oblique hints concerning the bank-bill; and, when these were rejected with disdain, he collected courage enough once more to mention a return to Mr Allworthy.
"Partridge," cries Jones, "you cannot see my fortune in a more desperate light than I see it myself; and I begin heartily to repent that I suffered
637
you to leave a place where you was settled, and to follow me. However, I insist now on your returning home; and for the expense and trouble which you have so kindly put yourself to on my account, all the cloaths I left behind in your care I desire you would take as your own. I am sorry I can make you no other acknowledgment."
He spoke these words with so pathetic an accent, that Partridge, among whose vices ill-nature or hardness of heart were not numbered, burst into tears; and after swearing he would not quit him in his distress, he began with the most earnest entreaties to urge his return home. "For heaven's sake, sir," says he, "do but consider; what can your honour do?一how is it possible you can live in this town without money? Do what you will, sir, or go wherever you please, I am resolved not to desert you. But pray, sir, consider一do pray, sir, for your own sake, take it into your consideration; and I'm sure," says he, "that your own good sense will bid you return home."
"How often shall I tell thee," answered Jones, "that I have no home to return to? Had I any hopes that Mr Allworthy's doors would be open to receive me, I want no distress to urge me一nay, there is no other cause upon earth, which could detain me a moment from flying to his presence; but, alas! that I am for ever banished from. His last words were一O, Partridge, they still ring in my ears一his last words were, when he gave me a sum of money一what it was I know not, but considerable I'm sure it was一his last words were一'I am resolved from this day forward, on no account to converse with you any more.'"
Here passion stopt the mouth of Jones, as surprize for a moment did that of Partridge; but he soon recovered the use of speech, and after a short preface, in which he declared he had no inquisitiveness in his temper, enquired what Jones meant by a considerable sum一he knew not how much一and what was become of the money.
In both these points he now received full satisfaction; on which he was proceeding to comment, when he was interrupted by a message from Mr Nightingale, who desired his master's company in his apartment.
When the two gentlemen were both attired for the masquerade, and Mr Nightingale had given orders for chairs to be sent for, a circumstance of distress occurred to Jones, which will appear very ridiculous to many of my readers. This was how to procure a shilling; but if such readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from the want of a thousand pounds, or, perhaps, of ten or twenty, to execute a favourite scheme, they will have a perfect idea of what Mr Jones felt on this
638
occasion. For this sum, therefore, he applied to Partridge, which was the first he had permitted him to advance, and was the last he intended that poor fellow should advance in his service. To say the truth, Partridge had lately made no offer of this kind. Whether it was that he desired to see the bank-bill broke in upon, or that distress should prevail on Jones to return home, or from what other motive it proceeded, I will not determine.

Chapter /
Containing the whole humours of a masquerade.
Our cavaliers now arrived at that temple, where Heydegger, the great Arbiter Deliciarum, the great high-priest of pleasure, presides; and, like other heathen priests, imposes on his votaries by the pretended presence of the deity, when in reality no such deity is there.
Mr Nightingale, having taken a turn or two with his companion, soon left him, and walked off with a female, saying, "Now you are here, sir, you must beat about for your own game."
Jones began to entertain strong hopes that his Sophia was present; and these hopes gave him more spirits than the lights, the music, and the company; though these are pretty strong antidotes against the spleen. He now accosted every woman he saw, whose stature, shape, or air, bore any resemblance to his angel. To all of whom he endeavoured to say something smart, in order to engage an answer, by which he might discover that voice which he thought it impossible he should mistake. Some of these answered by a question, in a squeaking voice, Do you know me? Much the greater number said, I don't know you, sir, and nothing more. Some called him an impertinent fellow; some made him no answer at all; some said, Indeed I don't know your voice, and I shall have nothing to say to you; and many gave him as kind answers as he could wish, but not in the voice he desired to hear.
Whilst he was talking with one of these last (who was in the habit of a shepherdess) a lady in a domino came up to him, and slapping him on the shoulder, whispered him, at the same time, in the ear, "If you talk any longer with that trollop, I will acquaint Miss Western."
Jones no sooner heard that name, than, immediately quitting his former companion, he applied to the domino, begging and entreating her to show him the lady she had mentioned, if she was then in the room.
640
The mask walked hastily to the upper end of the innermost apartment before she spoke; and then, instead of answering him, sat down, and declared she was tired. Jones sat down by her, and still persisted in his entreaties; at last the lady coldly answered, "I imagined Mr Jones had been a more discerning lover, than to suffer any disguise to conceal his mistress from him." "Is she here, then, madam?" replied Jones, with some vehemence. Upon which the lady cried一"Hush, sir, you will be observed. I promise you, upon my honour, Miss Western is not here."
Jones, now taking the mask by the hand, fell to entreating her in the most earnest manner, to acquaint him where he might find Sophia; and when he could obtain no direct answer, he began to upbraid her gently for having disappointed him the day before; and concluded, saying, "Indeed, my good fairy queen, I know your majesty very well, notwithstanding the affected disguise of your voice. Indeed, Mrs Fitzpatrick, it is a little cruel to divert yourself at the expense of my torments."
The mask answered, "Though you have so ingeniously discovered me, I must still speak in the same voice, lest I should be known by others. And do you think, good sir, that I have no greater regard for my cousin, than to assist in carrying on an affair between you two, which must end in her ruin, as well as your own? Besides, I promise you, my cousin is not mad enough to consent to her own destruction, if you are so much her enemy as to tempt her to it."
"Alas, madam!" said Jones, "you little know my heart, when you call me an enemy of Sophia."
"And yet to ruin any one," cries the other, "you will allow, is the act of an enemy; and when by the same act you must knowingly and certainly bring ruin on yourself, is it not folly or madness, as well as guilt? Now, sir, my cousin hath very little more than her father will please to give her; very little for one of her fashion一you know him, and you know your own situation."
Jones vowed he had no such design on Sophia, "That he would rather suffer the most violent of deaths than sacrifice her interest to his desires." He said, "he knew how unworthy he was of her, every way, that he had long ago resolved to quit all such aspiring thoughts, but that some strange accidents had made him desirous to see her once more, when he promised he would take leave of her for ever. No, madam," concluded he, "my love is not of that base kind which seeks its own satisfaction at the expense of what is most dear to its object. I would sacrifice everything to the possession of my Sophia, but Sophia herself."
641
Though the reader may have already conceived no very sublime idea of the virtue of the lady in the mask; and though possibly she may hereafter appear not to deserve one of the first characters of her sex; yet, it is certain, these generous sentiments made a strong impression upon her, and greatly added to the affection she had before conceived for our young heroe.
The lady now, after silence of a few moments, said, "She did not see his pretensions to Sophia so much in the light of presumption, as of imprudence. Young fellows," says she, "can never have too aspiring thoughts. I love ambition in a young man, and I would have you cultivate it as much as possible. Perhaps you may succeed with those who are infinitely superior in fortune; nay, I am convinced there are women-----but don't you think me a strange creature, Mr Jones, to be thus
giving advice to a man with whom I am so little acquainted, and one with whose behaviour to me I have so little reason to be pleased?"
Here Jones began to apologize, and to hope he had not offended in anything he had said of her cousin.一To which the mask answered, "And are you so little versed in the sex, to imagine you can well affront a lady more than by entertaining her with your passion for another woman? If the fairy queen had conceived no better opinion of your gallantry, she would scarce have appointed you to meet her at the masquerade."
Jones had never less inclination to an amour than at present; but gallantry to the ladies was among his principles of honour; and he held it as much incumbent on him to accept a challenge to love, as if it had been a challenge to fight. Nay, his very love to Sophia made it necessary for him to keep well with the lady, as he made no doubt but she was capable of bringing him into the presence of the other.
He began therefore to make a very warm answer to her last speech, when a mask, in the character of an old woman, joined them. This mask was one of those ladies who go to a masquerade only to vent ill-nature, by telling people rude truths, and by endeavouring, as the phrase is, to spoil as much sport as they are able. This good lady, therefore, having observed Jones, and his friend, whom she well knew, in close consultation together in a corner of the room, concluded she could nowhere satisfy her spleen better than by interrupting them. She attacked them, therefore, and soon drove them from their retirement; nor was she contented with this, but pursued them to every place which they shifted to avoid her; till Mr Nightingale, seeing the distress of his friend, at last relieved him, and engaged the old woman in another pursuit.
642
While Jones and his mask were walking together about the room, to rid themselves of the teazer, he observed his lady speak to several masks, with the same freedom of acquaintance as if they had been barefaced. He could not help expressing his surprize at this; saying, "Sure, madam, you must have infinite discernment, to know people in all disguises." To which the lady answered, "You cannot conceive anything more insipid and childish than a masquerade to the people of fashion, who in general know one another as well here as when they meet in an assembly or a drawing-room; nor will any woman of condition converse with a person with whom she is not acquainted. In short, the generality of persons whom you see here may more properly be said to kill time in this place than in any other; and generally retire from hence more tired than from the longest sermon. To say the truth, I begin to be in that situation myself; and if I have any faculty at guessing, you are not much better pleased. I protest it would be almost charity in me to go home for your sake." "I know but one charity equal to it," cries Jones, "and that is to suffer me to wait on you home." "Sure," answered the lady, "you have a strange opinion of me, to imagine, that upon such an acquaintance, I would let you into my doors at this time of night. I fancy you impute the friendship I have shown my cousin to some other motive. Confess honestly; don't you consider this contrived interview as little better than a downright assignation? Are you used, Mr Jones, to make these sudden conquests?" "I am not used, madam," said Jones, "to submit to such sudden conquests; but as you have taken my heart by surprize, the rest of my body hath a right to follow; so you must pardon me if I resolve to attend you wherever you go." He accompanied these words with some proper actions; upon which the lady, after a gentle rebuke, and saying their familiarity would be observed, told him, "She was going to sup with an acquaintance, whither she hoped he would not follow her; for if you should," said she, "I shall be thought an unaccountable creature, though my friend indeed is not censorious: yet I hope you won't follow me; I protest I shall not know what to say if you do."
The lady presently after quitted the masquerade, and Jones, notwithstanding the severe prohibition he had received, presumed to attend her. He was now reduced to the same dilemma we have mentioned before, namely, the want of a shilling, and could not relieve it by borrowing as before. He therefore walked boldly on after the chair in which his lady rode, pursued by a grand huzza, from all the chairmen present, who wisely take the best care they can to discountenance all walking afoot by their betters. Luckily, however, the gentry who attend at the Opera
643
house were too busy to quit their stations, and as the lateness of the hour prevented him from meeting many of their brethren in the street, he proceeded without molestation, in a dress, which, at another season, would have certainly raised a mob at his heels.
The lady was set down in a street not far from Hanover-square, where the door being presently opened, she was carried in, and the gentleman, without any ceremony, walked in after her.
Jones and his companion were now together in a very well-furnished and well-warmed room; when the female, still speaking in her masquerade voice, said she was surprized at her friend, who must absolutely have forgot her appointment; at which, after venting much resentment, she suddenly exprest some apprehension from Jones, and asked him what the world would think of their having been alone together in a house at that time of night? But instead of a direct answer to so important a question, Jones began to be very importunate with the lady to unmask; and at length having prevailed, there appeared not Mrs Fitzpatrick, but the Lady Bellaston herself.
It would be tedious to give the particular conversation, which consisted of very common and ordinary occurrences, and which lasted from two till six o'clock in the morning. It is sufficient to mention all of it that is anywise material to this history. And this was a promise that the lady would endeavour to find out Sophia, and in a few days bring him to an interview with her, on condition that he would then take his leave of her. When this was thoroughly settled, and a second meeting in the evening appointed at the same place, they separated; the lady returned to her house, and Jones to his lodgings.

Chapter V?
Containing a scene of distress, which will appear very extraordinary to most of our readers.
Jones having refreshed himself with a few hours' sleep, summoned Partridge to his presence; and delivering him a bank-note of fifty pounds, ordered him to go and change it. Partridge received this with sparkling eyes, though, when he came to reflect farther, it raised in him some suspicions not very advantageous to the honour of his master: to these the dreadful idea he had of the masquerade, the disguise in which his master had gone out and returned, and his having been abroad all night, contributed. In plain language, the only way he could possibly find to account for the possession of this note, was by robbery: and, to confess the truth, the reader, unless he should suspect it was owing to the generosity of Lady Bellaston, can hardly imagine any other.
To clear, therefore, the honour of Mr Jones, and to do justice to the liberality of the lady, he had really received this present from her, who, though she did not give much into the hackney charities of the age, such as building hospitals, &amp;c., was not, however, entirely void of that Christian virtue; and conceived (very rightly I think) that a young fellow of merit, without a shilling in the world, was no improper object of this virtue.
Mr Jones and Mr Nightingale had been invited to dine this day with Mrs Miller. At the appointed hour, therefore, the two young gentlemen, with the two girls, attended in the parlour, where they waited from three till almost five before the good woman appeared. She had been out of town to visit a relation, of whom, at her return, she gave the following account.
"I hope, gentlemen, you will pardon my making you wait; I am sure if you knew the occasion一I have been to see a cousin of mine, about six miles off, who now lies in.一It should be a warning to all persons (says she, looking at her daughters) how they marry indiscreetly. There is no
645
happiness in this world without a competency. O Nancy! how shall I describe the wretched condition in which I found your poor cousin? she hath scarce lain in a week, and there was she, this dreadful weather, in a cold room, without any curtains to her bed, and not a bushel of coals in her house to supply her with fire; her second son, that sweet little fellow, lies ill of a quinzy in the same bed with his mother; for there is no other bed in the house. Poor little Tommy! I believe, Nancy, you will never see your favourite any more; for he is really very ill. The rest of the children are in pretty good health: but Molly, I am afraid, will do herself an injury: she is but thirteen years old, Mr Nightingale, and yet, in my life, I never saw a better nurse: she tends both her mother and her brother; and, what is wonderful in a creature so young, she shows all the chear-fulness in the world to her mother; and yet I saw her一I saw the poor child, Mr Nightingale, turn about, and privately wipe the tears from her eyes." Here Mrs Miller was prevented, by her own tears, from going on, and there was not, I believe, a person present who did not accompany her in them; at length she a little recovered herself, and proceeded thus: "In all this distress the mother supports her spirits in a surprizing manner. The danger of her son sits heaviest upon her, and yet she endeavours as much as possible to conceal even this concern, on her husband's account. Her grief, however, sometimes gets the better of all her endeavours; for she was always extravagantly fond of this boy, and a most sensible, sweet-tempered creature it is. I protest I was never more affected in my life than when I heard the little wretch, who is hardly yet seven years old, while his mother was wetting him with her tears, beg her to be comforted. 'Indeed, mamma,' cried the child, 'I shan't die; God Almighty, I'm sure, won't take Tommy away; let heaven be ever so fine a place, I had rather stay here and starve with you and my papa than go to it.' Pardon me, gentlemen, I can't help it" (says she, wiping her eyes), "such sensibility and affection in a child.一And yet, perhaps, he is least the object of pity; for a day or two will, most probably, place him beyond the reach of all human evils. The father is, indeed, most worthy of compassion. Poor man, his countenance is the very picture of horror, and he looks like one rather dead than alive. Oh heavens! what a scene did I behold at my first coming into the room! The good creature was lying behind the bolster, supporting at once both his child and his wife. He had nothing on but a thin waistcoat; for his coat was spread over the bed, to supply the want of blankets.一When he rose up at my entrance, I scarce knew him. As comely a man, Mr Jones, within this fortnight, as you ever beheld; Mr Nightingale hath seen him. His eyes sunk, his face pale, with
646
a long beard. His body shivering with cold, and worn with hunger too; for my cousin says she can hardly prevail upon him to eat.一He told me himself in a whisper一he told me一I can't repeat it一he said he could not bear to eat the bread his children wanted. And yet, can you believe it, gentlemen? in all this misery his wife has as good caudle as if she lay in the midst of the greatest affluence; I tasted it, and I scarce ever tasted better.一The means of procuring her this, he said, he believed was sent him by an angel from heaven. I know not what he meant; for I had not spirits enough to ask a single question.
"This was a love-match, as they call it, on both sides; that is, a match between two beggars. I must, indeed, say, I never saw a fonder couple; but what is their fondness good for, but to torment each other?" "Indeed, mamma," cries Nancy, "I have always looked on my cousin Anderson" (for that was her name) "as one of the happiest of women." "I am sure," says Mrs Miller, "the case at present is much otherwise; for any one might have discerned that the tender consideration of each other's sufferings makes the most intolerable part of their calamity, both to the husband and wife. Compared to which, hunger and cold, as they affect their own persons only, are scarce evils. Nay, the very children, the youngest, which is not two years old, excepted, feel in the same manner; for they are a most loving family, and, if they had but a bare competency, would be the happiest people in the world." "I never saw the least sign of misery at her house," replied Nancy; "I am sure my heart bleeds for what you now tell me."一"O child," answered the mother, "she hath always endeavoured to make the best of everything. They have always been in great distress; but, indeed, this absolute ruin hath been brought upon them by others. The poor man was bail for the villain his brother; and about a week ago, the very day before her lying-in, their goods were all carried away, and sold by an execution. He sent a letter to me of it by one of the bailiffs, which the villain never delivered.—What must he think of my suffering a week to pass before he heard of me?"
It was not with dry eyes that Jones heard this narrative; when it was ended he took Mrs Miller apart with him into another room, and, delivering her his purse, in which was the sum of £50, desired her to send as much of it as she thought proper to these poor people. The look which Mrs Miller gave Jones, on this occasion, is not easy to be described. She burst into a kind of agony of transport, and cryed out一"Good heavens! is there such a man in the world?"一But recollecting herself, she said, "Indeed I know one such; but can there be another?" "I hope, madam," cries Jones, "there are many who have common humanity; for to relieve
647
such distresses in our fellow-creatures, can hardly be called more." Mrs Miller then took ten guineas, which were the utmost he could prevail with her to accept, and said, "She would find some means of conveying them early the next morning;" adding, "that she had herself done some little matter for the poor people, and had not left them in quite so much misery as she found them."
They then returned to the parlour, where Nightingale expressed much concern at the dreadful situation of these wretches, whom indeed he knew; for he had seen them more than once at Mrs Miller's. He inveighed against the folly of making oneself liable for the debts of others; vented many bitter execrations against the brother; and concluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate family. "Suppose, madam," said he, "you should recommend them to Mr Allworthy? Or what think you of a collection? I will give them a guinea with all my heart."
Mrs Miller made no answer; and Nancy, to whom her mother had whispered the generosity of Jones, turned pale upon the occasion; though, if either of them was angry with Nightingale, it was surely without reason. For the liberality of Jones, if he had known it, was not an example which he had any obligation to follow; and there are thousands who would not have contributed a single halfpenny, as indeed he did not in effect, for he made no tender of anything; and therefore, as the others thought proper to make no demand, he kept his money in his pocket.
I have, in truth, observed, and shall never have a better opportunity than at present to communicate my observation, that the world are in general divided into two opinions concerning charity, which are the very reverse of each other. One party seems to hold, that all acts of this kind are to be esteemed as voluntary gifts, and, however little you give (if indeed no more than your good wishes), you acquire a great degree of merit in so doing. Others, on the contrary, appear to be as firmly persuaded, that beneficence is a positive duty, and that whenever the rich fall greatly short of their ability in relieving the distresses of the poor, their pitiful largesses are so far from being meritorious, that they have only performed their duty by halves, and are in some sense more contemptible than those who have entirely neglected it.
To reconcile these different opinions is not in my power. I shall only add, that the givers are generally of the former sentiment, and the receivers are almost universally inclined to the latter.
648

Chapter J
Which treats of matters of a very different kind from those in the preceding chapter.
In the evening Jones met his lady again, and a long conversation again ensued between them: but as it consisted only of the same ordinary occurrences as before, we shall avoid mentioning particulars, which we despair of rendering agreeable to the reader; unless he is one whose devotion to the fair sex, like that of the papists to their saints, wants to be raised by the help of pictures. But I am so far from desiring to exhibit such pictures to the public, that I would wish to draw a curtain over those that have been lately set forth in certain French novels; very bungling copies of which have been presented us here under the name of translations.
Jones grew still more and more impatient to see Sophia; and finding, after repeated interviews with Lady Bellaston, no likelihood of obtaining this by her means (for, on the contrary, the lady began to treat even the mention of the name of Sophia with resentment), he resolved to try some other method. He made no doubt but that Lady Bellaston knew where his angel was, so he thought it most likely that some of her servants should be acquainted with the same secret. Partridge therefore was employed to get acquainted with those servants, in order to fish this secret out of them.
Few situations can be imagined more uneasy than that to which his poor master was at present reduced; for besides the difficulties he met with in discovering Sophia, besides the fears he had of having disobliged her, and the assurances he had received from Lady Bellaston of the resolution which Sophia had taken against him, and of her having purposely concealed herself from him, which he had sufficient reason to believe might be true; he had still a difficulty to combat which it was not in the power of his mistress to remove, however kind her inclination might have been. This was the exposing of her to be disinherited of all her
649
father's estate, the almost inevitable consequence of their coming together without a consent, which he had no hopes of ever obtaining.
Add to all these the many obligations which Lady Bellaston, whose violent fondness we can no longer conceal, had heaped upon him; so that by her means he was now become one of the best-dressed men about town; and was not only relieved from those ridiculous distresses we have before mentioned, but was actually raised to a state of affluence beyond what he had ever known.
Now, though there are many gentlemen who very well reconcile it to their consciences to possess themselves of the whole fortune of a woman, without making her any kind of return; yet to a mind, the proprietor of which doth not deserved to be hanged, nothing is, I believe, more irksome than to support love with gratitude only; especially where inclination pulls the heart a contrary way. Such was the unhappy case of Jones; for though the virtuous love he bore to Sophia, and which left very little affection for any other woman, had been entirely out of the question, he could never have been able to have made any adequate return to the generous passion of this lady, who had indeed been once an object of desire, but was now entered at least into the autumn of life, though she wore all the gaiety of youth, both in her dress and manner; nay, she contrived still to maintain the roses in her cheeks; but these, like flowers forced out of season by art, had none of that lively blooming freshness with which Nature, at the proper time, bedecks her own productions. She had, besides, a certain imperfection, which renders some flowers, though very beautiful to the eye, very improper to be placed in a wilderness of sweets, and what above all others is most disagreeable to the breath of love.
Though Jones saw all these discouragements on the one side, he felt his obligations full as strongly on the other; nor did he less plainly discern the ardent passion whence those obligations proceeded, the extreme violence of which if he failed to equal, he well knew the lady would think him ungrateful; and, what is worse, he would have thought himself so. He knew the tacit consideration upon which all her favours were conferred; and as his necessity obliged him to accept them, so his honour, he concluded, forced him to pay the price. This therefore he resolved to do, whatever misery it cost him, and to devote himself to her, from that great principle of justice, by which the laws of some countries oblige a debtor, who is no otherwise capable of discharging his debt, to become the slave of his creditor.
650
While he was meditating on these matters, he received the following note from the lady:一
"A very foolish, but a very perverse accident hath happened since our last meeting, which makes it improper I should see you any more at the usual place. I will, if possible, contrive some other place by to-morrow. In the meantime, adieu."
This disappointment, perhaps, the reader may conclude was not very great; but if it was, he was quickly relieved; for in less than an hour afterwards another note was brought him from the same hand, which contained as follows:一
"I have altered my mind since I wrote; a change which, if you are no stranger to the tenderest of all passions, you will not wonder at. I am now resolved to see you this evening at my own house, whatever may be the consequence. Come to me exactly at seven; I dine abroad, but will be at home by that time. A day, I find, to those that sincerely love, seems longer than I imagined.
"If you should accidentally be a few moments before me, bid them show you into the drawing-room."
To confess the truth, Jones was less pleased with this last epistle than he had been with the former, as he was prevented by it from complying with the earnest entreaties of Mr Nightingale, with whom he had now contracted much intimacy and friendship. These entreaties were to go with that young gentleman and his company to a new play, which was to be acted that evening, and which a very large party had agreed to damn, from some dislike they had taken to the author, who was a friend to one of Mr Nightingale's acquaintance. And this sort of fun, our heroe, we are ashamed to confess, would willingly have preferred to the above kind appointment; but his honour got the better of his inclination.
Before we attend him to this intended interview with the lady, we think proper to account for both the preceding notes, as the reader may possibly be not a little surprized at the imprudence of Lady Bellaston, in bringing her lover to the very house where her rival was lodged.
First, then, the mistress of the house where these lovers had hitherto met, and who had been for some years a pensioner to that lady, was now become a methodist, and had that very morning waited upon her ladyship, and after rebuking her very severely for her past life, had positively declared that she would, on no account, be instrumental in carrying on any of her affairs for the future.
651
The hurry of spirits into which this accident threw the lady made her despair of possibly finding any other convenience to meet Jones that evening; but as she began a little to recover from her uneasiness at the disappointment, she set her thoughts to work, when luckily it came into her head to propose to Sophia to go to the play, which was immediately consented to, and a proper lady provided for her companion. Mrs Honour was likewise despatched with Mrs Etoff on the same errand of pleasure; and thus her own house was left free for the safe reception of Mr Jones, with whom she promised herself two or three hours of uninterrupted conversation after her return from the place where she dined, which was at a friend's house in a pretty distant part of the town, near her old place of assignation, where she had engaged herself before she was well apprized of the revolution that had happened in the mind and morals of her late confidante.

Chapter A Vx
A chapter which, though short, may draw tears from some eyes.
Mr Jones was just dressed to wait on Lady Bellaston, when Mrs Miller rapped at his door; and, being admitted, very earnestly desired his company below-stairs, to drink tea in the parlour.
Upon his entrance into the room, she presently introduced a person to him, saying, "This, sir, is my cousin, who hath been so greatly beholden to your goodness, for which he begs to return you his sincerest thanks."
The man had scarce entered upon that speech which Mrs Miller had so kindly prefaced, when both Jones and he, looking stedfastly at each other, showed at once the utmost tokens of surprize. The voice of the latter began instantly to faulter; and, instead of finishing his speech, he sunk down into a chair, crying, "It is so, I am convinced it is so!"
"Bless me! what's the meaning of this?" cries Mrs Miller; "you are not ill, I hope, cousin? Some water, a dram this instant."
"Be not frighted, madam," cries Jones, "I have almost as much need of a dram as your cousin. We are equally surprized at this unexpected meeting. Your cousin is an acquaintance of mine, Mrs Miller."
"An acquaintance!" cries the man.一"Oh, heaven!"
"Ay, an acquaintance," repeated Jones, "and an honoured acquaintance too. When I do not love and honour the man who dares venture everything to preserve his wife and children from instant destruction, may I have a friend capable of disowning me in adversity!"
"Oh, you are an excellent young man," cries Mrs Miller:一"Yes, indeed, poor creature! he hath ventured everything.一If he had not had one of the best of constitutions, it must have killed him."
"Cousin," cries the man, who had now pretty well recovered himself, "this is the angel from heaven whom I meant. This is he to whom, before I saw you, I owed the preservation of my Peggy. He it was to whose generosity every comfort, every support which I have procured for her, was
653
owing. He is, indeed, the worthiest, bravest, noblest; of all human beings. O cousin, I have obligations to this gentleman of such a nature!"
"Mention nothing of obligations," cries Jones eagerly; "not a word, I insist upon it, not a word" (meaning, I suppose, that he would not have him betray the affair of the robbery to any person). "If, by the trifle you have received from me, I have preserved a whole family, sure pleasure was never bought so cheap."
"Oh, sir!" cries the man, "I wish you could this instant see my house. If any person had ever a right to the pleasure you mention, I am convinced it is yourself. My cousin tells me she acquainted you with the distress in which she found us. That, sir, is all greatly removed, and chiefly by your goodness.-----My children have now a bed to lie on-----------and they
have-----they have-----eternal blessings reward you for it!--they have
bread to eat. My little boy is recovered; my wife is out of danger, and I am happy. All, all owing to you, sir, and to my cousin here, one of the best of women. Indeed, sir, I must see you at my house.一Indeed my wife must see you, and thank you.一My children too must express their gratitude.----Indeed, sir, they are not without a sense of their obliga-
tion; but what is my feeling when I reflect to whom I owe that they are now capable of expressing their gratitude.-----Oh, sir, the little hearts
which you have warmed had now been cold as ice without your assistance."
Here Jones attempted to prevent the poor man from proceeding; but indeed the overflowing of his own heart would of itself have stopped his words. And now Mrs Miller likewise began to pour forth thanksgivings, as well in her own name, as in that of her cousin, and concluded with saying, "She doubted not but such goodness would meet a glorious reward."
Jones answered, "He had been sufficiently rewarded already. Your cousin's account, madam," said he, "hath given me a sensation more pleasing than I have ever known. He must be a wretch who is unmoved at hearing such a story; how transporting then must be the thought of having happily acted a part in this scene! If there are men who cannot feel the delight of giving happiness to others, I sincerely pity them, as they are incapable of tasting what is, in my opinion, a greater honour, a higher interest, and a sweeter pleasure than the ambitious, the avaricious, or the voluptuous man can ever obtain."
The hour of appointment being now come, Jones was forced to take a hasty leave, but not before he had heartily shaken his friend by the hand,
654
and desired to see him again as soon as possible; promising that he would himself take the first opportunity of visiting him at his own house. He then stept into his chair, and proceeded to Lady Bellaston's, greatly exulting in the happiness which he had procured to this poor family; nor could he forbear reflecting, without horror, on the dreadful consequences which must have attended them, had he listened rather to the voice of strict justice than to that of mercy, when he was attacked on the high road.
Mrs Miller sung forth the praises of Jones during the whole evening, in which Mr Anderson, while he stayed, so passionately accompanied her, that he was often on the very point of mentioning the circumstance of the robbery. However, he luckily recollected himself, and avoided an indiscretion which would have been so much the greater, as he knew Mrs Miller to be extremely strict and nice in her principles. He was likewise well apprized of the loquacity of this lady; and yet such was his gratitude, that it had almost got the better both of discretion and shame, and made him publish that which would have defamed his own character, rather than omit any circumstances which might do the fullest honour to his benefactor.
655
In which the reader will be surprized.
Mr Jones was rather earlier than the time appointed, and earlier than the lady; whose arrival was hindered, not only by the distance of the place where she dined, but by some other cross accidents very vexatious to one in her situation of mind. He was accordingly shown into the drawing-room, where he had not been many minutes before the door opened, and in came-----no other than Sophia herself, who had left the
play before the end of the first act; for this, as we have already said, being, a new play, at which two large parties met, the one to damn, and the other to applaud, a violent uproar, and an engagement between the two parties, had so terrified our heroine, that she was glad to put herself under the protection of a young gentleman who safely conveyed her to her chair.
As Lady Bellaston had acquainted her that she should not be at home till late, Sophia, expecting to find no one in the room, came hastily in, and went directly to a glass which almost fronted her, without once looking towards the upper end of the room, where the statue of Jones now stood motionless.一In this glass it was, after contemplating her own lovely face, that she first discovered the said statue; when, instantly turning about, she perceived the reality of the vision: upon which she gave a violent scream, and scarce preserved herself from fainting, till Jones was able to move to her, and support her in his arms.
To paint the looks or thoughts of either of these lovers, is beyond my power. As their sensations, from their mutual silence, may be judged to have been too big for their own utterance, it cannot be supposed that I should be able to express them: and the misfortune is, that few of my readers have been enough in love to feel by their own hearts what past at this time in theirs.
After a short pause, Jones, with faultering accents, said一"I see, madam, you are surprized."一"Surprized!" answered she; "Oh heavens!
656
Indeed, I am surprized. I almost doubt whether you are the person you seem."一"Indeed," cries he, "my Sophia, pardon me, madam, for this once calling you so, I am that very wretched Jones, whom fortune, after so many disappointments, hath, at last, kindly conducted to you. Oh! my Sophia, did you know the thousand torments I have suffered in this long, fruitless pursuit."一"Pursuit of whom?" said Sophia, a little recollecting herself, and assuming a reserved air.一"Can you be so cruel to ask that question?" cries Jones; "Need I say, of you?" "Of me!" answered Sophia: "Hath Mr Jones, then, any such important business with me?"一"To some, madam," cries Jones, "this might seem an important business" (giving her the pocket-book). "I hope, madam, you will find it of the same value as when it was lost." Sophia took the pocket-book, and was going to speak, when he interrupted her thus:一"Let us not, I beseech you, lose one of these precious moments which fortune hath so kindly sent us. O, my Sophia! I have business of a much superior kind. Thus, on my knees, let me ask your pardon."一"My pardon!" cries she; "Sure, sir, after what is past, you cannot expect, after what I have heard."一"I scarce know what I say," answered Jones. "By heavens! I scarce wish you should pardon me. O my Sophia! henceforth never cast away a thought on such a wretch as I am. If any remembrance of me should ever intrude to give a moment's uneasiness to that tender bosom, think of my unworthiness; and let the remembrance of what passed at Upton blot me for ever from your mind."
Sophia stood trembling all this while. Her face was whiter than snow, and her heart was throbbing through her stays. But, at the mention of Upton, a blush arose in her cheeks, and her eyes, which before she had scarce lifted up, were turned upon Jones with a glance of disdain. He understood this silent reproach, and replied to it thus: "O my Sophia! my only love! you cannot hate or despise me more for what happened there than I do myself; but yet do me the justice to think that my heart was never unfaithful to you. That had no share in the folly I was guilty of; it was even then unalterably yours. Though I despaired of possessing you, nay, almost of ever seeing you more, I doated still on your charming idea, and could seriously love no other woman. But if my heart had not been engaged, she, into whose company I accidently fell at that cursed place, was not an object of serious love. Believe me, my angel, I never have seen her from that day to this; and never intend or desire to see her again." Sophia, in her heart, was very glad to hear this; but forcing into her face an air of more coldness than she had yet assumed, "Why," said she, "Mr Jones, do you take the trouble to make a defence where you are
657
not accused? If I thought it worth while to accuse you, I have a charge of unpardonable nature indeed."一"What is it, for heaven's sake?" answered Jones, trembling and pale, expecting to hear of his amour with Lady Bel-laston. "Oh," said she, "how is it possible! can everything noble and everything base be lodged together in the same bosom?" Lady Bellaston, and the ignominious circumstance of having been kept, rose again in his mind, and stopt his mouth from any reply. "Could I have expected," proceeded Sophia, "such treatment from you? Nay, from any gentleman, from any man of honour? To have my name traduced in public; in inns, among the meanest vulgar! to have any little favours that my unguarded heart may have too lightly betrayed me to grant, boasted of there! nay, even to hear that you had been forced to fly from my love!"
Nothing could equal Jones's surprize at these words of Sophia; but yet, not being guilty, he was much less embarrassed how to defend himself than if she had touched that tender string at which his conscience had been alarmed. By some examination he presently found, that her supposing him guilty of so shocking an outrage against his love, and her reputation, was entirely owing to Partridge's talk at the inns before landlords and servants; for Sophia confessed to him it was from them that she received her intelligence. He had no very great difficulty to make her believe that he was entirely innocent of an offence so foreign to his character; but she had a great deal to hinder him from going instantly home, and putting Partridge to death, which he more than once swore he would do. This point being cleared up, they soon found themselves so well pleased with each other, that Jones quite forgot he had begun the conversation with conjuring her to give up all thoughts of him; and she was in a temper to have given ear to a petition of a very different nature; for before they were aware they had both gone so far, that he let fall some words that sounded like a proposal of marriage. To which she replied, "That, did not her duty to her father forbid her to follow her own inclinations, ruin with him would be more welcome to her than the most affluent fortune with another man." At the mention of the word ruin, he started, let drop her hand, which he had held for some time, and striking his breast with his own, cried out, "Oh, Sophia! can I then ruin thee? No; by heavens, no! I never will act so base a part. Dearest Sophia, whatever it costs me, I will renounce you; I will give you up; I will tear all such hopes from my heart as are inconsistent with your real good. My love I will ever retain, but it shall be in silence; it shall be at a distance from you; it shall be in some foreign land; from whence no voice, no sigh of my despair, shall ever reach and disturb your ears. And when I am
658
dead"一He would have gone on, but was stopt by a flood of tears which Sophia let fall in his bosom, upon which she leaned, without being able to speak one word. He kissed them off, which, for some moments, she allowed him to do without any resistance; but then recollecting herself, gently withdrew out of his arms; and, to turn the discourse from a subject too tender, and which she found she could not support, bethought herself to ask him a question she never had time to put to him before, "How he came into that room?" He began to stammer, and would, in all probability, have raised her suspicions by the answer he was going to give, when, at once, the door opened, and in came Lady Bellaston.
Having advanced a few steps, and seeing Jones and Sophia together, she suddenly stopt; when, after a pause of a few moments, recollecting herself with admirable presence of mind, she said一though with sufficient indications of surprize both in voice and countenance一"I thought, Miss Western, you had been at the play?"
Though Sophia had no opportunity of learning of Jones by what means he had discovered her, yet, as she had not the least suspicion of the real truth, or that Jones and Lady Bellaston were acquainted, so she was very little confounded; and the less, as the lady had, in all their conversations on the subject, entirely taken her side against her father. With very little hesitation, therefore, she went through the whole story of what had happened at the play-house, and the cause of her hasty return.
The length of this narrative gave Lady Bellaston an opportunity of rallying her spirits, and of considering in what manner to act. And as the behaviour of Sophia gave her hopes that Jones had not betrayed her, she put on an air of good humour, and said, "I should not have broke in so abruptly upon you, Miss Western, if I had known you had company."
Lady Bellaston fixed her eyes on Sophia whilst she spoke these words. To which that poor young lady, having her face overspread with blushes and confusion, answered, in a stammering voice, "I am sure, madam, I shall always think the honour of your ladyship's company---" "I hope,
at least," cries Lady Bellaston, "I interrupt no business."一"No, madam," answered Sophia, "our business was at an end. Your ladyship may be pleased to remember I have often mentioned the loss of my pocket-book, which this gentleman, having very luckily found, was so kind to return it to me with the bill in it."
Jones, ever since the arrival of Lady Bellaston, had been ready to sink with fear. He sat kicking his heels, playing with his fingers, and looking more like a fool, if it be possible, than a young booby squire, when he is
659
first introduced into a polite assembly. He began, however, now to recover himself; and taking a hint from the behaviour of Lady Bellaston, who he saw did not intend to claim any acquaintance with him, he resolved as entirely to affect the stranger on his part. He said, "Ever since he had the pocket-book in his possession, he had used great diligence in enquiring out the lady whose name was writ in it; but never till that day could be so fortunate to discover her."
Sophia had indeed mentioned the loss of her pocket-book to Lady Bel-laston; but as Jones, for some reason or other, had never once hinted to her that it was in his possession, she believed not one syllable of what Sophia now said, and wonderfully admired the extreme quickness of the young lady in inventing such an excuse. The reason of Sophia's leaving the playhouse met with no better credit; and though she could not account for the meeting between these two lovers, she was firmly persuaded it was not accidental.
With an affected smile, therefore, she said, "Indeed, Miss Western, you have had very good luck in recovering your money. Not only as it fell into the hands of a gentleman of honour, but as he happened to discover to whom it belonged. I think you would not consent to have it advert-ised.一It was great good fortune, sir, that you found out to whom the note belonged."
"Oh, madam," cries Jones, "it was enclosed in a pocket-book, in which the young lady's name was written."
"That was very fortunate, indeed," cries the lady:一"And it was no less so, that you heard Miss Western was at my house; for she is very little known."
Jones had at length perfectly recovered his spirits; and as he conceived he had now an opportunity of satisfying Sophia as to the question she had asked him just before Lady Bellaston came in, he proceeded thus: "Why, madam," answered he, "it was by the luckiest chance imaginable I made this discovery. I was mentioning what I had found, and the name of the owner, the other night to a lady at the masquerade, who told me she believed she knew where I might see Miss Western; and if I would come to her house the next morning she would inform me, I went according to her appointment, but she was not at home; nor could I ever meet with her till this morning, when she directed me to your ladyship's house. I came accordingly, and did myself the honour to ask for your ladyship; and upon my saying that I had very particular business, a
660
servant showed me into this room; where I had not been long before the young lady returned from the play."
Upon his mentioning the masquerade, he looked very slily at Lady Bellaston, without any fear of being remarked by Sophia; for she was visibly too much confounded to make any observations. This hint a little alarmed the lady, and she was silent; when Jones, who saw the agitation of Sophia's mind, resolved to take the only method of relieving her, which was by retiring; but, before he did this, he said, "I believe, madam, it is customary to give some reward on these occasions;一I must insist on a very high one for my honesty;一it is, madam, no less than the honour of being permitted to pay another visit here."
"Sir," replied the lady, "I make no doubt that you are a gentleman, and my doors are never shut to people of fashion."
Jones then, after proper ceremonials, departed, highly to his own satisfaction, and no less to that of Sophia; who was terribly alarmed lest Lady Bellaston should discover what she knew already but too well.
Upon the stairs Jones met his old acquaintance, Mrs Honour, who, notwithstanding all she had said against him, was now so well bred to behave with great civility. This meeting proved indeed a lucky circumstance, as he communicated to her the house where he lodged, with which Sophia was unacquainted.

Chapter 且
In which the thirteenth book is concluded.
The elegant Lord Shaftesbury somewhere objects to telling too much truth: by which it may be fairly inferred, that, in some cases, to lie is not only excusable but commendable.
And surely there are no persons who may so properly challenge a right to this commendable deviation from truth, as young women in the affair of love; for which they may plead precept, education, and above all, the sanction, nay, I may say the necessity of custom, by which they are restrained, not from submitting to the honest impulses of nature (for that would be a foolish prohibition), but from owning them.
We are not, therefore, ashamed to say, that our heroine now pursued the dictates of the above-mentioned right honourable philosopher. As she was perfectly satisfied then, that Lady Bellaston was ignorant of the person of Jones, so she determined to keep her in that ignorance, though at the expense of a little fibbing.
Jones had not been long gone, before Lady Bellaston cryed, "Upon my word, a good pretty young fellow; I wonder who he is; for I don't remember ever to have seen his face before."
"Nor I neither, madam," cries Sophia. "I must say he behaved very handsomely in relation to my note."
"Yes; and he is a very handsome fellow," said the lady: "don't you think so?"
"I did not take much notice of him," answered Sophia, "but I thought he seemed rather awkward, and ungenteel than otherwise."
"You are extremely right," cries Lady Bellaston: "you may see, by his manner, that he hath not kept good company. Nay, notwithstanding his returning your note, and refusing the reward, I almost question whether he is a gentleman.---1 have always observed there is a something in
662
persons well born, which others can never acquire.----1 think I will give
orders not to be at home to him."
"Nay, sure, madam," answered Sophia, "one can't suspect after what he hath done;—besides, if your ladyship observed him, there was an elegance in his discourse, a delicacy, a prettiness of expression that, that——"
"I confess," said Lady Bellaston, "the fellow hath words-----And in-
deed, Sophia, you must forgive me, indeed you must."
"I forgive your ladyship!" said Sophia.
"Yes, indeed you must," answered she, laughing; "for I had a horrible suspicion when I first came into the room----1 vow you must forgive it;
but I suspected it was Mr Jones himself."
"Did your ladyship, indeed?" cries Sophia, blushing, and affecting a laugh.
"Yes, I vow I did," answered she. "I can't imagine what put it into my head: for, give the fellow his due, he was genteely drest; which, I think, dear Sophy, is not commonly the case with your friend."
"This raillery," cries Sophia, "is a little cruel, Lady Bellaston, after my promise to your ladyship."
"Not at all, child," said the lady;-"It would have been cruel before;
but after you have promised me never to marry without your father's consent, in which you know is implied your giving up Jones, sure you can bear a little raillery on a passion which was pardonable enough in a young girl in the country, and of which you tell me you have so entirely got the better. What must I think, my dear Sophy, if you cannot bear a little ridicule even on his dress? I shall begin to fear you are very far gone indeed; and almost question whether you have dealt ingenuously with me."
"Indeed, madam," cries Sophia, "your ladyship mistakes me, if you imagine I had any concern on his account."
"On his account!" answered the lady: "You must have mistaken me; I went no farther than his dress;----for I would not injure your taste by
any other comparison一I don't imagine, my dear Sophy, if your Mr Jones had been such a fellow as this一"
"I thought," says Sophia, "your ladyship had allowed him to be handsome"------
"Whom, pray?" cried the lady hastily.
663
"Mr Jones," answered Sophia;一and immediately recollecting herself, "Mr Jones!一no, no; I ask your pardon;一I mean the gentleman who was just now here."
"O Sophy! Sophy!" cries the lady; "this Mr Jones, I am afraid, still runs in your head."
"Then, upon my honour, madam," said Sophia, "Mr Jones is as entirely indifferent to me, as the gentleman who just now left us."
"Upon my honour," said Lady Bellaston, "I believe it. Forgive me, therefore, a little innocent raillery; but I promise you I will never mention his name any more."
And now the two ladies separated, infinitely more to the delight of Sophia than of Lady Bellaston, who would willingly have tormented her rival a little longer, had not business of more importance called her away. As for Sophia, her mind was not perfectly easy under this first practice of deceit; upon which, when she retired to her chamber, she reflected with the highest uneasiness and conscious shame. Nor could the peculiar hardship of her situation, and the necessity of the case, at all reconcile her mind to her conduct; for the frame of her mind was too delicate to bear the thought of having been guilty of a falsehood, however qualified by circumstances. Nor did this thought once suffer her to close her eyes during the whole succeeding night.

Chapter 且
An essay to prove that an author will write the better for having some knowledge of the subject on which he writes.
As several gentlemen in these times, by the wonderful force of genius only, without the least assistance of learning, perhaps, without being well able to read, have made a considerable figure in the republic of letters; the modern critics, I am told, have lately begun to assert, that all kind of learning is entirely useless to a writer; and, indeed, no other than a kind of fetters on the natural sprightliness and activity of the imagination, which is thus weighed down, and prevented from soaring to those high flights which otherwise it would be able to reach.
This doctrine, I am afraid, is at present carried much too far: for why should writing differ so much from all other arts? The nimbleness of a dancing-master is not at all prejudiced by being taught to move; nor doth any mechanic, I believe, exercise his tools the worse by having learnt to use them. For my own part, I cannot conceive that Homer or Virgil would have writ with more fire, if instead of being masters of all the learning of their times, they had been as ignorant as most of the authors of the present age. Nor do I believe that all the imagination, fire, and judgment of Pitt, could have produced those orations that have made the senate of England, in these our times, a rival in eloquence to Greece and Rome, if he had not been so well read in the writings of Demosthenes and Cicero, as to have transferred their whole spirit into his speeches, and, with their spirit, their knowledge too.
I would not here be understood to insist on the same fund of learning in any of my brethren, as Cicero persuades us is necessary to the composition of an orator. On the contrary, very little reading is, I conceive, necessary to the poet, less to the critic, and the least of all to the politician. For the first, perhaps, Byshe's Art of Poetry, and a few of our modern poets, may suffice; for the second, a moderate heap of plays; and, for the last, an indifferent collection of political journals.
666
To say the truth, I require no more than that a man should have some little knowledge of the subject on which he treats, according to the old maxim of law, Quam quisque norit artem in ea se exerceat. With this alone a writer may sometimes do tolerably well; and, indeed, without this, all the other learning in the world will stand him in little stead.
For instance, let us suppose that Homer and Virgil, Aristotle and Cicero, Thucydides and Livy, could have met all together, and have clubbed their several talents to have composed a treatise on the art of dancing: I believe it will be readily agreed they could not have equalled the excellent treatise which Mr Essex hath given us on that subject, entitled, The Rudiments of Genteel Education. And, indeed, should the excellent Mr Broughton be prevailed on to set fist to paper, and to complete the above-said rudiments, by delivering down the true principles of athletics, I question whether the world will have any cause to lament, that none of the great writers, either antient or modern, have ever treated about that noble and useful art.
To avoid a multiplicity of examples in so plain a case, and to come at once to my point, I am apt to conceive, that one reason why many English writers have totally failed in describing the manners of upper life, may possibly be, that in reality they know nothing of it.
This is a knowledge unhappily not in the power of many authors to arrive at. Books will give us a very imperfect idea of it; nor will the stage a much better: the fine gentleman formed upon reading the former will almost always turn out a pedant, and he who forms himself upon the latter, a coxcomb.
Nor are the characters drawn from these models better supported. Vanbrugh and Congreve copied nature; but they who copy them draw as unlike the present age as Hogarth would do if he was to paint a rout or a drum in the dresses of Titian and of Vandyke. In short, imitation here will not do the business. The picture must be after Nature herself. A true knowledge of the world is gained only by conversation, and the manners of every rank must be seen in order to be known.
Now it happens that this higher order of mortals is not to be seen, like all the rest of the human species, for nothing, in the streets, shops, and coffee-houses; nor are they shown, like the upper rank of animals, for so much a-piece. In short, this is a sight to which no persons are admitted without one or other of these qualifications, viz., either birth or fortune, or, what is equivalent to both, the honourable profession of a gamester. And, very unluckily for the world, persons so qualified very seldom care
667
to take upon themselves the bad trade of writing; which is generally entered upon by the lower and poorer sort, as it is a trade which many think requires no kind of stock to set up with.
Hence those strange monsters in lace and embroidery, in silks and brocades, with vast wigs and hoops; which, under the name of lords and ladies, strut the stage, to the great delight of attorneys and their clerks in the pit, and of the citizens and their apprentices in the galleries; and which are no more to be found in real life than the centaur, the chimera, or any other creature of mere fiction. But to let my reader into a secret, this knowledge of upper life, though very necessary for preventing mistakes, is no very great resource to a writer whose province is comedy, or that kind of novels which, like this I am writing, is of the comic class.
What Mr Pope says of women is very applicable to most in this station, who are, indeed, so entirely made up of form and affectation, that they have no character at all, at least none which appears. I will venture to say the highest life is much the dullest, and affords very little humour or entertainment. The various callings in lower spheres produce the great variety of humorous characters; whereas here, except among the few who are engaged in the pursuit of ambition, and the fewer still who have a relish for pleasure, all is vanity and servile imitation. Dressing and cards, eating and drinking, bowing and courtesying, make up the business of their lives.
Some there are, however, of this rank upon whom passion exercises its tyranny, and hurries them far beyond the bounds which decorum prescribes; of these the ladies are as much distinguished by their noble intrepidity, and a certain superior contempt of reputation, from the frail ones of meaner degree, as a virtuous woman of quality is by the elegance and delicacy of her sentiments from the honest wife of a yeoman and shopkeeper. Lady Bellaston was of this intrepid character; but let not my country readers conclude from her, that this is the general conduct of women of fashion, or that we mean to represent them as such. They might as well suppose that every clergyman was represented by Th-wackum, or every soldier by ensign Northerton.
There is not, indeed, a greater error than that which universally prevails among the vulgar, who, borrowing their opinion from some ignorant satirists, have affixed the character of lewdness to these times. On the contrary, I am convinced there never was less of love intrigue carried on among persons of condition than now. Our present women have been taught by their mothers to fix their thoughts only on ambition and
668
vanity, and to despise the pleasures of love as unworthy their regard; and being afterwards, by the care of such mothers, married without having husbands, they seem pretty well confirmed in the justness of those sentiments; whence they content themselves, for the dull remainder of life, with the pursuit of more innocent, but I am afraid more childish amusements, the bare mention of which would ill suit with the dignity of this history. In my humble opinion, the true characteristic of the present beau monde is rather folly than vice, and the only epithet which it deserves is that of frivolous.

Chapter
Containing letters and other matters which attend amours.
Jones had not been long at home before he received the following letter:一
"I was never more surprized than when I found you was gone. When you left the room I little imagined you intended to have left the house without seeing me again. Your behaviour is all of a piece, and convinces me how much I ought to despise a heart which can doat upon an idiot; though I know not whether I should not admire her cunning more than her simplicity: wonderful both! For though she understood not a word of what passed between us, yet she had the skill, the assurance, the----what shall I call it? to deny to my face that she knows you, or
ever saw you before.----Was this a scheme laid between you, and have
you been base enough to betray me? O how I despise her, you, and all the world, but chiefly myself! for 1 dare not write what I should afterwards run mad to read; but remember, I can detest as violently as I have loved."
Jones had but little time given him to reflect on this letter, before a second was brought him from the same hand; and this, likewise, we shall set down in the precise words.
"When you consider the hurry of spirits in which I must have writ, you cannot be surprized at any expressions in my former note.一Yet, perhaps, on reflection, they were rather too warm. At least I would, if possible, think all owing to the odious playhouse, and to the impertinence of a fool, which detained me beyond my appointment.-----How easy is it to
think well of those we love!---Perhaps you desire I should think so. I
have resolved to see you to-night; so come to me immediately.
"P.S.一I have ordered to be at home to none but yourself.
"P.S.一Mr Jones will imagine I shall assist him in his defence; for I believe he cannot desire to impose on me more than I desire to impose on myself.
670
"P.S.一Come immediately.
To the men of intrigue I refer the determination, whether the angry or the tender letter gave the greatest uneasiness to Jones. Certain it is, he had no violent inclination to pay any more visits that evening, unless to one single person. However, he thought his honour engaged, and had not this been motive sufficient, he would not have ventured to blow the temper of Lady Bellaston into that flame of which he had reason to think it susceptible, and of which he feared the consequence might be a discovery to Sophia, which he dreaded. After some discontented walks therefore about the room, he was preparing to depart, when the lady kindly prevented him, not by another letter, but by her own presence. She entered the room very disordered in her dress, and very discomposed in her looks, and threw herself into a chair, where, having recovered her breath, she said一"You see, sir, when women have gone one length too far, they will stop at none. If any person would have sworn this to me a week ago, I would not have believed it of myself." "I hope, madam," said Jones, "my charming Lady Bellaston will be as difficult to believe anything against one who is so sensible of the many obligations she hath conferred upon him." "Indeed!" says she, "sensible of obligations! Did I expect to hear such cold language from Mr Jones?" "Pardon me, my dear angel," said he, "if, after the letters I have received, the terrors of your anger, though I know not how I have deserved it."一"And have I then," says she, with a smile, "so angry a countenance?一Have I really brought a chiding face with me?"一"If there be honour in man," said he, "I have done nothing to merit your anger.一You remember the appointment you sent me; I went in pursuance."一"I beseech you," cried she, "do not run through the odious recital.—Answer me but one question, and I shall be easy. Have you not betrayed my honour to her?"一Jones fell upon his knees, and began to utter the most violent protestations, when Partridge came dancing and capering into the room, like one drunk with joy, crying out, "She's found! she's found!—Here, sir, here, she's here—Mrs Honour is upon the stairs." "Stop her a moment," cries Jones一"Here, madam, step behind the bed, I have no other room nor closet, nor place on earth to hide you in; sure never was so damned an accident."一"D一n'd indeed!" said the lady, as she went to her place of concealment; and presently afterwards in came Mrs Honour. "Hey-day!" says she, "Mr Jones, what's the matter?一That impudent rascal your servant would scarce let me come upstairs. I hope he hath not the same reason to keep me from you as he had at Upton.一I suppose you hardly expected to see me; but you have certainly bewitched my lady. Poor dear young lady! To
671
be sure, I loves her as tenderly as if she was my own sister. Lord have mercy upon you, if you don't make her a good husband! and to be sure, if you do not, nothing can be bad enough for you." Jones begged her only to whisper, for that there was a lady dying in the next room. "A lady!" cries she; "ay, I suppose one of your ladies.一O Mr Jones, there are too many of them in the world; I believe we are got into the house of one, for my Lady Bellaston I darst to say is no better than she should be."一"Hush! hush!" cries Jones, "every word is overheard in the next room." "I don't care a farthing," cries Honour, "I speaks no scandal of any one; but to be sure the servants make no scruple of saying as how her ladyship meets men at another place一where the house goes under the name of a poor gentlewoman; but her ladyship pays the rent, and many's the good thing besides, they say, she hath of her."一Here Jones, after expressing the utmost uneasiness, offered to stop her mouth:一"Hey-day! why sure, Mr Jones, you will let me speak; I speaks no scandal, for I only says what I heard from others一and thinks I to myself, much good may it do the gentlewoman with her riches, if she comes by it in such a wicked manner. To be sure it is better to be poor and honest." "The servants are villains," cries Jones, "and abuse their lady unjustly."—"Ay, to be sure, servants are always villains, and so my lady says, and won't hear a word of it."一"No, I am convinced," says Jones, "my Sophia is above listening to such base scandal." "Nay, I believe it is no scandal, neither," cries Honour, "for why should she meet men at another house?一It can never be for any good: for if she had a lawful design of being courted, as to be sure any lady may lawfully give her company to men upon that account: why, where can be the sense?"一"I protest," cries Jones, "I can't hear all this of a lady of such honour, and a relation of Sophia; besides, you will distract the poor lady in the next room.一Let me entreat you to walk with me down stairs."一"Nay, sir, if you won't let me speak, I have done.一Here, sir, is a letter from my young lady一what would some men give to have this? But, Mr Jones, I think you are not over and above generous, and yet I have heard some servants say----but I am sure you will do me the justice to own I never saw the
colour of your money." Here Jones hastily took the letter, and presently after slipped five pieces into her hand. He then returned a thousand thanks to his dear Sophia in a whisper, and begged her to leave him to read her letter: she presently departed, not without expressing much grateful sense of his generosity.
Lady Bellaston now came from behind the curtain. How shall I describe her rage? Her tongue was at first incapable of utterance; but
672
streams of fire darted from her eyes, and well indeed they might, for her heart was all in a flame. And now as soon as her voice found way, instead of expressing any indignation against Honour or her own servants, she began to attack poor Jones. "You see," said she, "what I have sacrificed to you; my reputation, my honour一gone for ever! And what return have I found? Neglected, slighted for a country girl, for an idi-ot."一"What neglect, madam, or what slight," cries Jones, "have I been guilty of?"一"Mr Jones," said she, "it is in vain to dissemble; if you will make me easy, you must entirely give her up; and as a proof of your intention, show me the letter."一"What letter, madam?" said Jones. "Nay, surely," said she, "you cannot have the confidence to deny your having received a letter by the hands of that trollop."一"And can your ladyship," cries he, "ask of me what I must part with my honour before I grant? Have I acted in such a manner by your ladyship? Could I be guilty of betraying this poor innocent girl to you, what security could you have that I should not act the same part by yourself? A moment's reflection will, I am sure, convince you that a man with whom the secrets of a lady are not safe must be the most contemptible of wretches."一"Very well," said she一"I need not insist on your becoming this contemptible wretch in your own opinion; for the inside of the letter could inform me of nothing more than I know already. I see the footing you are upon."一Here ensued a long conversation, which the reader, who is not too curious, will thank me for not inserting at length. It shall suffice, therefore, to inform him, that Lady Bellaston grew more and more pacified, and at length believed, or affected to believe, his protestations, that his meeting with Sophia that evening was merely accidental, and every other matter which the reader already knows, and which, as Jones set before her in the strongest light, it is plain that she had in reality no reason to be angry with him.
She was not, however, in her heart perfectly satisfied with his refusal to show her the letter; so deaf are we to the clearest reason, when it argues against our prevailing passions. She was, indeed, well convinced that Sophia possessed the first place in Jones's affections; and yet, haughty and amorous as this lady was, she submitted at last to bear the second place; or, to express it more properly in a legal phrase, was contented with the possession of that of which another woman had the reversion.
It was at length agreed that Jones should for the future visit at the house: for that Sophia, her maid, and all the servants, would place these
673
visits to the account of Sophia; and that she herself would be considered as the person imposed upon.
This scheme was contrived by the lady, and highly relished by Jones, who was indeed glad to have a prospect of seeing his Sophia at any rate; and the lady herself was not a little pleased with the imposition on Sophia, which Jones, she thought, could not possibly discover to her for his own sake.
The next day was appointed for the first visit, and then, after proper ceremonials, the Lady Bellaston returned home.

Chapter U
Containing various matters.
Jones was no sooner alone than he eagerly broke open his letter, and read as follows:一
"Sir, it is impossible to express what I have suffered since you left this house; and as I have reason to think you intend coming here again, I have sent Honour, though so late at night, as she tells me she knows your lodgings, to prevent you. I charge you, by all the regard you have for me, not to think of visiting here; for it will certainly be discovered; nay, I almost doubt, from some things which have dropt from her ladyship, that she is not already without some suspicion. Something favourable perhaps may happen; we must wait with patience; but I once more entreat you, if you have any concern for my ease, do not think of returning hither."
This letter administered the same kind of consolation to poor Jones, which Job formerly received from his friends. Besides disappointing all the hopes which he promised to himself from seeing Sophia, he was reduced to an unhappy dilemma, with regard to Lady Bellaston; for there are some certain engagements, which, as he well knew, do very difficultly admit of any excuse for the failure; and to go, after the strict prohibition from Sophia, he was not to be forced by any human power. At length, after much deliberation, which during that night supplied the place of sleep, he determined to feign himself sick: for this suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed visit, without incensing Lady Bellaston, which he had more than one reason of desiring to avoid.
The first thing, however, which he did in the morning, was, to write an answer to Sophia, which he inclosed in one to Honour. He then despatched another to Lady Bellaston, containing the above-mentioned excuse; and to this he soon received the following answer:一
"I am vexed that I cannot see you here this afternoon, but more concerned for the occasion; take great care of yourself, and have the best
675
advice, and I hope there will be no danger.一I am so tormented all this morning with fools, that I have scarce a moment's time to write to you. Adieu.
"P.S.一I will endeavour to call on you this evening, at nine.一Be sure to be alone."
Mr Jones now received a visit from Mrs Miller, who, after some formal introduction, began the following speech:—"I am very sorry, sir, to wait upon you on such an occasion; but I hope you will consider the ill consequence which it must be to the reputation of my poor girls, if my house should once be talked of as a house of ill-fame. I hope you won't think me, therefore, guilty of impertinence, if I beg you not to bring any more ladies in at that time of night. The clock had struck two before one of them went away."一"I do assure you, madam," said Jones, "the lady who was here last night, and who staid the latest (for the other only brought me a letter), is a woman of very great fashion, and my near relation."一"I don't know what fashion she is of," answered Mrs Miller; "but I am sure no woman of virtue, unless a very near relation indeed, would visit a young gentleman at ten at night, and stay four hours in his room with him alone; besides, sir, the behaviour of her chairmen shows what she was; for they did nothing but make jests all the evening in the entry, and asked Mr Partridge, in the hearing of my own maid, if madam intended to stay with his master all night; with a great deal of stuff not proper to be repeated. I have really a great respect for you, Mr Jones, upon your own account; nay, I have a very high obligation to you for your generosity to my cousin. Indeed, I did not know how very good you had been till lately. Little did I imagine to what dreadful courses the poor man's distress had driven him. Little did I think, when you gave me the ten guineas, that you had given them to a highwayman! O heavens! what goodness have you shown! How have you preserved this family!一The character which Mr Allworthy hath formerly given me of you was, I find, strictly true.一And indeed, if I had no obligation to you, my obligations to him are such, that, on his account, I should shew you the utmost respect in my power.一Nay, believe me, dear Mr Jones, if my daughters' and my own reputation were out of the case, I should, for your own sake, be sorry that so pretty a young gentleman should converse with these women; but if you are resolved to do it, I must beg you to take another lodging; for I do not myself like to have such things carried on under my roof; but more especially upon the account of my girls, who have little, heaven knows, besides their characters, to recommend them." Jones started and changed colour at the name of Allworthy. "Indeed, Mrs
676
Miller," answered he, a little warmly, "I do not take this at all kind. I will never bring any slander on your house; but I must insist on seeing what company I please in my own room; and if that gives you any offence, I shall, as soon as I am able, look for another lodging."一"I am sorry we must part then, sir," said she; "but I am convinced Mr Allworthy himself would never come within my doors, if he had the least suspicion of my keeping an ill house."一"Very well, madam," said Jones.一"I hope, sir," said she, "you are not angry; for I would not for the world offend any of Mr Allworthy's family. I have not slept a wink all night about this matter."一"I am sorry I have disturbed your rest, madam," said Jones, "but I beg you will send Partridge up to me immediately;" which she promised to do, and then with a very low courtesy retired.
As soon as Partridge arrived, Jones fell upon him in the most outrageous manner. "How often," said he, "am I to suffer for your folly, or rather for my own in keeping you? is that tongue of yours resolved upon my destruction?" "What have I done, sir?" answered affrighted Partridge. "Who was it gave you authority to mention the story of the robbery, or that the man you saw here was the person?" "I, sir?" cries Partridge. "Now don't be guilty of a falsehood in denying it," said Jones. "If I did mention such a matter," answers Partridge, "I am sure I thought no harm; for I should not have opened my lips, if it had not been to his own friends and relations, who, I imagined, would have let it go no farther." "But I have a much heavier charge against you," cries Jones, "than this. How durst you, after all the precautions I gave you, mention the name of Mr Allworthy in this house?" Partridge denied that he ever had, with many oaths. "How else," said Jones, "should Mrs Miller be acquainted that there was any connexion between him and me? And it is but this moment she told me she respected me on his account." "O Lord, sir," said Partridge, "I desire only to be heard out; and to be sure, never was anything so unfortunate: hear me but out, and you will own how wrongfully you have accused me. When Mrs Honour came downstairs last night she met me in the entry, and asked me when my master had heard from Mr Allworthy; and to be sure Mrs Miller heard the very words; and the moment Madam Honour was gone, she called me into the parlour to her. 'Mr Partridge,' says she, 'what Mr Allworthy is it that the gentlewoman mentioned? is it the great Mr Allworthy of Somersetshire?' 'Upon my word, madam,' says I, 'I know nothing of the matter.' 'Sure,' says she, 'your master is not the Mr Jones I have heard Mr Allworthy talk of?' 'Upon my word, madam,' says I, 'I know nothing of the matter.' 'Then,' says she, turning to her daughter Nancy, says she, 'as sure as tenpence this is
677
the very young gentleman, and he agrees exactly with the squire's description.' The Lord above knows who it was told her: for I am the ar-rantest villain that ever walked upon two legs if ever it came out of my mouth. I promise you, sir, I can keep a secret when I am desired. Nay, sir, so far was I from telling her anything about Mr Allworthy, that I told her the very direct contrary; for, though I did not contradict it at that moment, yet, as second thoughts, they say, are best, so when I came to consider that somebody must have informed her, thinks I to myself, I will put an end to the story; and so I went back again into the parlour some time afterwards, and says I, upon my word, says I, whoever, says I, told you that this gentleman was Mr Jones; that is, says I, that this Mr Jones was that Mr Jones, told you a confounded lie: and I beg, says I, you will never mention any such matter, says I; for my master, says I, will think I must have told you so; and I defy anybody in the house ever to say I mentioned any such word. To be certain, sir, it is a wonderful thing, and I have been thinking with myself ever since, how it was she came to know it; not but I saw an old woman here t'other day a begging at the door, who looked as like her we saw in Warwickshire, that caused all that mischief to us. To be sure it is never good to pass by an old woman without giving her something, especially if she looks at you; for all the world shall never persuade me but that they have a great power to do mischief, and to be sure I shall never see an old woman again, but I shall think to myself, Infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem.''
The simplicity of Partridge set Jones a laughing, and put a final end to his anger, which had indeed seldom any long duration in his mind; and, instead of commenting on his defence, he told him he intended presently to leave those lodgings, and ordered him to go and endeavour to get him others.
678
Which we hope will be very attentively perused by young people of both sexes.
Partridge had no sooner left Mr Jones than Mr Nightingale, with whom he had now contracted a great intimacy, came to him, and, after a short salutation, said, "So, Tom, I hear you had company very late last night. Upon my soul you are a happy fellow, who have not been in town above a fortnight, and can keep chairs waiting at your door till two in the morning." He then ran on with much commonplace raillery of the same kind, till Jones at last interrupted him, saying, "I suppose you have received all this information from Mrs Miller, who hath been up here a little while ago to give me warning. The good woman is afraid, it seems, of the reputation of her daughters." "Oh! she is wonderfully nice," says Nightingale, "upon that account; if you remember, she would not let Nancy go with us to the masquerade." "Nay, upon my honour, I think she's in the right of it," says Jones: "however, I have taken her at her word, and have sent Partridge to look for another lodging." "If you will," says Nightingale, "we may, I believe, be again together; for, to tell you a secret, which I desire you won't mention in the family, I intend to quit the house to-day." "What, hath Mrs Miller given you warning too, my friend?" cries Jones. "No," answered the other; "but the rooms are not convenient enough. Besides, I am grown weary of this part of the town. I want to be nearer the places of diversion; so I am going to Pall-mall." "And do you intend to make a secret of your going away?" said Jones. "I promise you," answered Nightingale, "I don't intend to bilk my lodgings; but I have a private reason for not taking a formal leave." "Not so private," answered Jones; "I promise you, I have seen it ever since the second day of my coming to the house. Here will be some wet eyes on your departure. Poor Nancy, I pity her, faith! Indeed, Jack, you have played the fool with that girl. You have given her a longing, which I am afraid nothing will ever cure her of." Nightingale answered, "What the devil would you have me do? would you have me marry her to cure
679
her?" "No," answered Jones, "I would not have had you make love to her, as you have often done in my presence. I have been astonished at the blindness of her mother in never seeing it." "Pugh, see it!" cries Nightingale. "What, the devil should she see?" "Why, see," said Jones, "that you have made her daughter distractedly in love with you. The poor girl cannot conceal it a moment; her eyes are never off from you, and she always colours every time you come into the room. Indeed, I pity her heartily; for she seems to be one of the best-natured and honestest of human creatures." "And so," answered Nightingale, "according to your doctrine, one must not amuse oneself by any common gallantries with women, for fear they should fall in love with us." "Indeed, Jack," said Jones, "you wilfully misunderstand me; I do not fancy women are so apt to fall in love; but you have gone far beyond common gallantries." "What, do you suppose," says Nightingale, "that we have been a-bed together?" "No, upon my honour," answered Jones, very seriously, "I do not suppose so ill of you; nay, I will go farther, I do not imagine you have laid a regular premeditated scheme for the destruction of the quiet of a poor little creature, or have even foreseen the consequence: for I am sure thou art a very good-natured fellow; and such a one can never be guilty of a cruelty of that kind; but at the same time you have pleased your own vanity, without considering that this poor girl was made a sacrifice to it; and while you have had no design but of amusing an idle hour, you have actually given her reason to flatter herself that you had the most serious designs in her favour. Prithee, Jack, answer me honestly; to what have tended all those elegant and luscious descriptions of happiness arising from violent and mutual fondness? all those warm professions of tenderness, and generous disinterested love? Did you imagine she would not apply them? or, speak ingenuously, did not you intend she should?" "Upon my soul, Tom," cries Nightingale, "I did not think this was in thee. Thou wilt make an admirable parson. So I suppose you would not go to bed to Nancy now, if she would let you?" "No," cries Jones, "may I be d一n'd if I would." "Tom, Tom," answered Nightingale, "last night; remember last night----
When every eye was closed, and the pale moon, And silent stars, shone conscious of the theft."
"Lookee, Mr Nightingale," said Jones, "I am no canting hypocrite, nor do I pretend to the gift of chastity, more than my neighbours. I have been guilty with women, I own it; but am not conscious that I have ever injured any.一Nor would I, to procure pleasure to myself, be knowingly the cause of misery to any human being."
680
"Well, well," said Nightingale, "I believe you, and I am convinced you acquit me of any such thing."
"I do, from my heart," answered Jones, "of having debauched the girl, but not from having gained her affections."
"If I have," said Nightingale, "I am sorry for it; but time and absence will soon wear off such impressions. It is a receipt I must take myself; for, to confess the truth to you一I never liked any girl half so much in my whole life; but I must let you into the whole secret, Tom. My father hath provided a match for me with a woman I never saw; and she is now coming to town, in order for me to make my addresses to her."
At these words Jones burst into a loud fit of laughter; when Nightingale cried—"Nay, prithee, don't turn me into ridicule. The devil take me if I am not half mad about this matter! my poor Nancy! Oh! Jones, Jones, I wish I had a fortune in my own possession."
"I heartily wish you had," cries Jones; "for, if this be the case, I sincerely pity you both; but surely you don't intend to go away without taking your leave of her?"
"I would not," answered Nightingale, "undergo the pain of taking leave, for ten thousand pounds; besides, I am convinced, instead of answering any good purpose, it would only serve to inflame my poor Nancy the more. I beg, therefore, you would not mention a word of it today, and in the evening, or to-morrow morning, I intend to depart."
Jones promised he would not; and said, upon reflection, he thought, as he had determined and was obliged to leave her, he took the most prudent method. He then told Nightingale he should be very glad to lodge in the same house with him; and it was accordingly agreed between them, that Nightingale should procure him either the ground floor, or the two pair of stairs; for the young gentleman himself was to occupy that which was between them.
This Nightingale, of whom we shall be presently obliged to say a little more, was in the ordinary transactions of life a man of strict honour, and, what is more rare among young gentlemen of the town, one of strict honesty too; yet in affairs of love he was somewhat loose in his morals; not that he was even here as void of principle as gentlemen sometimes are, and oftener affect to be; but it is certain he had been guilty of some indefensible treachery to women, and had, in a certain mystery, called making love, practised many deceits, which, if he had used in trade, he would have been counted the greatest villain upon earth.
681
But as the world, I know not well for what reason, agree to see this treachery in a better light, he was so far from being ashamed of his iniquities of this kind, that he gloried in them, and would often boast of his skill in gaining of women, and his triumphs over their hearts, for which he had before this time received some rebukes from Jones, who always exprest great bitterness against any misbehaviour to the fair part of the species, who, if considered, he said, as they ought to be, in the light of the dearest friends, were to be cultivated, honoured, and caressed with the utmost love and tenderness; but, if regarded as enemies, were a conquest of which a man ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it.

Chapter U
A short account of the history of Mrs Miller.
Jones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man, that is to say, the larger half of a shoulder of mutton. In the afternoon he received an invitation from Mrs Miller to drink tea; for that good woman, having learnt, either by means of Partridge, or by some other means natural or supernatural, that he had a connexion with Mr Allworthy, could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an angry manner.
Jones accepted the invitation; and no sooner was the tea-kettle removed, and the girls sent out of the room, than the widow, without much preface, began as follows: "Well, there are very surprizing things happen in this world; but certainly it is a wonderful business that I should have a relation of Mr Allworthy in my house, and never know anything of the matter. Alas! sir, you little imagine what a friend that best of gentlemen hath been to me and mine. Yes, sir, I am not ashamed to own it; it is owing to his goodness that I did not long since perish for want, and leave my poor little wretches, two destitute, helpless, friendless orphans, to the care, or rather to the cruelty, of the world.
"You must know, sir, though I am now reduced to get my living by letting lodgings, I was born and bred a gentlewoman. My father was an officer of the army, and died in a considerable rank: but he lived up to his pay; and, as that expired with him, his family, at his death, became beggars. We were three sisters. One of us had the good luck to die soon after of the small-pox; a lady was so kind as to take the second out of charity, as she said, to wait upon her. The mother of this lady had been a servant to my grand-mother; and, having inherited a vast fortune from her father, which he had got by pawnbroking, was married to a gentleman of great estate and fashion. She used my sister so barbarously, often upbraiding her with her birth and poverty, calling her in derision a gentlewoman, that I believe she at length broke the heart of the poor girl. In short, she likewise died within a twelvemonth after my father. Fortune thought proper to provide better for me, and within a month from his
683
decease I was married to a clergyman, who had been my lover a long time before, and who had been very ill used by my father on that account: for though my poor father could not give any of us a shilling, yet he bred us up as delicately, considered us, and would have had us consider ourselves, as highly as if we had been the richest heiresses. But my dear husband forgot all this usage, and the moment we were become fatherless he immediately renewed his addresses to me so warmly, that I, who always liked, and now more than ever esteemed him, soon complied. Five years did I live in a state of perfect happiness with that best of men, till at last一Oh! cruel! cruel fortune, that ever separated us, that deprived me of the kindest of husbands and my poor girls of the tenderest parent.一O my poor girls! you never knew the blessing which ye lost.一I am ashamed, Mr Jones, of this womanish weakness; but I shall never mention him without tears." "I ought rather, madam," said Jones, "to be ashamed that I do not accompany you." "Well, sir," continued she, "I was now left a second time in a much worse condition than before; besides the terrible affliction I was to encounter, I had now two children to provide for; and was, if possible, more pennyless than ever; when that great, that good, that glorious man, Mr Allworthy, who had some little acquaintance with my husband, accidentally heard of my distress, and immediately writ this letter to me. Here, sir, here it is; I put it into my pocket to shew it you. This is the letter, sir; I must and will read it to you.
"'Madam,
"'I heartily condole with you on your late grievous loss, which your own good sense, and the excellent lessons you must have learnt from the worthiest of men, will better enable you to bear than any advice which I am capable of giving. Nor have I any doubt that you, whom I have heard to be the tenderest of mothers, will suffer any immoderate indulgence of grief to prevent you from discharging your duty to those poor infants, who now alone stand in need of your tenderness.
"'However, as you must be supposed at present to be incapable of much worldly consideration, you will pardon my having ordered a person to wait on you, and to pay you twenty guineas, which I beg you will accept till I have the pleasure of seeing you, and believe me to be, madam, &amp;c.'
"This letter, sir, I received within a fortnight after the irreparable loss I have mentioned; and within a fortnight afterwards, Mr Allworthy一the blessed Mr Allworthy, came to pay me a visit, when he placed me in the house where you now see me, gave me a large sum of money to furnish
684
it, and settled an annuity of £50 a-year upon me, which I have constantly received ever since. Judge, then, Mr Jones, in what regard I must hold a benefactor, to whom I owe the preservation of my life, and of those dear children, for whose sake alone my life is valuable. Do not, therefore, think me impertinent, Mr Jones (since I must esteem one for whom I know Mr Allworthy hath so much value), if I beg you not to converse with these wicked women. You are a young gentleman, and do not know half their artful wiles. Do not be angry with me, sir, for what I said upon account of my house; you must be sensible it would be the ruin of my poor dear girls. Besides, sir, you cannot but be acquainted that Mr Allworthy himself would never forgive my conniving at such matters, and particularly with you."
"Upon my word, madam," said Jones, "you need make no farther apology; nor do I in the least take anything ill you have said; but give me leave, as no one can have more value than myself for Mr Allworthy, to deliver you from one mistake, which, perhaps, would not be altogether for his honour; I do assure you, I am no relation of his."
"Alas! sir," answered she, "I know you are not, I know very well who you are; for Mr Allworthy hath told me all; but I do assure you, had you been twenty times his son, he could not have expressed more regard for you than he hath often expressed in my presence. You need not be ashamed, sir, of what you are; I promise you no good person will esteem you the less on that account. No, Mr Jones, the words 'dishonourable birth' are nonsense, as my dear, dear husband used to say, unless the word 'dishonourable' be applied to the parents; for the children can derive no real dishonour from an act of which they are intirely innocent."
Here Jones heaved a deep sigh, and then said, "Since I perceive, madam, you really do know me, and Mr Allworthy hath thought proper to mention my name to you; and since you have been so explicit with me as to your own affairs, I will acquaint you with some more circumstances concerning myself." And these Mrs Miller having expressed great desire and curiosity to hear, he began and related to her his whole history, without once mentioning the name of Sophia.
There is a kind of sympathy in honest minds, by means of which they give an easy credit to each other. Mrs Miller believed all which Jones told her to be true, and exprest much pity and concern for him. She was beginning to comment on the story, but Jones interrupted her; for, as the hour of assignation now drew nigh, he began to stipulate for a second interview with the lady that evening, which he promised should be the last
685
at her house; swearing, at the same time, that she was one of great distinction, and that nothing but what was intirely innocent was to pass between them; and I do firmly believe he intended to keep his word.
Mrs Miller was at length prevailed on, and Jones departed to his chamber, where he sat alone till twelve o'clock, but no Lady Bellaston appeared.
As we have said that this lady had a great affection for Jones, and as it must have appeared that she really had so, the reader may perhaps wonder at the first failure of her appointment, as she apprehended him to be confined by sickness, a season when friendship seems most to require such visits. This behaviour, therefore, in the lady, may, by some, be condemned as unnatural; but that is not our fault; for our business is only to record truth.

Containing a scene which we doubt not will affect all our readers.
Mr Jones closed not his eyes during all the former part of the night; not owing to any uneasiness which he conceived at being disappointed by Lady Bellaston; nor was Sophia herself, though most of his waking hours were justly to be charged to her account, the present cause of dispelling his slumbers. In fact, poor Jones was one of the best-natured fellows alive, and had all that weakness which is called compassion, and which distinguishes this imperfect character from that noble firmness of mind, which rolls a man, as it were, within himself, and like a polished bowl, enables him to run through the world without being once stopped by the calamities which happen to others. He could not help, therefore, compassionating the situation of poor Nancy, whose love for Mr Nightingale seemed to him so apparent, that he was astonished at the blindness of her mother, who had more than once, the preceding evening, remarked to him the great change in the temper of her daughter, "who from being," she said, "one of the liveliest, merriest girls in the world, was, on a sudden, become all gloom and melancholy."
Sleep, however, at length got the better of all resistance; and now, as if he had already been a deity, as the antients imagined, and an offended one too, he seemed to enjoy his dear-bought conquest.一To speak simply, and without any metaphor, Mr Jones slept till eleven the next morning, and would, perhaps, have continued in the same quiet situation much longer, had not a violent uproar awakened him.
Partridge was now summoned, who, being asked what was the matter, answered, "That there was a dreadful hurricane below-stairs; that Miss Nancy was in fits; and that the other sister, and the mother, were both crying and lamenting over her." Jones expressed much concern at this news; which Partridge endeavoured to relieve, by saying, with a smile, "he fancied the young lady was in no danger of death; for that Susan" (which was the name of the maid) "had given him to understand, it was nothing more than a common affair. In short," said he, "Miss
687
Nancy hath had a mind to be as wise as her mother; that's all; she was a little hungry, it seems, and so sat down to dinner before grace was said; and so there is a child coming for the Foundling Hospital."-"Prithee,
leave thy stupid jesting," cries Jones. "Is the misery of these poor wretches a subject of mirth? Go immediately to Mrs Miller, and tell her I beg leave—Stay, you will make some blunder; I will go myself; for she desired me to breakfast with her." He then rose and dressed himself as fast as he could; and while he was dressing, Partridge, notwithstanding many severe rebukes, could not avoid throwing forth certain pieces of brutality, commonly called jests, on this occasion. Jones was no sooner dressed than he walked downstairs, and knocking at the door, was presently admitted by the maid, into the outward parlour, which was as empty of company as it was of any apparatus for eating. Mrs Miller was in the inner room with her daughter, whence the maid presently brought a message to Mr Jones, "That her mistress hoped he would excuse the disappointment, but an accident had happened, which made it impossible for her to have the pleasure of his company at breakfast that day; and begged his pardon for not sending him up notice sooner." Jones desired, "She would give herself no trouble about anything so trifling as his disappointment; that he was heartily sorry for the occasion; and that if he could be of any service to her, she might command him."
He had scarce spoke these words, when Mrs Miller, who heard them all, suddenly threw open the door, and coming out to him, in a flood of tears, said, "O Mr Jones! you are certainly one of the best young men alive. I give you a thousand thanks for your kind offer of your service; but, alas! sir, it is out of your power to preserve my poor girl.—O my child! my child! she is undone, she is ruined for ever!" "I hope, madam," said Jones, "no villain"--"O Mr Jones!" said she, "that villain who yes-
terday left my lodgings, hath betrayed my poor girl; hath destroyed her.一I know you are a man of honour. You have a good一a noble heart, Mr Jones. The actions to which I have been myself a witness, could proceed from no other. I will tell you all: nay, indeed, it is impossible, after what hath happened, to keep it a secret. That Nightingale, that barbarous villain, hath undone my daughter. She is—she is—oh! Mr Jones, my girl is with child by him; and in that condition he hath deserted her. Here! here, sir, is his cruel letter: read it, Mr Jones, and tell me if such another monster lives."
The letter was as follows:
"DEAR NANCY,
688
"As I found it impossible to mention to you what, I am afraid, will be no less shocking to you, than it is to me, I have taken this method to inform you, that my father insists upon my immediately paying my addresses to a young lady of fortune, whom he hath provided for my一I need not write the detested word. Your own good understanding will make you sensible, how entirely I am obliged to an obedience, by which I shall be for ever excluded from your dear arms. The fondness of your mother may encourage you to trust her with the unhappy consequence of our love, which may be easily kept a secret from the world, and for which I will take care to provide, as I will for you. I wish you may feel less on this account than I have suffered; but summon all your fortitude to your assistance, and forgive and forget the man, whom nothing but the prospect of certain ruin could have forced to write this letter. I bid you forget me, I mean only as a lover; but the best of friends you shall ever find in your faithful, though unhappy,
"J. N."
When Jones had read this letter, they both stood silent during a minute, looking at each other; at last he began thus: "I cannot express, madam, how much I am shocked at what I have read; yet let me beg you, in one particular, to take the writer's advice. Consider the reputation of your daughter."----"It is gone, it is lost, Mr Jones," cryed she, "as well as
her innocence. She received the letter in a room full of company, and immediately swooning away upon opening it, the contents were known to every one present. But the loss of her reputation, bad as it is, is not the worst; I shall lose my child; she hath attempted twice to destroy herself already; and though she hath been hitherto prevented, vows she will not outlive it; nor could I myself outlive any accident of that nature.一What then will become of my little Betsy, a helpless infant orphan? and the poor little wretch will, I believe, break her heart at the miseries with which she sees her sister and myself distracted, while she is ignorant of the cause. O 'tis the most sensible, and best-natured little thing! The barbarous, cruel---hath destroyed us all. O my poor children! Is this the
reward of all my cares? Is this the fruit of all my prospects? Have I so chearfully undergone all the labours and duties of a mother? Have I been so tender of their infancy, so careful of their education? Have I been toiling so many years, denying myself even the conveniences of life, to provide some little sustenance for them, to lose one or both in such a manner?" "Indeed, madam," said Jones, with tears in his eyes, "I pity you from my soul."一"O! Mr Jones," answered she, "even you, though I know the goodness of your heart, can have no idea of what I feel. The best, the
689
kindest, the most dutiful of children! O my poor Nancy, the darling of my soul! the delight of my eyes! the pride of my heart! too much, indeed, my pride; for to those foolish, ambitious hopes, arising from her beauty, I owe her ruin. Alas! I saw with pleasure the liking which this young man had for her. I thought it an honourable affection; and flattered my foolish vanity with the thoughts of seeing her married to one so much her superior. And a thousand times in my presence, nay, often in yours, he hath endeavoured to soothe and encourage these hopes by the most generous expressions of disinterested love, which he hath always directed to my poor girl, and which I, as well as she, believed to be real. Could I have believed that these were only snares laid to betray the innocence of my child, and for the ruin of us all?"一At these words little Betsy came running into the room, crying, "Dear mamma, for heaven's sake come to my sister; for she is in another fit, and my cousin can't hold her." Mrs Miller immediately obeyed the summons; but first ordered Betsy to stay with Mr Jones, and begged him to entertain her a few minutes, saying, in the most pathetic voice, "Good heaven! let me preserve one of my children at least."
Jones, in compliance with this request, did all he could to comfort the little girl, though he was, in reality, himself very highly affected with Mrs Miller's story. He told her "Her sister would be soon very well again; that by taking on in that manner she would not only make her sister worse, but make her mother ill too." "Indeed, sir," says she, "I would not do anything to hurt them for the world. I would burst my heart rather than they should see me cry.一But my poor sister can't see me cry.一I am afraid she will never be able to see me cry any more. Indeed, I can't part with her; indeed, I can't.一And then poor mamma too, what will become of her?一She says she will die too, and leave me: but I am resolved I won't be left behind." "And are you not afraid to die, my little Betsy?" said Jones. "Yes," answered she, "I was always afraid to die; because I must have left my mamma, and my sister; but I am not afraid of going anywhere with those I love."
Jones was so pleased with this answer, that he eagerly kissed the child; and soon after Mrs Miller returned, saying, "She thanked heaven Nancy was now come to herself. And now, Betsy," says she, "you may go in, for your sister is better, and longs to see you." She then turned to Jones, and began to renew her apologies for having disappointed him of his breakfast.
"I hope, madam," said Jones, "I shall have a more exquisite repast than any you could have provided for me. This, I assure you, will be the case,
690
if I can do any service to this little family of love. But whatever success may attend my endeavours, I am resolved to attempt it. I am very much deceived in Mr Nightingale, if, notwithstanding what hath happened, he hath not much goodness of heart at the bottom, as well as a very violent affection for your daughter. If this be the case, I think the picture which I shall lay before him will affect him. Endeavour, madam, to comfort yourself, and Miss Nancy, as well as you can. I will go instantly in quest of Mr Nightingale; and I hope to bring you good news."
Mrs Miller fell upon her knees and invoked all the blessings of heaven upon Mr Jones; to which she afterwards added the most passionate expressions of gratitude. He then departed to find Mr Nightingale, and the good woman returned to comfort her daughter, who was somewhat cheared at what her mother told her; and both joined in resounding the praises of Mr Jones.

Chapter /
The interview between Mr Jones and Mr Nightingale.
The good or evil we confer on others very often, I believe, recoils on ourselves. For as men of a benign disposition enjoy their own acts of beneficence equally with those to whom they are done, so there are scarce any natures so entirely diabolical, as to be capable of doing injuries, without paying themselves some pangs for the ruin which they bring on their fellow-creatures.
Mr Nightingale, at least, was not such a person. On the contrary, Jones found him in his new lodgings, sitting melancholy by the fire, and silently lamenting the unhappy situation in which he had placed poor Nancy. He no sooner saw his friend appear than he arose hastily to meet him; and after much congratulation said, "Nothing could be more opportune than this kind visit; for I was never more in the spleen in my life."
"I am sorry," answered Jones, "that I bring news very unlikely to relieve you: nay, what I am convinced must, of all other, shock you the most. However, it is necessary you should know it. Without further preface, then, I come to you, Mr Nightingale, from a worthy family, which you have involved in misery and ruin." Mr Nightingale changed colour at these words; but Jones, without regarding it, proceeded, in the liveliest manner, to paint the tragical story with which the reader was acquainted in the last chapter.
Nightingale never once interrupted the narration, though he discovered violent emotions at many parts of it. But when it was concluded, after fetching a deep sigh, he said, "What you tell me, my friend, affects me in the tenderest manner. Sure there never was so cursed an accident as the poor girl's betraying my letter. Her reputation might otherwise have been safe, and the affair might have remained a profound secret; and then the girl might have gone off never the worse; for many such things happen in this town: and if the husband should suspect a little,
692
when it is too late, it will be his wiser conduct to conceal his suspicion both from his wife and the world."
"Indeed, my friend," answered Jones, "this could not have been the case with your poor Nancy. You have so entirely gained her affections, that it is the loss of you, and not of her reputation, which afflicts her, and will end in the destruction of her and her family." "Nay, for that matter, I promise you," cries Nightingale, "she hath my affections so absolutely, that my wife, whoever she is to be, will have very little share in them." "And is it possible then," said Jones, "you can think of deserting her?" "Why, what can I do?" answered the other. "Ask Miss Nancy," replied Jones warmly. "In the condition to which you have reduced her, I sincerely think she ought to determine what reparation you shall make her. Her interest alone, and not yours, ought to be your sole consideration. But if you ask me what you shall do, what can you do less," cries Jones, "than fulfil the expectations of her family, and her own? Nay, I sincerely tell you, they were mine too, ever since I first saw you together. You will pardon me if I presume on the friendship you have favoured me with, moved as I am with compassion for those poor creatures. But your own heart will best suggest to you, whether you have never intended, by your conduct, to persuade the mother, as well as the daughter, into an opinion, that you designed honourably: and if so, though there may have been no direct promise of marriage in the case, I will leave to your own good understanding, how far you are bound to proceed."
"Nay, I must not only confess what you have hinted," said Nightingale; "but I am afraid even that very promise you mention I have given." "And can you, after owning that," said Jones, "hesitate a moment?" "Consider, my friend," answered the other; "I know you are a man of honour, and would advise no one to act contrary to its rules; if there were no other objection, can I, after this publication of her disgrace, think of such an alliance with honour?" "Undoubtedly," replied Jones, "and the very best and truest honour, which is goodness, requires it of you. As you mention a scruple of this kind, you will give me leave to examine it. Can you with honour be guilty of having under false pretences deceived a young woman and her family, and of having by these means treacherously robbed her of her innocence? Can you, with honour, be the knowing, the wilful occasion, nay, the artful contriver of the ruin of a human being? Can you, with honour, destroy the fame, the peace, nay, probably, both the life and soul too, of this creature? Can honour bear the thought, that this creature is a tender, helpless, defenceless, young woman? A young woman, who loves, who doats on you, who dies for you; who
693
hath placed the utmost confidence in your promises; and to that confidence hath sacrificed everything which is dear to her? Can honour support such contemplations as these a moment?"
"Common sense, indeed," said Nightingale, "warrants all you say; but yet you well know the opinion of the world is so contrary to it, that, was I to marry a whore, though my own, I should be ashamed of ever showing my face again."
"Fie upon it, Mr Nightingale!" said Jones, "do not call her by so ungenerous a name: when you promised to marry her she became your wife; and she hath sinned more against prudence than virtue. And what is this world which you would be ashamed to face but the vile, the foolish, and the profligate? Forgive me if I say such a shame must proceed from false modesty, which always attends false honour as its shadow.一But I am well assured there is not a man of real sense and goodness in the world who would not honour and applaud the action. But, admit no other would, would not your own heart, my friend, applaud it? And do not the warm, rapturous sensations, which we feel from the consciousness of an honest, noble, generous, benevolent action, convey more delight to the mind than the undeserved praise of millions? Set the alternative fairly before your eyes. On the one side, see this poor, unhappy, tender, believing girl, in the arms of her wretched mother, breathing her last. Hear her breaking heart in agonies, sighing out your name; and lamenting, rather than accusing, the cruelty which weighs her down to destruction. Paint to your imagination the circumstances of her fond despairing parent, driven to madness, or, perhaps, to death, by the loss of her lovely daughter. View the poor, helpless, orphan infant; and when your mind hath dwelt a moment only on such ideas, consider yourself as the cause of all the ruin of this poor, little, worthy, defenceless family. On the other side, consider yourself as relieving them from their temporary sufferings. Think with what joy, with what transports that lovely creature will fly to your arms. See her blood returning to her pale cheeks, her fire to her languid eyes, and raptures to her tortured breast. Consider the exultations of her mother, the happiness of all. Think of this little family made by one act of yours completely happy. Think of this alternative, and sure I am mistaken in my friend if it requires any long deliberation whether he will sink these wretches down for ever, or, by one generous, noble resolution, raise them all from the brink of misery and despair to the highest pitch of human happiness. Add to this but one consideration more; the consideration that it is your duty so to do一That the misery
694
from which you will relieve these poor people is the misery which you yourself have wilfully brought upon them."
"O, my dear friend!" cries Nightingale, "I wanted not your eloquence to rouse me. I pity poor Nancy from my soul, and would willingly give anything in my power that no familiarities had ever passed between us. Nay, believe me, I had many struggles with my passion before I could prevail with myself to write that cruel letter, which hath caused all the misery in that unhappy family. If I had no inclinations to consult but my own, I would marry her to-morrow morning: I would, by heaven! but you will easily imagine how impossible it would be to prevail on my father to consent to such a match; besides, he hath provided another for me; and to-morrow, by his express command, I am to wait on the lady."
"I have not the honour to know your father," said Jones; "but, suppose he could be persuaded, would you yourself consent to the only means of preserving these poor people?" "As eagerly as I would pursue my happiness," answered Nightingale: "for I never shall find it in any other wo-man.一O, my dear friend! could you imagine what I have felt within these twelve hours for my poor girl, I am convinced she would not engross all your pity. Passion leads me only to her; and, if I had any foolish scruples of honour, you have fully satisfied them: could my father be induced to comply with my desires, nothing would be wanting to com-pleat my own happiness or that of my Nancy."
"Then I am resolved to undertake it," said Jones. "You must not be angry with me, in whatever light it may be necessary to set this affair, which, you may depend on it, could not otherwise be long hid from him: for things of this nature make a quick progress when once they get abroad, as this unhappily hath already. Besides, should any fatal accident follow, as upon my soul I am afraid will, unless immediately prevented, the public would ring of your name in a manner which, if your father hath common humanity, must offend him. If you will therefore tell me where I may find the old gentleman, I will not lose a moment in the business; which, while I pursue, you cannot do a more generous action than by paying a visit to the poor girl. You will find I have not exaggerated in the account I have given of the wretchedness of the family."
Nightingale immediately consented to the proposal; and now, having acquainted Jones with his father's lodging, and the coffee-house where he would most probably find him, he hesitated a moment, and then said, "My dear Tom, you are going to undertake an impossibility. If you knew my father you would never think of obtaining his consent.--------------Stay,
695
there is one way一suppose you told him I was already married, it might be easier to reconcile him to the fact after it was done; and, upon my honour, I am so affected with what you have said, and I love my Nancy so passionately, I almost wish it was done, whatever might be the consequence."
Jones greatly approved the hint, and promised to pursue it. They then separated, Nightingale to visit his Nancy, and Jones in quest of the old gentleman.

Chapter V?
What passed between Jones and old Mr Nightingale; with the arrival of a person not yet mentioned in this history.
Notwithstanding the sentiment of the Roman satirist, which denies the divinity of fortune, and the opinion of Seneca to the same purpose; Cicero, who was, I believe, a wiser man than either of them, expressly holds the contrary; and certain it is, there are some incidents in life so very strange and unaccountable, that it seems to require more than human skill and foresight in producing them.
Of this kind was what now happened to Jones, who found Mr Nightingale the elder in so critical a minute, that Fortune, if she was really worthy all the worship she received at Rome, could not have contrived such another. In short, the old gentleman, and the father of the young lady whom he intended for his son, had been hard at it for many hours; and the latter was just now gone, and had left the former delighted with the thoughts that he had succeeded in a long contention, which had been between the two fathers of the future bride and bridegroom; in which both endeavoured to overreach the other, and, as it not rarely happens in such cases, both had retreated fully satisfied of having obtained the victory.
This gentleman, whom Mr Jones now visited, was what they call a man of the world; that is to say, a man who directs his conduct in this world as one who, being fully persuaded there is no other, is resolved to make the most of this. In his early years he had been bred to trade; but, having acquired a very good fortune, he had lately declined his business; or, to speak more properly, had changed it from dealing in goods, to dealing only in money, of which he had always a plentiful fund at command, and of which he knew very well how to make a very plentiful advantage, sometimes of the necessities of private men, and sometimes of those of the public. He had indeed conversed so entirely with money, that it may be almost doubted whether he imagined there was any other
697
thing really existing in the world; this at least may be certainly averred, that he firmly believed nothing else to have any real value.
The reader will, I fancy, allow that Fortune could not have culled out a more improper person for Mr Jones to attack with any probability of success; nor could the whimsical lady have directed this attack at a more unseasonable time.
As money then was always uppermost in this gentleman's thoughts, so the moment he saw a stranger within his doors it immediately occurred to his imagination, that such stranger was either come to bring him money, or to fetch it from him. And according as one or other of these thoughts prevailed, he conceived a favourable or unfavourable idea of the person who approached him.
Unluckily for Jones, the latter of these was the ascendant at present; for as a young gentleman had visited him the day before, with a bill from his son for a play debt, he apprehended, at the first sight of Jones, that he was come on such another errand. Jones therefore had no sooner told him that he was come on his son's account than the old gentleman, being confirmed in his suspicion, burst forth into an exclamation, "That he would lose his labour." "Is it then possible, sir," answered Jones, "that you can guess my business?" "If I do guess it," replied the other, "I repeat again to you, you will lose your labour. What, I suppose you are one of those sparks who lead my son into all those scenes of riot and debauchery, which will be his destruction? but I shall pay no more of his bills, I promise you. I expect he will quit all such company for the future. If I had imagined otherwise, I should not have provided a wife for him; for I would be instrumental in the ruin of nobody." "How, sir," said Jones, "and was this lady of your providing?" "Pray, sir," answered the old gentleman, "how comes it to be any concern of yours?"一"Nay, dear sir," replied Jones, "be not offended that I interest myself in what regards your son's happiness, for whom I have so great an honour and value. It was upon that very account I came to wait upon you. I can't express the satisfaction you have given me by what you say; for I do assure you your son is a person for whom I have the highest honour.一Nay, sir, it is not easy to express the esteem I have for you; who could be so generous, so good, so kind, so indulgent to provide such a match for your son; a woman, who, I dare swear, will make him one of the happiest men upon earth."
There is scarce anything which so happily introduces men to our good liking, as having conceived some alarm at their first appearance; when
698
once those apprehensions begin to vanish we soon forget the fears which they occasioned, and look on ourselves as indebted for our present ease to those very persons who at first raised our fears.
Thus it happened to Nightingale, who no sooner found that Jones had no demand on him, as he suspected, than he began to be pleased with his presence. "Pray, good sir," said he, "be pleased to sit down. I do not remember to have ever had the pleasure of seeing you before; but if you are a friend of my son, and have anything to say concerning this young lady, I shall be glad to hear you. As to her making him happy, it will be his own fault if she doth not. I have discharged my duty, in taking care of the main article. She will bring him a fortune capable of making any reasonable, prudent, sober man, happy." "Undoubtedly," cries Jones, "for she is in herself a fortune; so beautiful, so genteel, so sweet-tempered, and so well-educated; she is indeed a most accomplished young lady; sings admirably well, and hath a most delicate hand at the harpsichord." "I did not know any of these matters," answered the old gentleman, "for I never saw the lady: but I do not like her the worse for what you tell me; and I am the better pleased with her father for not laying any stress on these qualifications in our bargain. I shall always think it a proof of his understanding. A silly fellow would have brought in these articles as an addition to her fortune; but, to give him his due, he never mentioned any such matter; though to be sure they are no disparagements to a woman." "I do assure you, sir," cries Jones, "she hath them all in the most eminent degree: for my part, I own I was afraid you might have been a little backward, a little less inclined to the match; for your son told me you had never seen the lady; therefore I came, sir, in that case, to entreat you, to conjure you, as you value the happiness of your son, not to be averse to his match with a woman who hath not only all the good qualities I have mentioned, but many more."一"If that was your business, sir," said the old gentleman, "we are both obliged to you; and you may be perfectly easy; for I give you my word I was very well satisfied with her fortune." "Sir," answered Jones, "I honour you every moment more and more. To be so easily satisfied, so very moderate on that account, is a proof of the soundness of your understanding, as well as the nobleness of your mind."-----"Not so very moderate, young gentleman, not so very moder-
ate," answered the father.一"Still more and more noble," replied Jones; "and give me leave to add, sensible: for sure it is little less than madness to consider money as the sole foundation of happiness. Such a woman as this with her little, her nothing of a fortune"一"I find," cries the old gentleman, "you have a pretty just opinion of money, my friend, or else you
699
are better acquainted with the person of the lady than with her circumstances. Why, pray, what fortune do you imagine this lady to have?" "What fortune?" cries Jones, "why, too contemptible a one to be named for your son."一"Well, well, well," said the other, "perhaps he might have done better."一"That I deny," said Jones, "for she is one of the best of women."一"Ay, ay, but in point of fortune I mean," answered the other. "And yet, as to that now, how much do you imagine your friend is to have?"一"How much?" cries Jones, "how much? Why, at the utmost, perhaps £200." "Do you mean to banter me, young gentleman?" said the father, a little angry. "No, upon my soul," answered Jones, "I am in earnest: nay, I believe I have gone to the utmost farthing. If I do the lady an injury, I ask her pardon." "Indeed you do," cries the father; "I am certain she hath fifty times that sum, and she shall produce fifty to that before I consent that she shall marry my son." "Nay," said Jones, "it is too late to talk of consent now; if she had not fifty farthings your son is mar-ried."—"My son married!" answered the old gentleman, with surprize. "Nay," said Jones, "I thought you was unacquainted with it." "My son married to Miss Harris!" answered he again. "To Miss Harris!" said Jones; "no, sir; to Miss Nancy Miller, the daughter of Mrs Miller, at whose house he lodged; a young lady, who, though her mother is reduced to let lodgings一"一"Are you bantering, or are you in earnest?" cries the father, with a most solemn voice. "Indeed, sir," answered Jones, "I scorn the character of a banterer. I came to you in most serious earnest, imagining, as I find true, that your son had never dared acquaint you with a match so much inferior to him in point of fortune, though the reputation of the lady will suffer it no longer to remain a secret."
While the father stood like one struck suddenly dumb at this news, a gentleman came into the room, and saluted him by the name of brother.
But though these two were in consanguinity so nearly related, they were in their dispositions almost the opposites to each other. The brother who now arrived had likewise been bred to trade, in which he no sooner saw himself worth £6000 than he purchased a small estate with the greatest part of it, and retired into the country; where he married the daughter of an unbeneficed clergyman; a young lady, who, though she had neither beauty nor fortune, had recommended herself to his choice entirely by her good humour, of which she possessed a very large share.
With this woman he had, during twenty-five years, lived a life more resembling the model which certain poets ascribe to the golden age, than any of those patterns which are furnished by the present times. By her he had four children, but none of them arrived at maturity, except only one
700
daughter, whom, in vulgar language, he and his wife had spoiled; that is, had educated with the utmost tenderness and fondness, which she returned to such a degree, that she had actually refused a very extraordinary match with a gentleman a little turned of forty, because she could not bring herself to part with her parents.
The young lady whom Mr Nightingale had intended for his son was a near neighbour of his brother, and an acquaintance of his niece; and in reality it was upon the account of his projected match that he was now come to town; not, indeed, to forward, but to dissuade his brother from a purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his nephew; for he foresaw no other event from a union with Miss Harris, notwithstanding the largeness of her fortune, as neither her person nor mind seemed to him to promise any kind of matrimonial felicity: for she was very tall, very thin, very ugly, very affected, very silly, and very ill-natured.
His brother, therefore, no sooner mentioned the marriage of his nephew with Miss Miller, than he exprest the utmost satisfaction; and when the father had very bitterly reviled his son, and pronounced sentence of beggary upon him, the uncle began in the following manner:
"If you was a little cooler, brother, I would ask you whether you love your son for his sake or for your own. You would answer, I suppose, and so I suppose you think, for his sake; and doubtless it is his happiness which you intended in the marriage you proposed for him.
"Now, brother, to prescribe rules of happiness to others hath always appeared to me very absurd, and to insist on doing this, very tyrannical. It is a vulgar error, I know; but it is, nevertheless, an error. And if this be absurd in other things, it is mostly so in the affair of marriage, the happiness of which depends entirely on the affection which subsists between the parties.
"I have therefore always thought it unreasonable in parents to desire to chuse for their children on this occasion; since to force affection is an impossible attempt; nay, so much doth love abhor force, that I know not whether, through an unfortunate but uncurable perverseness in our natures, it may not be even impatient of persuasion.
"It is, however, true that, though a parent will not, I think, wisely prescribe, he ought to be consulted on this occasion; and, in strictness, perhaps, should at least have a negative voice. My nephew, therefore, I own, in marrying, without asking your advice, hath been guilty of a fault. But, honestly speaking, brother, have you not a little promoted this fault? Have not your frequent declarations on this subject given him a moral
701
certainty of your refusal, where there was any deficiency in point of fortune? Nay, doth not your present anger arise solely from that deficiency? And if he hath failed in his duty here, did you not as much exceed that authority when you absolutely bargained with him for a woman, without his knowledge, whom you yourself never saw, and whom, if you had seen and known as well as I, it must have been madness in you to have ever thought of bringing her into your family?
"Still I own my nephew in a fault; but surely it is not an unpardonable fault. He hath acted indeed without your consent, in a matter in which he ought to have asked it, but it is in a matter in which his interest is principally concerned; you yourself must and will acknowledge that you consulted his interest only, and if he unfortunately differed from you, and hath been mistaken in his notion of happiness, will you, brother, if you love your son, carry him still wider from the point? Will you increase the ill consequences of his simple choice? Will you endeavour to make an event certain misery to him, which may accidentally prove so? In a word, brother, because he hath put it out of your power to make his circumstances as affluent as you would, will you distress them as much as you can?"
By the force of the true Catholic faith St Anthony won upon the fishes. Orpheus and Amphion went a little farther, and by the charms of music enchanted things merely inanimate. Wonderful, both! but neither history nor fable have ever yet ventured to record an instance of any one, who, by force of argument and reason, hath triumphed over habitual avarice.
Mr Nightingale, the father, instead of attempting to answer his brother, contented himself with only observing, that they had always differed in their sentiments concerning the education of their children. "I wish," said he, "brother, you would have confined your care to your own daughter, and never have troubled yourself with my son, who hath, I believe, as little profited by your precepts, as by your example." For young Nightingale was his uncle's godson, and had lived more with him than with his father. So that the uncle had often declared he loved his nephew almost equally with his own child.
Jones fell into raptures with this good gentleman; and when, after much persuasion, they found the father grew still more and more irritated, instead of appeased, Jones conducted the uncle to his nephew at the house of Mrs Miller.

Chapter J
Containing strange matters.
At his return to his lodgings, Jones found the situation of affairs greatly altered from what they had been in at his departure. The mother, the two daughters, and young Mr Nightingale, were now sat down to supper together, when the uncle was, at his own desire, introduced without any ceremony into the company, to all of whom he was well known; for he had several times visited his nephew at that house.
The old gentleman immediately walked up to Miss Nancy, saluted and wished her joy, as he did afterwards the mother and the other sister; and lastly, he paid the proper compliments to his nephew, with the same good humour and courtesy, as if his nephew had married his equal or superior in fortune, with all the previous requisites first performed.
Miss Nancy and her supposed husband both turned pale, and looked rather foolish than otherwise upon the occasion; but Mrs Miller took the first opportunity of withdrawing; and, having sent for Jones into the dining-room, she threw herself at his feet, and in a most passionate flood of tears, called him her good angel, the preserver of her poor little family, with many other respectful and endearing appellations, and made him every acknowledgment which the highest benefit can extract from the most grateful heart.
After the first gust of her passion was a little over, which she declared, if she had not vented, would have burst her, she proceeded to inform Mr Jones that all matters were settled between Mr Nightingale and her daughter, and that they were to be married the next morning; at which Mr Jones having expressed much pleasure, the poor woman fell again into a fit of joy and thanksgiving, which he at length with difficulty silenced, and prevailed on her to return with him back to the company, whom they found in the same good humour in which they had left them.
This little society now past two or three very agreeable hours together, in which the uncle, who was a very great lover of his bottle, had so well
703
plyed his nephew, that this latter, though not drunk, began to be somewhat flustered; and now Mr Nightingale, taking the old gentleman with him upstairs into the apartment he had lately occupied, unbosomed himself as follows:一
"As you have been always the best and kindest of uncles to me, and as you have shown such unparalleled goodness in forgiving this match, which to be sure may be thought a little improvident, I should never forgive myself if I attempted to deceive you in anything." He then confessed the truth, and opened the whole affair.
"How, Jack?" said the old gentleman, "and are you really then not married to this young woman?" "No, upon my honour," answered Nightingale, "I have told you the simple truth." "My dear boy," cries the uncle, kissing him, "I am heartily glad to hear it. I never was better pleased in my life. If you had been married I should have assisted you as much as was in my power to have made the best of a bad matter; but there is a great difference between considering a thing which is already done and irrecoverable, and that which is yet to do. Let your reason have fair play, Jack, and you will see this match in so foolish and preposterous a light, that there will be no need of any dissuasive arguments." "How, sir?" replies young Nightingale, "is there this difference between having already done an act, and being in honour engaged to do it?" "Pugh!" said the uncle, "honour is a creature of the world's making, and the world hath the power of a creator over it, and may govern and direct it as they please. Now you well know how trivial these breaches of contract are thought; even the grossest make but the wonder and conversation of a day. Is there a man who afterwards will be more backward in giving you his sister, or daughter? or is there any sister or daughter who would be more backward to receive you? Honour is not concerned in these engagements." "Pardon me, dear sir," cries Nightingale, "I can never think so; and not only honour, but conscience and humanity, are concerned. I am well satisfied, that, was I now to disappoint the young creature, her death would be the consequence, and I should look upon myself as her murderer; nay, as her murderer by the cruellest of all methods, by breaking her heart." "Break her heart, indeed! no, no, Jack," cries the uncle, "the hearts of women are not so soon broke; they are tough, boy, they are tough." "But, sir," answered Nightingale, "my own affections are engaged, and I never could be happy with any other woman. How often have I heard you say, that children should be always suffered to chuse for themselves, and that you would let my cousin Harriet do so?" "Why, ay," replied the old gentleman, "so I would have them; but then I would
704
have them chuse wisely.一Indeed, Jack, you must and shall leave the girl."---"Indeed, uncle," cries the other, "I must and will have her." "You
will, young gentleman;" said the uncle; "I did not expect such a word from you. I should not wonder if you had used such language to your father, who hath always treated you like a dog, and kept you at the distance which a tyrant preserves over his subjects; but I, who have lived with you upon an equal footing, might surely expect better usage: but I know how to account for it all: it is all owing to your preposterous education, in which I have had too little share. There is my daughter, now, whom I have brought up as my friend, never doth anything without my advice, nor ever refuses to take it when I give it her." "You have never yet given her advice in an affair of this kind," said Nightingale; "for I am greatly mistaken in my cousin, if she would be very ready to obey even your most positive commands in abandoning her inclinations." "Don't abuse my girl," answered the old gentleman with some emotion; "don't abuse my Harriet. I have brought her up to have no inclinations contrary to my own. By suffering her to do whatever she pleases, I have enured her to a habit of being pleased to do whatever I like." "Pardon, me, sir," said Nightingale, "I have not the least design to reflect on my cousin, for whom I have the greatest esteem; and indeed I am convinced you will never put her to so severe a tryal, or lay such hard commands on her as you would do on me.一But, dear sir, let us return to the company; for they will begin to be uneasy at our long absence. I must beg one favour of my dear uncle, which is that he would not say anything to shock the poor girl or her mother." "Oh! you need not fear me," answered he, "I understand myself too well to affront women; so I will readily grant you that favour; and in return I must expect another of you." "There are but few of your commands, sir," said Nightingale, "which I shall not very chearfully obey." "Nay, sir, I ask nothing," said the uncle, "but the honour of your company home to my lodging, that I may reason the case a little more fully with you; for I would, if possible, have the satisfaction of preserving my family, notwithstanding the headstrong folly of my brother, who, in his own opinion, is the wisest man in the world."
Nightingale, who well knew his uncle to be as headstrong as his father, submitted to attend him home, and then they both returned back into the room, where the old gentleman promised to carry himself with the same decorum which he had before maintained.

Chapter A Vx
A short chapter, which concludes the book.
The long absence of the uncle and nephew had occasioned some disquiet in the minds of all whom they had left behind them; and the more, as, during the preceding dialogue, the uncle had more than once elevated his voice, so as to be heard downstairs; which, though they could not distinguish what he said, had caused some evil foreboding in Nancy and her mother, and, indeed, even in Jones himself.
When the good company, therefore, again assembled, there was a visible alteration in all their faces; and the good-humour which, at their last meeting, universally shone forth in every countenance, was now changed into a much less agreeable aspect. It was a change, indeed, common enough to the weather in this climate, from sunshine to clouds, from June to December.
This alteration was not, however, greatly remarked by any present; for as they were all now endeavouring to conceal their own thoughts, and to act a part, they became all too busily engaged in the scene to be spectators of it. Thus neither the uncle nor nephew saw any symptoms of suspicion in the mother or daughter; nor did the mother or daughter remark the overacted complacence of the old man, nor the counterfeit satisfaction which grinned in the features of the young one.
Something like this, I believe, frequently happens, where the whole attention of two friends being engaged in the part which each is to act, in order to impose on the other, neither sees nor suspects the arts practised against himself; and thus the thrust of both (to borrow no improper metaphor on the occasion) alike takes place.
From the same reason it is no unusual thing for both parties to be overreached in a bargain, though the one must be always the greater loser; as was he who sold a blind horse, and received a bad note in payment.
706
Our company in about half an hour broke up, and the uncle carried off his nephew; but not before the latter had assured Miss Nancy, in a whisper, that he would attend her early in the morning, and fulfil all his engagements.
Jones, who was the least concerned in this scene, saw the most. He did indeed suspect the very fact; for, besides observing the great alteration in the behaviour of the uncle, the distance he assumed, and his overstrained civility to Miss Nancy; the carrying off a bridegroom from his bride at that time of night was so extraordinary a proceeding that it could be accounted for only by imagining that young Nightingale had revealed the whole truth, which the apparent openness of his temper, and his being flustered with liquor, made too probable.
While he was reasoning with himself, whether he should acquaint these poor people with his suspicion, the maid of the house informed him that a gentlewoman desired to speak with him.--He went imme-
diately out, and, taking the candle from the maid, ushered his visitant upstairs, who, in the person of Mrs Honour, acquainted him with such dreadful news concerning his Sophia, that he immediately lost all consideration for every other person; and his whole stock of compassion was entirely swallowed up in reflections on his own misery, and on that of his unfortunate angel.
What this dreadful matter was, the reader will be informed, after we have first related the many preceding steps which produced it, and those will be the subject of the following book.

Chapter 且
Too short to need a preface.
There are a set of religious, or rather moral writers, who teach that virtue is the certain road to happiness, and vice to misery, in this world. A very wholesome and comfortable doctrine, and to which we have but one objection, namely, that it is not true.
Indeed, if by virtue these writers mean the exercise of those cardinal virtues, which like good housewives stay at home, and mind only the business of their own family, I shall very readily concede the point; for so surely do all these contribute and lead to happiness, that I could almost wish, in violation of all the antient and modern sages, to call them rather by the name of wisdom, than by that of virtue; for, with regard to this life, no system, I conceive, was ever wiser than that of the antient Epicureans, who held this wisdom to constitute the chief good; nor fool-isher than that of their opposites, those modern epicures, who place all felicity in the abundant gratification of every sensual appetite.
But if by virtue is meant (as I almost think it ought) a certain relative quality, which is always busying itself without-doors, and seems as much interested in pursuing the good of others as its own; I cannot so easily agree that this is the surest way to human happiness; because I am afraid we must then include poverty and contempt, with all the mischiefs which backbiting, envy, and ingratitude, can bring on mankind, in our idea of happiness; nay, sometimes perhaps we shall be obliged to wait upon the said happiness to a jail; since many by the above virtue have brought themselves thither.
I have not now leisure to enter upon so large a field of speculation, as here seems opening upon me; my design was to wipe off a doctrine that lay in my way; since, while Mr Jones was acting the most virtuous part imaginable in labouring to preserve his fellow-creatures from destruction, the devil, or some other evil spirit, one perhaps cloathed in human
709
flesh, was hard at work to make him completely miserable in the ruin of his Sophia.
This therefore would seem an exception to the above rule, if indeed it was a rule; but as we have in our voyage through life seen so many other exceptions to it, we chuse to dispute the doctrine on which it is founded, which we don't apprehend to be Christian, which we are convinced is not true, and which is indeed destructive of one of the noblest arguments that reason alone can furnish for the belief of immortality.
But as the reader's curiosity (if he hath any) must be now awake, and hungry, we shall provide to feed it as fast as we can.

Chapter
In which is opened a very black design against Sophia.
I remember a wise old gentleman who used to say, "When children are doing nothing, they are doing mischief." I will not enlarge this quaint saying to the most beautiful part of the creation in general; but so far I may be allowed, that when the effects of female jealousy do not appear openly in their proper colours of rage and fury, we may suspect that mischievous passion to be at work privately, and attempting to undermine, what it doth not attack above-ground.
This was exemplified in the conduct of Lady Bellaston, who, under all the smiles which she wore in her countenance, concealed much indignation against Sophia; and as she plainly saw that this young lady stood between her and the full indulgence of her desires, she resolved to get rid of her by some means or other; nor was it long before a very favourable opportunity of accomplishing this presented itself to her.
The reader may be pleased to remember, that when Sophia was thrown into that consternation at the playhouse, by the wit and humour of a set of young gentlemen who call themselves the town, we informed him, that she had put herself under the protection of a young nobleman, who had very safely conducted her to her chair.
This nobleman, who frequently visited Lady Bellaston, had more than once seen Sophia there, since her arrival in town, and had conceived a very great liking to her; which liking, as beauty never looks more amiable than in distress, Sophia had in this fright so encreased, that he might now, without any great impropriety, be said to be actually in love with her.
It may easily be believed, that he would not suffer so handsome an occasion of improving his acquaintance with the beloved object as now offered itself to elapse, when even good breeding alone might have prompted him to pay her a visit.
711
The next morning therefore, after this accident, he waited on Sophia, with the usual compliments, and hopes that she had received no harm from her last night's adventure.
As love, like fire, when once thoroughly kindled, is soon blown into a flame, Sophia in a very short time compleated her conquest. Time now flew away unperceived, and the noble lord had been two hours in company with the lady, before it entered into his head that he had made too long a visit. Though this circumstance alone would have alarmed Sophia, who was somewhat more a mistress of computation at present; she had indeed much more pregnant evidence from the eyes of her lover of what past within his bosom; nay, though he did not make any open declaration of his passion, yet many of his expressions were rather too warm, and too tender, to have been imputed to complacence, even in the age when such complacence was in fashion; the very reverse of which is well known to be the reigning mode at present.
Lady Bellaston had been apprized of his lordship's visit at his first arrival; and the length of it very well satisfied her, that things went as she wished, and as indeed she had suspected the second time she saw this young couple together. This business, she rightly I think concluded, that she should by no means forward by mixing in the company while they were together; she therefore ordered her servants, that when my lord was going, they should tell him she desired to speak with him; and employed the intermediate time in meditating how best to accomplish a scheme, which she made no doubt but his lordship would very readily embrace the execution of.
Lord Fellamar (for that was the title of this young nobleman) was no sooner introduced to her ladyship, than she attacked him in the following strain: "Bless me, my lord, are you here yet? I thought my servants had made a mistake, and let you go away; and I wanted to see you about an affair of some importance."----"Indeed, Lady Bellaston," said he, "I
don't wonder you are astonished at the length of my visit; for I have staid above two hours, and I did not think I had staid above half-a-one."----"What am I to conclude from thence, my lord?" said she. "The
company must be very agreeable which can make time slide away so very deceitfully."---"Upon my honour," said he, "the most agreeable I
ever saw. Pray tell me, Lady Bellaston, who is this blazing star which you have produced among us all of a sudden?"-------"What blazing star,
my lord?" said she, affecting a surprize. "I mean," said he, "the lady I saw here the other day, whom I had last night in my arms at the playhouse, and to whom I have been making that unreasonable visit."-------"O, my
712
cousin Western!" said she; "why, that blazing star, my lord, is the daughter of a country booby squire, and hath been in town about a fortnight, for the first time."---"Upon my soul," said he, "I should swear she had
been bred up in a court; for besides her beauty, I never saw anything so genteel, so sensible, so polite."---"O brave!" cries the lady, "my cousin
hath you, I find."-----"Upon my honour," answered he, "I wish she had;
for I am in love with her to distraction."----"Nay, my lord," said she, "it
is not wishing yourself very ill neither, for she is a very great fortune: I assure you she is an only child, and her father's estate is a good £3000 a-year." "Then I can assure you, madam," answered the lord, "I think her the best match in England." "Indeed, my lord," replied she, "if you like her, I heartily wish you had her." "If you think so kindly of me, madam," said he, "as she is a relation of yours, will you do me the honour to propose it to her father?" "And are you really then in earnest?" cries the lady, with an affected gravity. "I hope, madam," answered he, "you have a better opinion of me, than to imagine I would jest with your ladyship in an affair of this kind." "Indeed, then," said the lady, "I will most readily propose your lordship to her father; and I can, I believe, assure you of his joyful acceptance of the proposal; but there is a bar, which I am almost ashamed to mention; and yet it is one you will never be able to conquer. You have a rival, my lord, and a rival who, though I blush to name him, neither you, nor all the world, will ever be able to conquer." "Upon my word, Lady Bellaston," cries he, "you have struck a damp to my heart, which hath almost deprived me of being." "Fie, my lord," said she, "I should rather hope I had struck fire into you. A lover, and talk of damps in your heart! I rather imagined you would have asked your rival's name, that you might have immediately entered the lists with him." "I promise you, madam," answered he, "there are very few things I would not undertake for your charming cousin; but pray, who is this happy man?"一"Why, he is," said she, "what I am sorry to say most happy men with us are, one of the lowest fellows in the world. He is a beggar, a bastard, a foundling, a fellow in meaner circumstances than one of your lordship's footmen." "And is it possible," cried he, "that a young creature with such perfections should think of bestowing herself so unworthily?" "Alas! my lord," answered she, "consider the country—the bane of all young women is the country. There they learn a set of romantic notions of love, and I know not what folly, which this town and good company can scarce eradicate in a whole winter." "Indeed, madam," replied my lord, "your cousin is of too immense a value to be thrown away; such ruin as this must be prevented." "Alas!" cries she, "my lord, how can it be
713
prevented? The family have already done all in their power; but the girl is, I think, intoxicated, and nothing less than ruin will content her. And to deal more openly with you, I expect every day to hear she is run away with him." "What you tell me, Lady Bellaston," answered his lordship, "affects me most tenderly, and only raises my compassion, instead of lessening my adoration of your cousin. Some means must be found to preserve so inestimable a jewel. Hath your ladyship endeavoured to reason with her?" Here the lady affected a laugh, and cried, "My dear lord, sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young woman out of her inclinations? These inestimable jewels are as deaf as the jewels they wear: time, my lord, time is the only medicine to cure their folly; but this is a medicine which I am certain she will not take; nay, I live in hourly horrors on her account. In short, nothing but violent methods will do." "What is to be done?" cries my lord; "what methods are to be taken?一Is there any method upon earth?一Oh! Lady Bellaston! there is nothing which I would not undertake for such a reward."-------"I really
know not," answered the lady, after a pause; and then pausing again, she cried out一"Upon my soul, I am at my wit's end on this girl's account.一If she can be preserved, something must be done immediately; and, as I say, nothing but violent methods will do.----If your lordship
hath really this attachment to my cousin (and to do her justice, except in this silly inclination, of which she will soon see her folly, she is every way deserving), I think there may be one way, indeed, it is a very disagreeable one, and what I am almost afraid to think of.一It requires a great spirit, I promise you." "I am not conscious, madam," said he, "of any defect there; nor am I, I hope, suspected of any such. It must be an egregious defect indeed, which could make me backward on this occasion." "Nay, my lord," answered she, "I am so far from doubting you, I am much more inclined to doubt my own courage; for I must run a monstrous risque. In short, I must place such a confidence in your honour as a wise woman will scarce ever place in a man on any consideration." In this point likewise my lord very well satisfied her; for his reputation was extremely clear, and common fame did him no more than justice, in speaking well of him. "Well, then," said she, "my lord,一I一I vow, I can't bear the apprehension of it.一No, it must not be.---At least every other
method shall be tried. Can you get rid of your engagements, and dine here to-day? Your lordship will have an opportunity of seeing a little more of Miss Western.一I promise you we have no time to lose. Here will be nobody but Lady Betty, and Miss Eagle, and Colonel Hampsted, and Tom Edwards; they will all go soon一and I shall be at home to
714
nobody. Then your lordship may be a little more explicit. Nay, I will contrive some method to convince you of her attachment to this fellow." My lord made proper compliments, accepted the invitation, and then they parted to dress, it being now past three in the morning, or to reckon by the old style, in the afternoon.

Chapter U
A further explanation of the foregoing design.
Though the reader may have long since concluded Lady Bellaston to be a member (and no inconsiderable one) of the great world; she was in reality a very considerable member of the little world; by which appellation was distinguished a very worthy and honourable society which not long since flourished in this kingdom.
Among other good principles upon which this society was founded, there was one very remarkable; for, as it was a rule of an honourable club of heroes, who assembled at the close of the late war, that all the members should every day fight once at least; so 'twas in this, that every member should, within the twenty-four hours, tell at least one merry fib, which was to be propagated by all the brethren and sisterhood.
Many idle stories were told about this society, which from a certain quality may be, perhaps not unjustly, supposed to have come from the society themselves. As, that the devil was the president; and that he sat in person in an elbow-chair at the upper end of the table; but, upon very strict enquiry, I find there is not the least truth in any of those tales, and that the assembly consisted in reality of a set of very good sort of people, and the fibs which they propagated were of a harmless kind, and tended only to produce mirth and good humour.
Edwards was likewise a member of this comical society. To him therefore Lady Bellaston applied as a proper instrument for her purpose, and furnished him with a fib, which he was to vent whenever the lady gave him her cue; and this was not to be till the evening, when all the company but Lord Fellamar and himself were gone, and while they were engaged in a rubber at whist.
To this time then, which was between seven and eight in the evening, we will convey our reader; when Lady Bellaston, Lord Fellamar, Miss Western, and Tom, being engaged at whist, and in the last game of their rubbers, Tom received his cue from Lady Bellaston, which was, "I
716
protest, Tom, you are grown intolerable lately; you used to tell us all the news of the town, and now you know no more of the world than if you lived out of it."
Mr Edwards then began as follows: "The fault is not mine, madam: it lies in the dulness of the age, that doth nothing worth talking of.-O
la! though now I think on't there hath a terrible accident befallen poor Colonel Wilcox.----Poor Ned.-----You know him, my lord, everybody
knows him; faith! I am very much concerned for him."
"What is it, pray?" says Lady Bellaston.
"Why, he hath killed a man this morning in a duel, that's all."
His lordship, who was not in the secret, asked gravely, whom he had killed? To which Edwards answered, "A young fellow we none of us know; a Somersetshire lad just came to town, one Jones his name is; a near relation of one Mr Allworthy, of whom your lordship I believe hath heard. I saw the lad lie dead in a coffee-house.一Upon my soul, he is one of the finest corpses I ever saw in my life!"
Sophia, who had just began to deal as Tom had mentioned that a man was killed, stopt her hand, and listened with attention (for all stories of that kind affected her), but no sooner had he arrived at the latter part of the story than she began to deal again; and having dealt three cards to one, and seven to another, and ten to a third, at last dropt the rest from her hand, and fell back in her chair.
The company behaved as usually on these occasions. The usual disturbance ensued, the usual assistance was summoned, and Sophia at last, as it is usual, returned again to life, and was soon after, at her earnest desire, led to her own apartment; where, at my lord's request, Lady Bella-ston acquainted her with the truth, attempted to carry it off as a jest of her own, and comforted her with repeated assurances, that neither his lordship nor Tom, though she had taught him the story, were in the true secret of the affair.
There was no farther evidence necessary to convince Lord Fellamar how justly the case had been represented to him by Lady Bellaston; and now, at her return into the room, a scheme was laid between these two noble persons, which, though it appeared in no very heinous light to his lordship (as he faithfully promised, and faithfully resolved too, to make the lady all the subsequent amends in his power by marriage), yet many of our readers, we doubt not, will see with just detestation.
717
The next evening at seven was appointed for the fatal purpose, when Lady Bellaston undertook that Sophia should be alone, and his lordship should be introduced to her. The whole family were to be regulated for the purpose, most of the servants despatched out of the house; and for Mrs Honour, who, to prevent suspicion, was to be left with her mistress till his lordship's arrival, Lady Bellaston herself was to engage her in an apartment as distant as possible from the scene of the intended mischief, and out of the hearing of Sophia.
Matters being thus agreed on, his lordship took his leave, and her ladyship retired to rest, highly pleased with a project, of which she had no reason to doubt the success, and which promised so effectually to remove Sophia from being any further obstruction to her amour with Jones, by a means of which she should never appear to be guilty, even if the fact appeared to the world; but this she made no doubt of preventing by huddling up a marriage, to which she thought the ravished Sophia would easily be brought to consent, and at which all the rest of her family would rejoice.
But affairs were not in so quiet a situation in the bosom of the other conspirator; his mind was tost in all the distracting anxiety so nobly described by Shakespear一
"Between the acting of a dreadful thing, And the first motion, all the interim is Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream; The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council; and the state of man, Like to a little kingdom, suffers then The nature of an insurrection."-
Though the violence of his passion had made him eagerly embrace the first hint of this design, especially as it came from a relation of the lady, yet when that friend to reflection, a pillow, had placed the action itself in all its natural black colours before his eyes, with all the consequences which must, and those which might probably attend it, his resolution began to abate, or rather indeed to go over to the other side; and after a long conflict, which lasted a whole night, between honour and appetite, the former at length prevailed, and he determined to wait on Lady Bella-ston, and to relinquish the design.
Lady Bellaston was in bed, though very late in the morning, and Sophia sitting by her bed-side, when the servant acquainted her that Lord Fellamar was below in the parlour; upon which her ladyship desired him to stay, and that she would see him presently; but the servant was no sooner departed than poor Sophia began to intreat her cousin not to encourage the visits of that odious lord (so she called him, though a
718
little unjustly) upon her account. "I see his design," said she; "for he made downright love to me yesterday morning; but as I am resolved never to admit it, I beg your ladyship not to leave us alone together any more, and to order the servants that, if he enquires for me, I may be always denied to him."
"La! child," says Lady Bellaston, "you country girls have nothing but sweethearts in your head; you fancy every man who is civil to you is making love. He is one of the most gallant young fellows about town, and I am convinced means no more than a little gallantry. Make love to you indeed! I wish with all my heart he would, and you must be an arrant mad woman to refuse him."
"But as I shall certainly be that mad woman," cries Sophia, "I hope his visits shall not be intruded upon me."
"O child!" said Lady Bellaston, "you need not be so fearful; if you resolve to run away with that Jones, I know no person who can hinder you."
"Upon my honour, madam," cries Sophia, "your ladyship injures me. I will never run away with any man; nor will I ever marry contrary to my father's inclinations."
"Well, Miss Western," said the lady, "if you are not in a humour to see company this morning, you may retire to your own apartment; for I am not frightened at his lordship, and must send for him up into my dressing-room."
Sophia thanked her ladyship, and withdrew; and presently afterwards Fellamar was admitted upstairs.
719
By which it will appear how dangerous an advocate a lady is when she applies her eloquence to an ill purpose.
When Lady Bellaston heard the young lord's scruples, she treated them with the same disdain with which one of those sages of the law, called Newgate solicitors, treats the qualms of conscience in a young witness. "My dear lord," said she, "you certainly want a cordial. I must send to Lady Edgely for one of her best drams. Fie upon it! have more resolution. Are you frightened by the word rape? Or are you apprehensive----? Well! if the story of Helen was modern, I should think it unnat-
ural. I mean the behaviour of Paris, not the fondness of the lady; for all women love a man of spirit. There is another story of the Sabine ladies一and that too, I thank heaven, is very antient. Your lordship, perhaps, will admire my reading; but I think Mr Hook tells us, they made tolerable good wives afterwards. I fancy few of my married acquaintance were ravished by their husbands." "Nay, dear Lady Bellaston," cried he, "don't ridicule me in this manner." "Why, my good lord," answered she, "do you think any woman in England would not laugh at you in her heart, whatever prudery she might wear in her countenance?---------You
force me to use a strange kind of language, and to betray my sex most abominably; but I am contented with knowing my intentions are good, and that I am endeavouring to serve my cousin; for I think you will make her a husband notwithstanding this; or, upon my soul, I would not even persuade her to fling herself away upon an empty title. She should not upbraid me hereafter with having lost a man of spirit; for that his enemies allow this poor young fellow to be."
Let those who have had the satisfaction of hearing reflections of this kind from a wife or a mistress, declare whether they are at all sweetened by coming from a female tongue. Certain it is, they sunk deeper into his lordship than anything which Demosthenes or Cicero could have said on the occasion.
720
Lady Bellaston, perceiving she had fired the young lord's pride, began now, like a true orator, to rouse other passions to its assistance. "My lord," says she, in a graver voice, "you will be pleased to remember, you mentioned this matter to me first; for I would not appear to you in the light of one who is endeavouring to put off my cousin upon you. Fourscore thousand pounds do not stand in need of an advocate to recommend them." "Nor doth Miss Western," said he, "require any recommendation from her fortune; for, in my opinion, no woman ever had half her charms." "Yes, yes, my lord," replied the lady, looking in the glass, "there have been women with more than half her charms, I assure you; not that I need lessen her on that account: she is a most delicious girl, that's certain; and within these few hours she will be in the arms of one, who surely doth not deserve her, though I will give him his due, I believe he is truly a man of spirit."
"I hope so, madam," said my lord; "though I must own he doth not deserve her; for, unless heaven or your ladyship disappoint me, she shall within that time be in mine."
"Well spoken, my lord," answered the lady; "I promise you no disappointment shall happen from my side; and within this week I am convinced I shall call your lordship my cousin in public."
The remainder of this scene consisted entirely of raptures, excuses, and compliments, very pleasant to have heard from the parties; but rather dull when related at second hand. Here, therefore, we shall put an end to this dialogue, and hasten to the fatal hour when everything was prepared for the destruction of poor Sophia.
But this being the most tragical matter in our whole history, we shall treat it in a chapter by itself.

Chapter U
Containing some matters which may affect, and others which may surprize, the reader.
The clock had now struck seven, and poor Sophia, alone and melancholy, sat reading a tragedy. It was the Fatal Marriage; and she was now come to that part where the poor distrest Isabella disposes of her wedding-ring.
Here the book dropt from her hand, and a shower of tears ran down into her bosom. In this situation she had continued a minute, when the door opened, and in came Lord Fellamar. Sophia started from her chair at his entrance; and his lordship advancing forwards, and making a low bow, said, "I am afraid, Miss Western, I break in upon you abruptly." "Indeed, my lord," says she, "I must own myself a little surprized at this unexpected visit." "If this visit be unexpected, madam," answered Lord Fellamar, "my eyes must have been very faithless interpreters of my heart, when last I had the honour of seeing you; for surely you could not otherwise have hoped to detain my heart in your possession, without receiving a visit from its owner." Sophia, confused as she was, answered this bombast (and very properly I think) with a look of inconceivable disdain. My lord then made another and a longer speech of the same sort. Upon which Sophia, trembling, said, "Am I really to conceive your lordship to be out of your senses? Sure, my lord, there is no other excuse for such behaviour." "I am, indeed, madam, in the situation you suppose," cries his lordship; "and sure you will pardon the effects of a frenzy which you yourself have occasioned; for love hath so totally deprived me of reason, that I am scarce accountable for any of my actions." "Upon my word, my lord," said Sophia, "I neither understand your words nor your behaviour." "Suffer me then, madam," cries he, "at your feet to explain both, by laying open my soul to you, and declaring that I doat on you to the highest degree of distraction. O most adorable, most divine creature! what language can express the sentiments of my heart?" "I do assure you, my lord," said Sophia, "I shall not stay to hear any more of this." "Do
722
not," cries he, "think of leaving me thus cruelly; could you know half the torments which I feel, that tender bosom must pity what those eyes have caused." Then fetching a deep sigh, and laying hold of her hand, he ran on for some minutes in a strain which would be little more pleasing to the reader than it was to the lady; and at last concluded with a declaration, "That if he was master of the world, he would lay it at her feet." Sophia then, forcibly pulling away her hand from his, answered with much spirit, "I promise you, sir, your world and its master I should spurn from me with equal contempt." She then offered to go; and Lord Fellamar, again laying hold of her hand, said, "Pardon me, my beloved angel, freedoms which nothing but despair could have tempted me to take.----Believe me, could I have had any hope that my title and for-
tune, neither of them inconsiderable, unless when compared with your worth, would have been accepted, I had, in the humblest manner, presented them to your acceptance.---But I cannot lose you.一By heav-
en, I will sooner part with my soul!一You are, you must, you shall be only mine." "My lord," says she, "I intreat you to desist from a vain pursuit; for, upon my honour, I will never hear you on this subject. Let go my hand, my lord; for I am resolved to go from you this moment; nor will I ever see you more." "Then, madam," cries his lordship, "I must make the best use of this moment; for I cannot live, nor will I live without you."----"What do you mean, my lord?" said Sophia; "I will
raise the family." "I have no fear, madam," answered he, "but of losing you, and that I am resolved to prevent, the only way which despair points to me."一He then caught her in his arms: upon which she screamed so loud, that she must have alarmed some one to her assistance, had not Lady Bellaston taken care to remove all ears.
But a more lucky circumstance happened for poor Sophia; another noise now broke forth, which almost drowned her cries; for now the whole house rang with, "Where is she? D一n me, I'll unkennel her this instant. Show me her chamber, I say. Where is my daughter? I know she's in the house, and I'll see her if she's above-ground. Show me where she is."一At which last words the door flew open, and in came Squire Western, with his parson and a set of myrmidons at his heels.
How miserable must have been the condition of poor Sophia, when the enraged voice of her father was welcome to her ears! Welcome indeed it was, and luckily did he come; for it was the only accident upon earth which could have preserved the peace of her mind from being for ever destroyed.
723
Sophia, notwithstanding her fright, presently knew her father's voice; and his lordship, notwithstanding his passion, knew the voice of reason, which peremptorily assured him, it was not now a time for the perpetration of his villany. Hearing, therefore, the voice approach, and hearing likewise whose it was (for as the squire more than once roared forth the word daughter, so Sophia, in the midst of her struggling, cried out upon her father), he thought proper to relinquish his prey, having only disordered her handkerchief, and with his rude lips committed violence on her lovely neck.
If the reader's imagination doth not assist me, I shall never be able to describe the situation of these two persons when Western came into the room. Sophia tottered into a chair, where she sat disordered, pale, breathless, bursting with indignation at Lord Fellamar; affrighted, and yet more rejoiced, at the arrival of her father.
His lordship sat down near her, with the bag of his wig hanging over one of his shoulders, the rest of his dress being somewhat disordered, and rather a greater proportion of linen than is usual appearing at his bosom. As to the rest, he was amazed, affrighted, vexed, and ashamed.
As to Squire Western, he happened at this time to be overtaken by an enemy, which very frequently pursues, and seldom fails to overtake, most of the country gentlemen in this kingdom. He was, literally speaking, drunk; which circumstance, together with his natural impetuosity, could produce no other effect than his running immediately up to his daughter, upon whom he fell foul with his tongue in the most inveterate manner; nay, he had probably committed violence with his hands, had not the parson interposed, saying, "For heaven's sake, sir, animadvert that you are in the house of a great lady. Let me beg you to mitigate your wrath; it should minister a fulness of satisfaction that you have found your daughter; for as to revenge, it belongeth not unto us. I discern great contrition in the countenance of the young lady. I stand assured, if you will forgive her, she will repent her of all past offences, and return unto her duty."
The strength of the parson's arms had at first been of more service than the strength of his rhetoric. However, his last words wrought some effect, and the squire answered, "I'll forgee her if she wull ha un. If wot ha un, Sophy, I'll forgee thee all. Why dost unt speak? Shat ha un! d一n me, shat ha un! Why dost unt answer? Was ever such a stubborn tuoad?"
724
"Let me intreat you, sir, to be a little more moderate," said the parson; "you frighten the young lady so, that you deprive her of all power of utterance."
"Power of mine a一," answered the squire. "You take her part then, you do? A pretty parson, truly, to side with an undutiful child! Yes, yes, I will gee you a living with a pox. I'll gee un to the devil sooner."
"I humbly crave your pardon," said the parson; "I assure your worship I meant no such matter."
My Lady Bellaston now entered the room, and came up to the squire, who no sooner saw her, than, resolving to follow the instructions of his sister, he made her a very civil bow, in the rural manner, and paid her some of his best compliments. He then immediately proceeded to his complaints, and said, "There, my lady cousin; there stands the most un-dutiful child in the world; she hankers after a beggarly rascal, and won't marry one of the greatest matches in all England, that we have provided for her."
"Indeed, cousin Western," answered the lady, "I am persuaded you wrong my cousin. I am sure she hath a better understanding. I am convinced she will not refuse what she must be sensible is so much to her advantage."
This was a wilful mistake in Lady Bellaston, for she well knew whom Mr Western meant; though perhaps she thought he would easily be reconciled to his lordship's proposals.
"Do you hear there," quoth the squire, "what her ladyship says? All your family are for the match. Come, Sophy, be a good girl, and be dutiful, and make your father happy."
"If my death will make you happy, sir," answered Sophia, "you will shortly be so."
"It's a lye, Sophy; it's a d一n'd lye, and you know it," said the squire.
"Indeed, Miss Western," said Lady Bellaston, "you injure your father; he hath nothing in view but your interest in this match; and I and all your friends must acknowledge the highest honour done to your family in the proposal."
"Ay, all of us," quoth the squire; "nay, it was no proposal of mine. She knows it was her aunt proposed it to me first.—Come, Sophy, once more let me beg you to be a good girl, and gee me your consent before your cousin."
725
"Let me give him your hand, cousin," said the lady. "It is the fashion now-a-days to dispense with time and long courtships."
"Pugh!" said the squire, "what signifies time; won't they have time enough to court afterwards? People may court very well after they have been a-bed together."
As Lord Fellamar was very well assured that he was meant by Lady Bellaston, so, never having heard nor suspected a word of Blifil, he made no doubt of his being meant by the father. Coming up, therefore, to the squire, he said, "Though I have not the honour, sir, of being personally known to you, yet, as I find I have the happiness to have my proposals accepted, let me intercede, sir, in behalf of the young lady, that she may not be more solicited at this time."
"You intercede, sir!" said the squire; "why, who the devil are you?"
"Sir, I am Lord Fellamar," answered he, "and am the happy man whom I hope you have done the honour of accepting for a son-in-law."
"You are a son of a b----," replied the squire, "for all your laced coat.
You my son-in-law, and be d一n'd to you!"
"I shall take more from you, sir, than from any man," answered the lord; "but I must inform you that I am not used to hear such language without resentment."
"Resent my a一," quoth the squire. "Don't think I am afraid of such a fellow as thee art! because hast got a spit there dangling at thy side. Lay by your spit, and I'll give thee enough of meddling with what doth not belong to thee. I'll teach you to father-in-law me. I'll lick thy jacket."
"It's very well, sir," said my lord, "I shall make no disturbance before the ladies. I am very well satisfied. Your humble servant, sir; Lady Bella-ston, your most obedient."
His lordship was no sooner gone, than Lady Bellaston, coming up to Mr Western, said, "Bless me, sir, what have you done? You know not whom you have affronted; he is a nobleman of the first rank and fortune, and yesterday made proposals to your daughter; and such as I am sure you must accept with the highest pleasure."
"Answer for yourself, lady cousin," said the squire, "I will have nothing to do with any of your lords. My daughter shall have an honest country gentleman; I have pitched upon one for her一and she shall ha' un.一I am sorry for the trouble she hath given your ladyship with all my heart." Lady Bellaston made a civil speech upon the word trouble; to which the squire answered一"Why, that's kind一and I would do as much
726
for your ladyship. To be sure relations should do for one another. So I wish your ladyship a good night.一Come, madam, you must go along with me by fair means, or I'll have you carried down to the coach."
Sophia said she would attend him without force; but begged to go in a chair, for she said she should not be able to ride any other way.
"Prithee," cries the squire, "wout unt persuade me canst not ride in a coach, wouldst? That's a pretty thing surely! No, no, I'll never let thee out of my sight any more till art married, that I promise thee." Sophia told him, she saw he was resolved to break her heart. "O break thy heart and be d—n'd," quoth he, "if a good husband will break it. I don't value a brass varden, not a halfpenny, of any undutiful b一 upon earth." He then took violent hold of her hand; upon which the parson once more interfered, begging him to use gentle methods. At that the squire thundered out a curse, and bid the parson hold his tongue, saying, "At'nt in pulpit now? when art a got up there I never mind what dost say; but I won't be priest-ridden, nor taught how to behave myself by thee. I wish your ladyship a good-night. Come along, Sophy; be a good girl, and all shall be well. Shat ha' un, d—n me, shat ha' un!"
Mrs Honour appeared below-stairs, and with a low curtesy to the squire offered to attend her mistress; but he pushed her away, saying, "Hold, madam, hold, you come no more near my house." "And will you take my maid away from me?" said Sophia. "Yes, indeed, madam, will I," cries the squire: "you need not fear being without a servant; I will get you another maid, and a better maid than this, who, I'd lay five pounds to a crown, is no more a maid than my grannum. No, no, Sophy, she shall contrive no more escapes, I promise you." He then packed up his daughter and the parson into the hackney coach, after which he mounted himself, and ordered it to drive to his lodgings. In the way thither he suffered Sophia to be quiet, and entertained himself with reading a lecture to the parson on good manners, and a proper behaviour to his betters.
It is possible he might not so easily have carried off his daughter from Lady Bellaston, had that good lady desired to have detained her; but, in reality, she was not a little pleased with the confinement into which Sophia was going; and as her project with Lord Fellamar had failed of success, she was well contented that other violent methods were now going to be used in favour of another man.

By what means the squire came to discover his daughter.
Though the reader, in many histories, is obliged to digest much more unaccountable appearances than this of Mr Western, without any satisfaction at all; yet, as we dearly love to oblige him whenever it is in our power, we shall now proceed to shew by what method the squire discovered where his daughter was.
In the third chapter, then, of the preceding book, we gave a hint (for it is not our custom to unfold at any time more than is necessary for the occasion) that Mrs Fitzpatrick, who was very desirous of reconciling her uncle and aunt Western, thought she had a probable opportunity, by the service of preserving Sophia from committing the same crime which had drawn on herself the anger of her family. After much deliberation, therefore, she resolved to inform her aunt Western where her cousin was, and accordingly she writ the following letter, which we shall give the reader at length, for more reasons than one.
"HONOURED MADAM,
"The occasion of my writing this will perhaps make a letter of mine agreeable to my dear aunt, for the sake of one of her nieces, though I have little reason to hope it will be so on the account of another.
"Without more apology, as I was coming to throw my unhappy self at your feet, I met, by the strangest accident in the world, my cousin Sophy, whose history you are better acquainted with than myself, though, alas! I know infinitely too much; enough indeed to satisfy me, that unless she is immediately prevented, she is in danger of running into the same fatal mischief, which, by foolishly and ignorantly refusing your most wise and prudent advice, I have unfortunately brought on myself.
"In short, I have seen the man, nay, I was most part of yesterday in his company, and a charming young fellow I promise you he is. By what accident he came acquainted with me is too tedious to tell you now; but I have this morning changed my lodgings to avoid him, lest he should by
728
my means discover my cousin; for he doth not yet know where she is, and it is adviseable he should not, till my uncle hath secured her.-No
time therefore is to be lost; and I need only inform you, that she is now with Lady Bellaston, whom I have seen, and who hath, I find, a design of concealing her from her family. You know, madam, she is a strange woman; but nothing could misbecome me more than to presume to give any hint to one of your great understanding and great knowledge of the world, besides barely informing you of the matter of fact.
"I hope, madam, the care which I have shewn on this occasion for the good of my family will recommend me again to the favour of a lady who hath always exerted so much zeal for the honour and true interest of us all; and that it may be a means of restoring me to your friendship, which hath made so great a part of my former, and is so necessary to my future happiness.
"I am, with the utmost respect, honoured madam, your most dutiful obliged niece, and most obedient humble servant, HARRIET FITZPATRICK."
Mrs Western was now at her brother's house, where she had resided ever since the flight of Sophia, in order to administer comfort to the poor squire in his affliction. Of this comfort, which she doled out to him in daily portions, we have formerly given a specimen.
She was now standing with her back to the fire, and, with a pinch of snuff in her hand, was dealing forth this daily allowance of comfort to the squire, while he smoaked his afternoon pipe, when she received the above letter; which she had no sooner read than she delivered it to him, saying, "There, sir, there is an account of your lost sheep. Fortune hath again restored her to you, and if you will be governed by my advice, it is possible you may yet preserve her."
The squire had no sooner read the letter than he leaped from his chair, threw his pipe into the fire, and gave a loud huzza for joy. He then summoned his servants, called for his boots, and ordered the Chevalier and several other horses to be saddled, and that parson Supple should be immediately sent for. Having done this, he turned to his sister, caught her in his arms, and gave her a close embrace, saying, "Zounds! you don't seem pleased; one would imagine you was sorry I have found the girl."
"Brother," answered she, "the deepest politicians, who see to the bottom, discover often a very different aspect of affairs, from what swims on the surface. It is true, indeed, things do look rather less desperate than
729
they did formerly in Holland, when Lewis the Fourteenth was at the gates of Amsterdam; but there is a delicacy required in this matter, which you will pardon me, brother, if I suspect you want. There is a decorum to be used with a woman of figure, such as Lady Bellaston, brother, which requires a knowledge of the world, superior, I am afraid, to yours."
"Sister," cries the squire, "I know you have no opinion of my parts; but I'll shew you on this occasion who is a fool. Knowledge, quotha! I have not been in the country so long without having some knowledge of warrants and the law of the land. I know I may take my own wherever I can find it. Shew me my own daughter, and if I don't know how to come at her, I'll suffer you to call me a fool as long as I live. There be justices of peace in London, as well as in other places."
"I protest," cries she, "you make me tremble for the event of this matter, which, if you will proceed by my advice, you may bring to so good an issue. Do you really imagine, brother, that the house of a woman of figure is to be attacked by warrants and brutal justices of the peace? I will inform you how to proceed. As soon as you arrive in town, and have got yourself into a decent dress (for indeed, brother, you have none at present fit to appear in), you must send your compliments to Lady Bella-ston, and desire leave to wait on her. When you are admitted to her presence, as you certainly will be, and have told her your story, and have made proper use of my name (for I think you just know one another only by sight, though you are relations), I am confident she will withdraw her protection from my niece, who hath certainly imposed upon her. This is the only method.一Justices of peace, indeed! do you imagine any such event can arrive to a woman of figure in a civilised nation?"
"D一n their figures," cries the squire; "a pretty civilised nation, truly, where women are above the law. And what must I stand sending a parcel of compliments to a confounded whore, that keeps away a daughter from her own natural father? I tell you, sister, I am not so ignorant as you think me----1 know you would have women above the law, but it is
all a lye; I heard his lordship say at size, that no one is above the law. But this of yours is Hanover law, I suppose."
"Mr Western," said she, "I think you daily improve in ignorance.-1
protest you are grown an arrant bear."
"No more a bear than yourself, sister Western," said the squire.一"Pox! you may talk of your civility an you will, I am sure you never shew any to me. I am no bear, no, nor no dog neither, though I know somebody,
730
that is something that begins with a b; but pox! I will show you I have got more good manners than some folks."
"Mr Western," answered the lady, "you may say what you please, je vous mesprise de tout mon coeur. I shall not therefore be angry.-Besides,
as my cousin, with that odious Irish name, justly says, I have that regard for the honour and true interest of my family, and that concern for my niece, who is a part of it, that I have resolved to go to town myself upon this occasion; for indeed, indeed, brother, you are not a fit minister to be employed at a polite court.一Greenland一Greenland should always be the scene of the tramontane negociation."
"I thank Heaven," cries the squire, "I don't understand you now. You are got to your Hanoverian linguo. However, I'll shew you I scorn to be behind-hand in civility with you; and as you are not angry for what I have said, so I am not angry for what you have said. Indeed I have always thought it a folly for relations to quarrel; and if they do now and then give a hasty word, why, people should give and take; for my part, I never bear malice; and I take it very kind of you to go up to London; for I never was there but twice in my life, and then I did not stay above a fortnight at a time, and to be sure I can't be expected to know much of the streets and the folks in that time. I never denied that you know'd all these matters better than I. For me to dispute that would be all as one as for you to dispute the management of a pack of dogs, or the finding a hare sitting, with me."一"Which I promise you," says she, "I never will."一"Well, and I promise you," returned he, "that I never will dispute the t'other."
Here then a league was struck (to borrow a phrase from the lady) between the contending parties; and now the parson arriving, and the horses being ready, the squire departed, having promised his sister to follow her advice, and she prepared to follow him the next day.
But having communicated these matters to the parson on the road, they both agreed that the prescribed formalities might very well be dispensed with; and the squire, having changed his mind, proceeded in the manner we have already seen.

Chapter /
In which various misfortunes befel poor Jones.
Affairs were in the aforesaid situation when Mrs Honour arrived at Mrs Miller's, and called Jones out from the company, as we have before seen, with whom, when she found herself alone, she began as follows:一
"O, my dear sir! how shall I get spirits to tell you; you are undone, sir, and my poor lady's undone, and I am undone." "Hath anything happened to Sophia?" cries Jones, staring like a madman. "All that is bad," cries Honour: "Oh, I shall never get such another lady! Oh that I should ever live to see this day!" At these words Jones turned pale as ashes, trembled, and stammered; but Honour went on一"O! Mr Jones, I have lost my lady for ever." "How? what! for Heaven's sake, tell me. O, my dear Sophia!" "You may well call her so," said Honour; "she was the dearest lady to me. I shall never have such another place." "D一n your place!" cries Jones; "where is—what—what is become of my Sophia?" "Ay, to be sure," cries she, "servants may be d一n'd. It signifies nothing what becomes of them, though they are turned away, and ruined ever so much. To be sure they are not flesh and blood like other people. No, to be sure, it signifies nothing what becomes of them." "If you have any pity, any compassion," cries Jones, "I beg you will instantly tell me what hath happened to Sophia?" "To be sure, I have more pity for you than you have for me," answered Honour; "I don't d一n you because you have lost the sweetest lady in the world. To be sure you are worthy to be pitied, and I am worthy to be pitied too: for, to be sure, if ever there was a good mistress--" "What hath happened?" cries Jones, in almost a
raving fit. "What?一What?" said Honour: "Why, the worst that could have happened both for you and for me.一Her father is come to town, and hath carried her away from us both." Here Jones fell on his knees in thanksgiving that it was no worse. "No worse!" repeated Honour; "what could be worse for either of us? He carried her off, swearing she should marry Mr Blifil; that's for your comfort; and, for poor me, I am turned out of doors." "Indeed, Mrs Honour," answered Jones, "you frightened
732
me out of my wits. I imagined some most dreadful sudden accident had happened to Sophia; something, compared to which, even seeing her married to Blifil would be a trifle; but while there is life there are hopes, my dear Honour. Women in this land of liberty, cannot be married by actual brutal force." "To be sure, sir," said she, "that's true. There may be some hopes for you; but alack-a-day! what hopes are there for poor me? And to be sure, sir, you must be sensible I suffer all this upon your account. All the quarrel the squire hath to me is for taking your part, as I have done, against Mr Blifil." "Indeed, Mrs Honour," answered he, "I am sensible of my obligations to you, and will leave nothing in my power undone to make you amends." "Alas! sir," said she, "what can make a servant amends for the loss of one place but the getting another altogether as good?" "Do not despair, Mrs Honour," said Jones, "I hope to reinstate you again in the same." "Alack-a-day, sir," said she, "how can I flatter myself with such hopes when I know it is a thing impossible? for the squire is so set against me: and yet, if you should ever have my lady, as to be sure I now hopes heartily you will; for you are a generous, good-natured gentleman; and I am sure you loves her, and to be sure she loves you as dearly as her own soul; it is a matter in vain to deny it; because as why, everybody, that is in the least acquainted with my lady, must see it; for, poor dear lady, she can't dissemble: and if two people who loves one another a'n't happy, why who should be so? Happiness don't always depend upon what people has; besides, my lady has enough for both. To be sure, therefore, as one may say, it would be all the pity in the world to keep two such loviers asunder; nay, I am convinced, for my part, you will meet together at last; for, if it is to be, there is no preventing it. If a marriage is made in heaven, all the justices of peace upon earth can't break it off. To be sure I wishes that parson Supple had but a little more spirit, to tell the squire of his wickedness in endeavouring to force his daughter contrary to her liking; but then his whole dependance is on the squire; and so the poor gentleman, though he is a very religious good sort of man, and talks of the badness of such doings behind the squire's back, yet he dares not say his soul is his own to his face. To be sure I never saw him make so bold as just now; I was afeard the squire would have struck him. I would not have your honour be melancholy, sir, nor despair; things may go better, as long as you are sure of my lady, and that I am certain you may be; for she never will be brought to consent to marry any other man. Indeed I am terribly afeared the squire will do her a mischief in his passion, for he is a prodigious passionate gentleman; and I am afeared too the poor lady will be brought to break her heart, for she
733
is as tender-hearted as a chicken. It is pity, methinks, she had not a little of my courage. If I was in love with a young man, and my father offered to lock me up, I'd tear his eyes out but I'd come at him; but then there's a great fortune in the case, which it is in her father's power either to give her or not; that, to be sure, may make some difference."
Whether Jones gave strict attention to all the foregoing harangue, or whether it was for want of any vacancy in the discourse, I cannot determine; but he never once attempted to answer, nor did she once stop till Partridge came running into the room, and informed him that the great lady was upon the stairs.
Nothing could equal the dilemma to which Jones was now reduced. Honour knew nothing of any acquaintance that subsisted between him and Lady Bellaston, and she was almost the last person in the world to whom he would have communicated it. In this hurry and distress, he took (as is common enough) the worst course, and, instead of exposing her to the lady, which would have been of little consequence, he chose to expose the lady to her; he therefore resolved to hide Honour, whom he had but just time to convey behind the bed, and to draw the curtains.
The hurry in which Jones had been all day engaged on account of his poor landlady and her family, the terrors occasioned by Mrs Honour, and the confusion into which he was thrown by the sudden arrival of Lady Bellaston, had altogether driven former thoughts out of his head; so that it never once occurred to his memory to act the part of a sick man; which, indeed, neither the gaiety of his dress, nor the freshness of his countenance, would have at all supported.
He received her ladyship therefore rather agreeably to her desires than to her expectations, with all the good humour he could muster in his countenance, and without any real or affected appearance of the least disorder.
Lady Bellaston no sooner entered the room, than she squatted herself down on the bed: "So, my dear Jones," said she, "you find nothing can detain me long from you. Perhaps I ought to be angry with you, that I have neither seen nor heard from you all day; for I perceive your distemper would have suffered you to come abroad: nay, I suppose you have not sat in your chamber all day drest up like a fine lady to see company after a lying-in; but, however, don't think I intend to scold you; for I never will give you an excuse for the cold behaviour of a husband, by putting on the ill-humour of a wife."
734
"Nay, Lady Bellaston," said Jones, "I am sure your ladyship will not upbraid me with neglect of duty, when I only waited for orders. Who, my dear creature, hath reason to complain? Who missed an appointment last night, and left an unhappy man to expect, and wish, and sigh, and languish?"
"Do not mention it, my dear Mr Jones," cried she. "If you knew the occasion, you would pity me. In short, it is impossible to conceive what women of condition are obliged to suffer from the impertinence of fools, in order to keep up the farce of the world. I am glad, however, all your languishing and wishing have done you no harm; for you never looked better in your life. Upon my faith! Jones, you might at this instant sit for the picture of Adonis."
There are certain words of provocation which men of honour hold can properly be answered only by a blow. Among lovers possibly there may be some expressions which can be answered only by a kiss. Now the compliment which Lady Bellaston now made Jones seems to be of this kind, especially as it was attended with a look, in which the lady conveyed more soft ideas than it was possible to express with her tongue.
Jones was certainly at this instant in one of the most disagreeable and distressed situations imaginable; for, to carry on the comparison we made use of before, though the provocation was given by the lady, Jones could not receive satisfaction, nor so much as offer to ask it, in the presence of a third person; seconds in this kind of duels not being according to the law of arms. As this objection did not occur to Lady Bellaston, who was ignorant of any other woman being there but herself, she waited some time in great astonishment for an answer from Jones, who, conscious of the ridiculous figure he made, stood at a distance, and, not daring to give the proper answer, gave none at all. Nothing can be imagined more comic, nor yet more tragical, than this scene would have been if it had lasted much longer. The lady had already changed colour two or three times; had got up from the bed and sat down again, while Jones was wishing the ground to sink under him, or the house to fall on his head, when an odd accident freed him from an embarrassment out of which neither the eloquence of a Cicero, nor the politics of a Machiavel, could have delivered him, without utter disgrace.
This was no other than the arrival of young Nightingale, dead drunk; or rather in that state of drunkenness which deprives men of the use of their reason without depriving them of the use of their limbs.
735
Mrs Miller and her daughters were in bed, and Partridge was smoak-ing his pipe by the kitchen fire; so that he arrived at Mr Jones's chamberdoor without any interruption. This he burst open, and was entering without any ceremony, when Jones started from his seat and ran to oppose him, which he did so effectually, that Nightingale never came far enough within the door to see who was sitting on the bed.
Nightingale had in reality mistaken Jones's apartment for that in which himself had lodged; he therefore strongly insisted on coming in, often swearing that he would not be kept from his own bed. Jones, however, prevailed over him, and delivered him into the hands of Partridge, whom the noise on the stairs soon summoned to his master's assistance.
And now Jones was unwillingly obliged to return to his own apartment, where at the very instant of his entrance he heard Lady Bellaston venting an exclamation, though not a very loud one; and at the same time saw her flinging herself into a chair in a vast agitation, which in a lady of a tender constitution would have been an hysteric fit.
In reality the lady, frightened with the struggle between the two men, of which she did not know what would be the issue, as she heard Nightingale swear many oaths he would come to his own bed, attempted to retire to her known place of hiding, which to her great confusion she found already occupied by another.
"Is this usage to be borne, Mr Jones?" cries the lady.一"Basest of men?-----What wretch is this to whom you have exposed me?" "Wretch!"
cries Honour, bursting in a violent rage from her place of concealment一"Marry come up!-------Wretch forsooth?-----as poor a wretch as I
am, I am honest; this is more than some folks who are richer can say."
Jones, instead of applying himself directly to take off the edge of Mrs Honour's resentment, as a more experienced gallant would have done, fell to cursing his stars, and lamenting himself as the most unfortunate man in the world; and presently after, addressing himself to Lady Bella-ston, he fell to some very absurd protestations of innocence. By this time the lady, having recovered the use of her reason, which she had as ready as any woman in the world, especially on such occasions, calmly replied: "Sir, you need make no apologies, I see now who the person is; I did not at first know Mrs Honour: but now I do, I can suspect nothing wrong between her and you; and I am sure she is a woman of too good sense to put any wrong constructions upon my visit to you; I have been always her friend, and it may be in my power to be much more hereafter."
736
Mrs Honour was altogether as placable as she was passionate. Hearing, therefore, Lady Bellaston assume the soft tone, she likewise softened hers.----"I'm sure, madam," says she, "I have been always ready to ac-
knowledge your ladyship's friendships to me; sure I never had so good a friend as your ladyship----and to be sure, now I see it is your ladyship
that I spoke to, I could almost bite my tongue off for very mad.—I constructions upon your ladyship一to be sure it doth not become a servant as I am to think about such a great lady—I mean I was a servant: for indeed I am nobody's servant now, the more miserable wretch is me.一I have lost the best mistress——" Here Honour thought fit to produce a shower of tears.—"Don't cry, child," says the good lady; "ways perhaps may be found to make you amends. Come to me to-morrow morning." She then took up her fan which lay on the ground, and without even looking at Jones walked very majestically out of the room; there being a kind of dignity in the impudence of women of quality, which their inferiors vainly aspire to attain to in circumstances of this nature.
Jones followed her downstairs, often offering her his hand, which she absolutely refused him, and got into her chair without taking any notice of him as he stood bowing before her.
At his return upstairs, a long dialogue past between him and Mrs Honour, while she was adjusting herself after the discomposure she had undergone. The subject of this was his infidelity to her young lady; on which she enlarged with great bitterness; but Jones at last found means to reconcile her, and not only so, but to obtain a promise of most inviolable secrecy, and that she would the next morning endeavour to find out Sophia, and bring him a further account of the proceedings of the squire.
Thus ended this unfortunate adventure to the satisfaction only of Mrs Honour; for a secret (as some of my readers will perhaps acknowledge from experience) is often a very valuable possession: and that not only to those who faithfully keep it, but sometimes to such as whisper it about till it come to the ears of every one except the ignorant person who pays for the supposed concealing of what is publickly known.

Chapter V?
Short and sweet.
Notwithstanding all the obligations she had received from Jones, Mrs Miller could not forbear in the morning some gentle remonstrances for the hurricane which had happened the preceding night in his chamber. These were, however, so gentle and so friendly, professing, and indeed truly, to aim at nothing more than the real good of Mr Jones himself, that he, far from being offended, thankfully received the admonition of the good woman, expressed much concern for what had past, excused it as well as he could, and promised never more to bring the same disturbances into the house.
But though Mrs Miller did not refrain from a short expostulation in private at their first meeting, yet the occasion of his being summoned downstairs that morning was of a much more agreeable kind, being indeed to perform the office of a father to Miss Nancy, and to give her in wedlock to Mr Nightingale, who was now ready drest, and full as sober as many of my readers will think a man ought to be who receives a wife in so imprudent a manner.
And here perhaps it may be proper to account for the escape which this young gentleman had made from his uncle, and for his appearance in the condition in which we have seen him the night before.
Now when the uncle had arrived at his lodgings with his nephew, partly to indulge his own inclinations (for he dearly loved his bottle), and partly to disqualify his nephew from the immediate execution of his purpose, he ordered wine to be set on the table; with which he so briskly plyed the young gentleman, that this latter, who, though not much used to drinking, did not detest it so as to be guilty of disobedience or want of complacence by refusing, was soon completely finished.
Just as the uncle had obtained this victory, and was preparing a bed for his nephew, a messenger arrived with a piece of news, which so entirely disconcerted and shocked him, that he in a moment lost all
738
consideration for his nephew, and his whole mind became entirely taken up with his own concerns.
This sudden and afflicting news was no less than that his daughter had taken the opportunity of almost the first moment of his absence, and had gone off with a neighbouring young clergyman; against whom, though her father could have had but one objection, namely, that he was worth nothing, yet she had never thought proper to communicate her amour even to that father; and so artfully had she managed, that it had never been once suspected by any, till now that it was consummated.
Old Mr Nightingale no sooner received this account, than in the utmost confusion he ordered a post-chaise to be instantly got ready, and, having recommended his nephew to the care of a servant, he directly left the house, scarce knowing what he did, nor whither he went.
The uncle thus departed, when the servant came to attend the nephew to bed, had waked him for that purpose, and had at last made him sensible that his uncle was gone, he, instead of accepting the kind offices tendered him, insisted on a chair being called; with this the servant, who had received no strict orders to the contrary, readily complied; and, thus being conducted back to the house of Mrs Miller, he had staggered up to Mr Jones's chamber, as hath been before recounted.
This bar of the uncle being now removed (though young Nightingale knew not as yet in what manner), and all parties being quickly ready, the mother, Mr Jones, Mr Nightingale, and his love, stept into a hackneycoach, which conveyed them to Doctors' Commons; where Miss Nancy was, in vulgar language, soon made an honest woman, and the poor mother became, in the purest sense of the word, one of the happiest of all human beings.
And now Mr Jones, having seen his good offices to that poor woman and her family brought to a happy conclusion, began to apply himself to his own concerns; but here, lest many of my readers should censure his folly for thus troubling himself with the affairs of others, and lest some few should think he acted more disinterestedly than indeed he did, we think proper to assure our reader, that he was so far from being unconcerned in this matter, that he had indeed a very considerable interest in bringing it to that final consummation.
To explain this seeming paradox at once, he was one who could truly say with him in Terence, Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto. He was never an indifferent spectator of the misery or happiness of any one; and he felt either the one or the other in great proportion as he himself
739
contributed to either. He could not, therefore, be the instrument of raising a whole family from the lowest state of wretchedness to the highest pitch of joy without conveying great felicity to himself; more perhaps than worldly men often purchase to themselves by undergoing the most severe labour, and often by wading through the deepest iniquity.
Those readers who are of the same complexion with him will perhaps think this short chapter contains abundance of matter; while others may probably wish, short as it is, that it had been totally spared as impertinent to the main design, which I suppose they conclude is to bring Mr Jones to the gallows, or, if possible, to a more deplorable catastrophe.

Chapter J
Containing love-letters of several sorts.
Mr Jones, at his return home, found the following letters lying on his table, which he luckily opened in the order they were sent.
LETTER I.
"Surely I am under some strange infatuation; I cannot keep my resolutions a moment, however strongly made or justly founded. Last night I resolved never to see you more; this morning I am willing to hear if you can, as you say, clear up this affair. And yet I know that to be impossible. I have said everything to myself which you can invent.----Perhaps not.
Perhaps your invention is stronger. Come to me, therefore, the moment you receive this. If you can forge an excuse I almost promise you to believe it. Betrayed too----1 will think no more.-----Come to me directly.----------------------------------------------This is the third letter I have writ, the two former are
burnt-----1 am almost inclined to burn this too--1 wish I may preserve
my senses.-----Come to me presently."
LETTER II.
"If you ever expect to be forgiven, or even suffered within my doors, come to me this instant."
LETTER III.
"I now find you was not at home when my notes came to your lodgings. The moment you receive this let me see you;一I shall not stir out; nor shall anybody be let in but yourself. Sure nothing can detain you long."
Jones had just read over these three billets when Mr Nightingale came into the room. "Well, Tom," said he, "any news from Lady Bellaston, after last night's adventure?" (for it was now no secret to any one in that house who the lady was). "The Lady Bellaston?" answered Jones very gravely.----"Nay, dear Tom," cries Nightingale, "don't be so reserved to
your friends. Though I was too drunk to see her last night, I saw her at
741
the masquerade. Do you think I am ignorant who the queen of the fairies is?" "And did you really then know the lady at the masquerade?" said Jones. "Yes, upon my soul, did I," said Nightingale, "and have given you twenty hints of it since, though you seemed always so tender on that point, that I would not speak plainly. I fancy, my friend, by your extreme nicety in this matter, you are not so well acquainted with the character of the lady as with her person. Don't be angry, Tom, but upon my honour, you are not the first young fellow she hath debauched. Her reputation is in no danger, believe me."
Though Jones had no reason to imagine the lady to have been of the vestal kind when his amour began; yet, as he was thoroughly ignorant of the town, and had very little acquaintance in it, he had no knowledge of that character which is vulgarly called a demirep; that is to say, a woman who intrigues with every man she likes, under the name and appearance of virtue; and who, though some over-nice ladies will not be seen with her, is visited (as they term it) by the whole town, in short, whom everybody knows to be what nobody calls her.
When he found, therefore, that Nightingale was perfectly acquainted with his intrigue, and began to suspect that so scrupulous a delicacy as he had hitherto observed was not quite necessary on the occasion, he gave a latitude to his friend's tongue, and desired him to speak plainly what he knew, or had ever heard of the lady.
Nightingale, who, in many other instances, was rather too effeminate in his disposition, had a pretty strong inclination to tittle-tattle. He had no sooner, therefore, received a full liberty of speaking from Jones, than he entered upon a long narrative concerning the lady; which, as it contained many particulars highly to her dishonour, we have too great a tenderness for all women of condition to repeat. We would cautiously avoid giving an opportunity to the future commentators on our works, of making any malicious application and of forcing us to be, against our will, the author of scandal, which never entered into our head.
Jones, having very attentively heard all that Nightingale had to say, fetched a deep sigh; which the other, observing, cried, "Heyday! why, thou art not in love, I hope! Had I imagined my stories would have affected you, I promise you should never have heard them." "O my dear friend!" cries Jones, "I am so entangled with this woman, that I know not how to extricate myself. In love, indeed! no, my friend, but I am under obligations to her, and very great ones. Since you know so much, I will be very explicit with you. It is owing, perhaps, solely to her, that I have
742
not, before this, wanted a bit of bread. How can I possibly desert such a woman? and yet I must desert her, or be guilty of the blackest treachery to one who deserves infinitely better of me than she can; a woman, my Nightingale, for whom I have a passion which few can have an idea of. I am half distracted with doubts how to act." "And is this other, pray, an honourable mistress?" cries Nightingale. "Honourable!" answered Jones; "no breath ever yet durst sully her reputation. The sweetest air is not purer, the limpid stream not clearer, than her honour. She is all over, both in mind and body, consummate perfection. She is the most beautiful creature in the universe: and yet she is mistress of such noble elevated qualities, that, though she is never from my thoughts, I scarce ever think of her beauty but when I see it."一"And can you, my good friend," cries Nightingale, "with such an engagement as this upon your hands, hesitate a moment about quitting such a—" "Hold," said Jones, "no more abuse of her: I detest the thought of ingratitude." "Pooh!" answered the other, "you are not the first upon whom she hath conferred obligations of this kind. She is remarkably liberal where she likes; though, let me tell you, her favours are so prudently bestowed, that they should rather raise a man's vanity than his gratitude." In short, Nightingale proceeded so far on this head, and told his friend so many stories of the lady, which he swore to the truth of, that he entirely removed all esteem for her from the breast of Jones; and his gratitude was lessened in proportion. Indeed, he began to look on all the favours he had received rather as wages than benefits, which depreciated not only her, but himself too in his own conceit, and put him quite out of humour with both. From this disgust, his mind, by a natural transition, turned towards Sophia; her virtue, her purity, her love to him, her sufferings on his account, filled all his thoughts, and made his commerce with Lady Bellaston appear still more odious. The result of all was, that, though his turning himself out of her service, in which light he now saw his affair with her, would be the loss of his bread; yet he determined to quit her, if he could but find a handsome pretence: which being communicated to his friend, Nightingale considered a little, and then said, "I have it, my boy! I have found out a sure method; propose marriage to her, and I would venture hanging upon the success." "Marriage?" cries Jones. "Ay, propose marriage," answered Nightingale, "and she will declare off in a moment. I knew a young fellow whom she kept formerly, who made the offer to her in earnest, and was presently turned off for his pains."
Jones declared he could not venture the experiment. "Perhaps," said he, "she may be less shocked at this proposal from one man than from
743
another. And if she should take me at my word, where am I then? caught, in my own trap, and undone for ever." "No;" answered Nightingale, "not if I can give you an expedient by which you may at any time get out of the trap."----"What expedient can that be?" replied Jones.
"This," answered Nightingale. "The young fellow I mentioned, who is one of the most intimate acquaintances I have in the world, is so angry with her for some ill offices she hath since done him, that I am sure he would, without any difficulty, give you a sight of her letters; upon which you may decently break with her; and declare off before the knot is tyed, if she should really be willing to tie it, which I am convinced she will not."
After some hesitation, Jones, upon the strength of this assurance, consented; but, as he swore he wanted the confidence to propose the matter to her face, he wrote the following letter, which Nightingale dictated:一
"MADAM,
"I am extremely concerned, that, by an unfortunate engagement abroad, I should have missed receiving the honour of your ladyship's commands the moment they came; and the delay which I must now suffer of vindicating myself to your ladyship greatly adds to this misfortune. O, Lady Bellaston! what a terror have I been in for fear your reputation should be exposed by these perverse accidents! There is one only way to secure it. I need not name what that is. Only permit me to say, that as your honour is as dear to me as my own, so my sole ambition is to have the glory of laying my liberty at your feet; and believe me when I assure you, I can never be made completely happy without you generously bestow on me a legal right of calling you mine for ever.一I am,
madam, with most profound respect, your ladyship's most obliged, obedient, humble servant, THOMAS JONES."
To this she presently returned the following answer:
"SIR,
"When I read over your serious epistle, I could, from its coldness and formality, have sworn that you already had the legal right you mention; nay, that we had for many years composed that monstrous animal a husband and wife. Do you really then imagine me a fool? or do you fancy yourself capable of so entirely persuading me out of my senses, that I should deliver my whole fortune into your power, in order to enable you to support your pleasures at my expense? Are these the proofs of love which I expected? Is this the return for一? but I scorn to upbraid you, and am in great admiration of your profound respect.
744
"P.S. I am prevented from revising:----Perhaps I have said more than
I meant.----Come to me at eight this evening."
Jones, by the advice of his privy-council, replied:
"MADAM,
"It is impossible to express how much I am shocked at the suspicion you entertain of me. Can Lady Bellaston have conferred favours on a man whom she could believe capable of so base a design? or can she treat the most solemn tie of love with contempt? Can you imagine, madam, that if the violence of my passion, in an unguarded moment, overcame the tenderness which I have for your honour, I would think of indulging myself in the continuance of an intercourse which could not possibly escape long the notice of the world; and which, when discovered, must prove so fatal to your reputation? If such be your opinion of me, I must pray for a sudden opportunity of returning those pecuniary obligations, which I have been so unfortunate to receive at your hands; and for those of a more tender kind, I shall ever remain, &amp;c." And so concluded in the very words with which he had concluded the former letter.
The lady answered as follows:
"I see you are a villain! and I despise you from my soul. If you come here I shall not be at home."
Though Jones was well satisfied with his deliverance from a thraldom which those who have ever experienced it will, I apprehend, allow to be none of the lightest, he was not, however, perfectly easy in his mind. There was in this scheme too much of fallacy to satisfy one who utterly detested every species of falshood or dishonesty: nor would he, indeed, have submitted to put it in practice, had he not been involved in a distressful situation, where he was obliged to be guilty of some dishonour, either to the one lady or the other; and surely the reader will allow, that every good principle, as well as love, pleaded strongly in favour of Sophia.
Nightingale highly exulted in the success of his stratagem, upon which he received many thanks and much applause from his friend. He answered, "Dear Tom, we have conferred very different obligations on each other. To me you owe the regaining your liberty; to you I owe the loss of mine. But if you are as happy in the one instance as I am in the other, I promise you we are the two happiest fellows in England."
745
The two gentlemen were now summoned down to dinner, where Mrs Miller, who performed herself the office of cook, had exerted her best talents to celebrate the wedding of her daughter. This joyful circumstance she ascribed principally to the friendly behaviour of Jones, her whole soul was fired with gratitude towards him, and all her looks, words, and actions, were so busied in expressing it, that her daughter, and even her new son-in-law, were very little objects of her consideration.
Dinner was just ended when Mrs Miller received a letter; but as we have had letters enow in this chapter, we shall communicate its contents in our next.
746
10
Chapter A Vx
Consisting partly of facts, and partly of observations upon them.
The letter then which arrived at the end of the preceding chapter was from Mr Allworthy, and the purport of it was, his intention to come immediately to town, with his nephew Blifil, and a desire to be accommodated with his usual lodgings, which were the first floor for himself, and the second for his nephew.
The chearfulness which had before displayed itself in the countenance of the poor woman was a little clouded on this occasion. This news did indeed a good deal disconcert her. To requite so disinterested a match with her daughter, by presently turning her new son-in-law out of doors, appeared to her very unjustifiable on the one hand; and on the other, she could scarce bear the thoughts of making any excuse to Mr Allworthy, after all the obligations received from him, for depriving him of lodgings which were indeed strictly his due; for that gentleman, in conferring all his numberless benefits on others, acted by a rule diametrically opposite to what is practised by most generous people. He contrived, on all occasions, to hide his beneficence, not only from the world, but even from the object of it. He constantly used the words Lend and Pay, instead of Give; and by every other method he could invent, always lessened with his tongue the favours he conferred, while he was heaping them with both his hands. When he settled the annuity of £50 a year therefore on Mrs Miller, he told her, "it was in consideration of always having her first-floor when he was in town (which he scarce ever intended to be), but that she might let it at any other time, for that he would always send her a month's warning." He was now, however, hurried to town so suddenly, that he had no opportunity of giving such notice; and this hurry probably prevented him, when he wrote for his lodgings, adding, if they were then empty; for he would most certainly have been well satisfied to have relinquished them, on a less sufficient excuse than what Mrs Miller could now have made.
747
But there are a sort of persons, who, as Prior excellently well remarks, direct their conduct by something
Beyond the fix'd and settled rules Of vice and virtue in the schools, Beyond the letter of the law.
To these it is so far from being sufficient that their defence would acquit them at the Old Bailey, that they are not even contented, though conscience, the severest of all judges, should discharge them. Nothing short of the fair and honourable will satisfy the delicacy of their minds; and if any of their actions fall short of this mark, they mope and pine, are as uneasy and restless as a murderer, who is afraid of a ghost, or of the hangman.
Mrs Miller was one of these. She could not conceal her uneasiness at this letter; with the contents of which she had no sooner acquainted the company, and given some hints of her distress, than Jones, her good angel, presently relieved her anxiety. "As for myself, madam," said he, "my lodging is at your service at a moment's warning; and Mr Nightingale, I am sure, as he cannot yet prepare a house fit to receive his lady, will consent to return to his new lodging, whither Mrs Nightingale will certainly consent to go." With which proposal both husband and wife instantly agreed.
The reader will easily believe, that the cheeks of Mrs Miller began again to glow with additional gratitude to Jones; but, perhaps, it may be more difficult to persuade him, that Mr Jones having in his last speech called her daughter Mrs Nightingale (it being the first time that agreeable sound had ever reached her ears), gave the fond mother more satisfaction, and warmed her heart more towards Jones, than his having dissipated her present anxiety.
The next day was then appointed for the removal of the new-married couple, and of Mr Jones, who was likewise to be provided for in the same house with his friend. And now the serenity of the company was again restored, and they past the day in the utmost chearfulness, all except Jones, who, though he outwardly accompanied the rest in their mirth, felt many a bitter pang on the account of his Sophia, which were not a little heightened by the news of Mr Blifil's coming to town (for he clearly saw the intention of his journey); and what greatly aggravated his concern was, that Mrs Honour, who had promised to inquire after Sophia, and to make her report to him early the next evening, had disappointed him.
748
In the situation that he and his mistress were in at this time, there were scarce any grounds for him to hope that he should hear any good news; yet he was as impatient to see Mrs Honour as if he had expected she would bring him a letter with an assignation in it from Sophia, and bore the disappointment as ill. Whether this impatience arose from that natural weakness of the human mind, which makes it desirous to know the worst, and renders uncertainty the most intolerable of pains; or whether he still flattered himself with some secret hopes, we will not determine. But that it might be the last, whoever has loved cannot but know. For of all the powers exercised by this passion over our minds, one of the most wonderful is that of supporting hope in the midst of despair. Difficulties, improbabilities, nay, impossibilities, are quite overlooked by it; so that to any man extremely in love, may be applied what Addison says of Caesar,
"The Alps, and Pyrenaeans, sink before him!"
Yet it is equally true, that the same passion will sometimes make mountains of molehills, and produce despair in the midst of hope; but these cold fits last not long in good constitutions. Which temper Jones was now in, we leave the reader to guess, having no exact information about it; but this is certain, that he had spent two hours in expectation, when, being unable any longer to conceal his uneasiness, he retired to his room; where his anxiety had almost made him frantick, when the following letter was brought him from Mrs Honour, with which we shall present the reader verbatim et literatim.
"SIR,

"HONOUR BLACKMORE."
Various were the conjectures which Jones entertained on this step of Lady Bellaston; who, in reality, had little farther design than to secure within her own house the repository of a secret, which she chose should make no farther progress than it had made already; but mostly, she desired to keep it from the ears of Sophia; for though that young lady was almost the only one who would never have repeated it again, her ladyship could not persuade herself of this; since, as she now hated poor Sophia with most implacable hatred, she conceived a reciprocal hatred to herself to be lodged in the tender breast of our heroine, where no such passion had ever yet found an entrance.
While Jones was terrifying himself with the apprehension of a thousand dreadful machinations, and deep political designs, which he imagined to be at the bottom of the promotion of Honour, Fortune, who hitherto seems to have been an utter enemy to his match with Sophia, tried a new method to put a final end to it, by throwing a temptation in his way, which in his present desperate situation it seemed unlikely he should be able to resist.

Containing curious, but not unprecedented matter.
There was a lady, one Mrs Hunt, who had often seen Jones at the house where he lodged, being intimately acquainted with the women there, and indeed a very great friend to Mrs Miller. Her age was about thirty, for she owned six-and-twenty; her face and person very good, only inclining a little too much to be fat. She had been married young by her relations to an old Turkey merchant, who, having got a great fortune, had left off trade. With him she lived without reproach, but not without pain, in a state of great self-denial, for about twelve years; and her virtue was rewarded by his dying and leaving her very rich. The first year of her widowhood was just at an end, and she had past it in a good deal of retirement, seeing only a few particular friends, and dividing her time between her devotions and novels, of which she was always extremely fond. Very good health, a very warm constitution, and a good deal of religion, made it absolutely necessary for her to marry again; and she resolved to please herself in her second husband, as she had done her friends in the first. From her the following billet was brought to Jones:一
"SIR,
"From the first day I saw you, I doubt my eyes have told you too plainly that you were not indifferent to me; but neither my tongue nor my hand should have ever avowed it, had not the ladies of the family where you are lodged given me such a character of you, and told me such proofs of your virtue and goodness, as convince me you are not only the most agreeable, but the most worthy of men. I have also the satisfaction to hear from them, that neither my person, understanding, or character, are disagreeable to you. I have a fortune sufficient to make us both happy, but which cannot make me so without you. In thus disposing of myself, I know I shall incur the censure of the world; but if I did not love you more than I fear the world, I should not be worthy of you. One only difficulty stops me: I am informed you are engaged in a commerce of gallantry with a woman of fashion. If you think it worth while
751
to sacrifice that to the possession of me, I am yours; if not, forget my weakness, and let this remain an eternal secret between you and
"ARABELLA HUNT."
At the reading of this, Jones was put into a violent flutter. His fortune was then at a very low ebb, the source being stopt from which hitherto he had been supplied. Of all he had received from Lady Bellaston, not above five guineas remained; and that very morning he had been dunned by a tradesman for twice that sum. His honourable mistress was in the hands of her father, and he had scarce any hopes ever to get her out of them again. To be subsisted at her expense, from that little fortune she had independent of her father, went much against the delicacy both of his pride and his love. This lady's fortune would have been exceeding convenient to him, and he could have no objection to her in any respect. On the contrary, he liked her as well as he did any woman except Sophia. But to abandon Sophia, and marry another, that was impossible; he could not think of it upon any account, Yet why should he not, since it was plain she could not be his? Would it not be kinder to her, than to continue her longer engaged in a hopeless passion for him? Ought he not to do so in friendship to her? This notion prevailed some moments, and he had almost determined to be false to her from a high point of honour: but that refinement was not able to stand very long against the voice of nature, which cried in his heart that such friendship was treason to love. At last he called for pen, ink, and paper, and writ as follows to Mrs Hunt:—
"MADAM,
"It would be but a poor return to the favour you have done me to sacrifice any gallantry to the possession of you, and I would certainly do it, though I were not disengaged, as at present I am, from any affair of that kind. But I should not be the honest man you think me, if I did not tell you that my affections are engaged to another, who is a woman of virtue, and one that I never can leave, though it is probable I shall never possess her. God forbid that, in return of your kindness to me, I should do you such an injury as to give you my hand when I cannot give my heart. No; I had much rather starve than be guilty of that. Even though my mistress were married to another, I would not marry you unless my heart had entirely effaced all impressions of her. Be assured that your secret was not more safe in your own breast, than in that of your most obliged, and grateful humble servant,
"T. JONES."
752
When our heroe had finished and sent this letter, he went to his scrutore, took out Miss Western's muff, kissed it several times, and then strutted some turns about his room, with more satisfaction of mind than ever any Irishman felt in carrying off a fortune of fifty thousand pounds.

A discovery made by Partridge.
While Jones was exulting in the consciousness of his integrity, Partridge came capering into the room, as was his custom when he brought, or fancied he brought, any good tidings. He had been despatched that morning by his master, with orders to endeavour, by the servants of Lady Bellaston, or by any other means, to discover whither Sophia had been conveyed; and he now returned, and with a joyful countenance told our heroe that he had found the lost bird. "I have seen, sir," says he, "Black George, the gamekeeper, who is one of the servants whom the squire hath brought with him to town. I knew him presently, though I have not seen him these several years; but you know, sir, he is a very remarkable man, or, to use a purer phrase, he hath a most remarkable beard, the largest and blackest I ever saw. It was some time, however, before Black George could recollect me." "Well, but what is your good news?" cries Jones; "what do you know of my Sophia?" "You shall know presently, sir," answered Partridge, "I am coming to it as fast as I can. You are so impatient, sir, you would come at the infinitive mood before you can get to the imperative. As I was saying, sir, it was some time before he recollected my face."一"Confound your face!" cries Jones, "what of my Sophia?" "Nay, sir," answered Partridge, "I know nothing more of Madam Sophia than what I am going to tell you; and I should have told you all before this if you had not interrupted me; but if you look so angry at me you will frighten all of it out of my head, or, to use a purer phrase, out of my memory. I never saw you look so angry since the day we left Upton, which I shall remember if I was to live a thousand years."一"Well, pray go on your own way," said Jones: "you are resolved to make me mad I find." "Not for the world," answered Partridge, "I have suffered enough for that already; which, as I said, I shall bear in my remembrance the longest day I have to live." "Well, but Black George?" cries Jones. "Well, sir, as I was saying, it was a long time before he could recollect me; for, indeed, I am very much altered since I saw him. Non
754
sum qualis eram. I have had troubles in the world, and nothing alters a man so much as grief. I have heard it will change the colour of a man's hair in a night. However, at last, know me he did, that's sure enough; for we are both of an age, and were at the same charity school. George was a great dunce, but no matter for that; all men do not thrive in the world according to their learning. I am sure I have reason to say so; but it will be all one a thousand years hence. Well, sir, where was I?一O一well, we no sooner knew each other, than, after many hearty shakes by the hand, we agreed to go to an alehouse and take a pot, and by good luck the beer was some of the best I have met with since I have been in town. Now, sir, I am coming to the point; for no sooner did I name you, and told him that you and I came to town together, and had lived together ever since, than he called for another pot, and swore he would drink to your health; and indeed he drank your health so heartily that I was overjoyed to see there was so much gratitude left in the world; and after we had emptied that pot I said I would buy my pot too, and so we drank another to your health; and then I made haste home to tell you the news."
"What news?" cries Jones, "you have not mentioned a word of my Sophia!" "Bless me! I had like to have forgot that. Indeed, we mentioned a great deal about young Madam Western, and George told me all; that Mr Blifil is coming to town in order to be married to her. He had best make haste then, says I, or somebody will have her before he comes; and, indeed, says I, Mr Seagrim, it is a thousand pities somebody should not have her; for he certainly loves her above all the women in the world. I would have both you and she know, that it is not for her fortune he follows her; for I can assure you, as to matter of that, there is another lady, one of much greater quality and fortune than she can pretend to, who is so fond of somebody that she comes after him day and night."
Here Jones fell into a passion with Partridge, for having, as he said, betrayed him; but the poor fellow answered, he had mentioned no name: "Besides, sir," said he, "I can assure you George is sincerely your friend, and wished Mr Blifil at the devil more than once; nay, he said he would do anything in his power upon earth to serve you; and so I am convinced he will. Betray you, indeed! why, I question whether you have a better friend than George upon earth, except myself, or one that would go farther to serve you."
"Well," says Jones, a little pacified, "you say this fellow, who, I believe, indeed, is enough inclined to be my friend, lives in the same house with Sophia?"
755
"In the same house!" answered Partridge; "why, sir, he is one of the servants of the family, and very well drest I promise you he is; if it was not for his black beard you would hardly know him."
"One service then at least he may do me," says Jones: "sure he can certainly convey a letter to my Sophia."
"You have hit the nail ad unguem" cries Partridge; "how came I not to think of it? I will engage he shall do it upon the very first mentioning."
"Well, then," said Jones, "do you leave me at present, and I will write a letter, which you shall deliver to him to-morrow morning; for I suppose you know where to find him."
"O yes, sir," answered Partridge, "I shall certainly find him again; there is no fear of that. The liquor is too good for him to stay away long. I make no doubt but he will be there every day he stays in town."
"So you don't know the street then where my Sophia is lodged?" cries Jones.
"Indeed, sir, I do," says Partridge.
"What is the name of the street?" cries Jones.
"The name, sir? why, here, sir, just by," answered Partridge, "not above a street or two off. I don't, indeed, know the very name; for, as he never told me, if I had asked, you know, it might have put some suspicion into his head. No, no, sir, let me alone for that. I am too cunning for that, I promise you."
"Thou art most wonderfully cunning, indeed," replied Jones; "however, I will write to my charmer, since I believe you will be cunning enough to find him to-morrow at the alehouse."
And now, having dismissed the sagacious Partridge, Mr Jones sat himself down to write, in which employment we shall leave him for a time. And here we put an end to the fifteenth book.

Chapter 且
Of prologues.
I have heard of a dramatic writer who used to say, he would rather write a play than a prologue; in like manner, I think, I can with less pains write one of the books of this history than the prefatory chapter to each of them.
To say the truth, I believe many a hearty curse hath been devoted on the head of that author who first instituted the method of prefixing to his play that portion of matter which is called the prologue; and which at first was part of the piece itself, but of latter years hath had usually so little connexion with the drama before which it stands, that the prologue to one play might as well serve for any other. Those indeed of more modern date, seem all to be written on the same three topics, viz., an abuse of the taste of the town, a condemnation of all contemporary authors, and an eulogium on the performance just about to be represented. The sentiments in all these are very little varied, nor is it possible they should; and indeed I have often wondered at the great invention of authors, who have been capable of finding such various phrases to express the same thing.
In like manner I apprehend, some future historian (if any one shall do me the honour of imitating my manner) will, after much scratching his pate, bestow some good wishes on my memory, for having first established these several initial chapters; most of which, like modern prologues, may as properly be prefixed to any other book in this history as to that which they introduce, or indeed to any other history as to this.
But however authors may suffer by either of these inventions, the reader will find sufficient emolument in the one as the spectator hath long found in the other.
First, it is well known that the prologue serves the critic for an opportunity to try his faculty of hissing, and to tune his cat-call to the best advantage; by which means, I have known those musical instruments so
758
well prepared, that they have been able to play in full concert at the first rising of the curtain.
The same advantages may be drawn from these chapters, in which the critic will be always sure of meeting with something that may serve as a whetstone to his noble spirit; so that he may fall with a more hungry appetite for censure on the history itself. And here his sagacity must make it needless to observe how artfully these chapters are calculated for that excellent purpose; for in these we have always taken care to intersperse somewhat of the sour or acid kind, in order to sharpen and stimulate the said spirit of criticism.
Again, the indolent reader, as well as spectator, finds great advantage from both these; for, as they are not obliged either to see the one or read the others, and both the play and the book are thus protracted, by the former they have a quarter of an hour longer allowed them to sit at dinner, and by the latter they have the advantage of beginning to read at the fourth or fifth page instead of the first, a matter by no means of trivial consequence to persons who read books with no other view than to say they have read them, a more general motive to reading than is commonly imagined; and from which not only law books, and good books, but the pages of Homer and Virgil, of Swift and Cervantes, have been often turned over.
Many other are the emoluments which arise from both these, but they are for the most part so obvious, that we shall not at present stay to enumerate them; especially since it occurs to us that the principal merit of both the prologue and the preface is that they be short.

Chapter
A whimsical adventure which befel the squire, with the distressed situation of Sophia.
We must now convey the reader to Mr Western's lodgings, which were in Piccadilly, where he was placed by the recommendation of the landlord at the Hercules Pillars at Hyde Park Corner; for at the inn, which was the first he saw on his arrival in town, he placed his horses, and in those lodgings, which were the first he heard of, he deposited himself.
Here, when Sophia alighted from the hackney-coach, which brought her from the house of Lady Bellaston, she desired to retire to the apartment provided for her; to which her father very readily agreed, and whither he attended her himself. A short dialogue, neither very material nor pleasant to relate minutely, then passed between them, in which he pressed her vehemently to give her consent to the marriage with Blifil, who, as he acquainted her, was to be in town in a few days; but, instead of complying, she gave a more peremptory and resolute refusal than she had ever done before. This so incensed her father, that after many bitter vows, that he would force her to have him whether she would or no, he departed from her with many hard words and curses, locked the door, and put the key into his pocket.
While Sophia was left with no other company than what attend the closest state prisoner, namely, fire and candle, the squire sat down to regale himself over a bottle of wine, with his parson and the landlord of the Hercules Pillars, who, as the squire said, would make an excellent third man, and could inform them of the news of the town, and how affairs went; for to be sure, says he, he knows a great deal, since the horses of many of the quality stand at his house.
In this agreeable society Mr Western past that evening and great part of the succeeding day, during which period nothing happened of sufficient consequence to find a place in this history. All this time Sophia past
760
by herself; for her father swore she should never come out of her chamber alive, unless she first consented to marry Blifil; nor did he ever suffer the door to be unlocked, unless to convey her food, on which occasions he always attended himself.
The second morning after his arrival, while he and the parson were at breakfast together on a toast and tankard, he was informed that a gentleman was below to wait on him.
"A gentleman!" quoth the squire, "who the devil can he be? Do, doctor, go down and see who 'tis. Mr Blifil can hardly be come to town yet.一Go down, do, and know what his business is."
The doctor returned with an account that it was a very well-drest man, and by the ribbon in his hat he took him for an officer of the army; that he said he had some particular business, which he could deliver to none but Mr Western himself.
"An officer!" cries the squire; "what can any such fellow have to do with me? If he wants an order for baggage-waggons, I am no justice of peace here, nor can I grant a warrant.一Let un come up then, if he must speak to me."
A very genteel man now entered the room; who, having made his compliments to the squire, and desired the favour of being alone with him, delivered himself as follows:一
"Sir, I come to wait upon you by the command of my Lord Fellamar; but with a very different message from what I suppose you expect, after what past the other night."
"My lord who?" cries the squire; "I never heard the name o'un."
"His lordship," said the gentleman, "is willing to impute everything to the effect of liquor, and the most trifling acknowledgment of that kind will set everything right; for as he hath the most violent attachment to your daughter, you, sir, are the last person upon earth from whom he would resent an affront; and happy is it for you both that he hath given such public demonstrations of his courage as to be able to put up an affair of this kind without danger of any imputation on his honour. All he desires, therefore, is, that you will before me make some acknowledgment; the slightest in the world will be sufficient; and he intends this afternoon to pay his respects to you, in order to obtain your leave of visiting the young lady on the footing of a lover."
"I don't understand much of what you say, sir," said the squire; "but I suppose, by what you talk about my daughter, that this is the lord which
761
my cousin, Lady Bellaston, mentioned to me, and said something about his courting my daughter. If so be that how that be the case一you may give my service to his lordship, and tell un the girl is disposed of already."
"Perhaps, sir," said the gentleman, "you are not sufficiently apprized of the greatness of this offer. I believe such a person, title, and fortune would be nowhere refused."
"Lookee, sir," answered the squire; "to be very plain, my daughter is bespoke already; but if she was not, I would not marry her to a lord upon any account; I hate all lords; they are a parcel of courtiers and Hanoverians, and I will have nothing to do with them."
"Well, sir," said the gentleman, "if that is your resolution, the message I am to deliver to you is that my lord desires the favour of your company this morning in Hyde Park."
"You may tell my lord," answered the squire, "that I am busy and cannot come. I have enough to look after at home, and can't stir abroad on any account."
"I am sure, sir," quoth the other, "you are too much a gentleman to send such a message; you will not, I am convinced, have it said of you, that, after having affronted a noble peer, you refuse him satisfaction. His lordship would have been willing, from his great regard to the young lady, to have made up matters in another way; but unless he is to look on you as a father, his honour will not suffer his putting up such an indignity as you must be sensible you offered him."
"I offered him!" cries the squire; "it is a d—n'd lie! I never offered him anything."
Upon these words the gentleman returned a very short verbal rebuke, and this he accompanied at the same time with some manual remonstrances, which no sooner reached the ears of Mr Western, than that worthy squire began to caper very briskly about the room, bellowing at the same time with all his might, as if desirous to summon a greater number of spectators to behold his agility.
The parson, who had left great part of the tankard unfinished, was not retired far; he immediately attended therefore on the squire's vociferation, crying, "Bless me! sir, what's the matter?"一"Matter!" quoth the squire, "here's a highwayman, I believe, who wants to rob and murder me—for he hath fallen upon me with that stick there in his hand, when I wish I may be d—n'd if I gid un the least provocation."
762
"How, sir," said the captain, "did you not tell me I lyed?"
"No, as I hope to be saved," answered the squire, "一I believe I might say, 'Twas a lie that I had offered any affront to my lord一but I never said the word, 'you lie.'一I understand myself better, and you might have understood yourself better than to fall upon a naked man. If I had a stick in my hand, you would not have dared strike me. I'd have knocked thy lantern jaws about thy ears. Come down into yard this minute, and I'll take a bout with thee at single stick for a broken head, that I will; or I will go into naked room and box thee for a belly-full. At unt half a man, at unt, I'm sure."
The captain, with some indignation, replied, "I see, sir, you are below my notice, and I shall inform his lordship you are below his. I am sorry I have dirtied my fingers with you." At which words he withdrew, the parson interposing to prevent the squire from stopping him, in which he easily prevailed, as the other, though he made some efforts for the purpose, did not seem very violently bent on success. However, when the captain was departed, the squire sent many curses and some menaces after him; but as these did not set out from his lips till the officer was at the bottom of the stairs, and grew louder and louder as he was more and more remote, they did not reach his ears, or at least did not retard his departure.
Poor Sophia, however, who, in her prison, heard all her father's outcries from first to last, began now first to thunder with her foot, and afterwards to scream as loudly as the old gentleman himself had done before, though in a much sweeter voice. These screams soon silenced the squire, and turned all his consideration towards his daughter, whom he loved so tenderly, that the least apprehension of any harm happening to her, threw him presently into agonies; for, except in that single instance in which the whole future happiness of her life was concerned, she was sovereign mistress of his inclinations.
Having ended his rage against the captain, with swearing he would take the law of him, the squire now mounted upstairs to Sophia, whom, as soon as he had unlocked and opened the door, he found all pale and breathless. The moment, however, that she saw her father, she collected all her spirits, and, catching him hold by the hand, she cryed passionately, "O my dear sir, I am almost frightened to death! I hope to heaven no harm hath happened to you." "No, no," cries the squire, "no great harm. The rascal hath not hurt me much, but rat me if I don't ha the la o' un." "Pray, dear sir," says she, "tell me what's the matter; who is it that
763
hath insulted you?" "I don't know the name o' un," answered Western; "some officer fellow, I suppose, that we are to pay for beating us; but I'll make him pay this bout, if the rascal hath got anything, which I suppose he hath not. For thof he was drest out so vine, I question whether he had got a voot of land in the world." "But, dear sir," cries she, "what was the occasion of your quarrel?" "What should it be, Sophy," answered the squire, "but about you, Sophy? All my misfortunes are about you; you will be the death of your poor father at last. Here's a varlet of a lord, the Lord knows who, forsooth! who hath a taan a liking to you, and because I would not gi un my consent, he sent me a kallenge. Come, do be a good girl, Sophy, and put an end to all your father's troubles; come, do consent to ha un; he will be in town within this day or two; do but promise me to marry un as soon as he comes, and you will make me the happiest man in the world, and I will make you the happiest woman; you shall have the finest cloaths in London, and the finest jewels, and a coach and six at your command. I promised Allworthy already to give up half my es-tate一od rabbet it! I should hardly stick at giving up the whole." "Will my papa be so kind," says she, "as to hear me speak?"一"Why wout ask, Sophy?" cries he, "when dost know I had rather hear thy voice than the musick of the best pack of dogs in England.一Hear thee, my dear little girl! I hope I shall hear thee as long as I live; for if I was ever to lose that pleasure, I would not gee a brass varden to live a moment longer. Indeed, Sophy, you do not know how I love you, indeed you don't, or you never could have run away and left your poor father, who hath no other joy, no other comfort upon earth, but his little Sophy." At these words the tears stood in his eyes; and Sophia (with the tears streaming from hers) answered, "Indeed, my dear papa, I know you have loved me tenderly, and heaven is my witness how sincerely I have returned your affection; nor could anything but an apprehension of being forced into the arms of this man have driven me to run from a father whom I love so passionately, that I would, with pleasure, sacrifice my life to his happiness; nay, I have endeavoured to reason myself into doing more, and had almost worked up a resolution to endure the most miserable of all lives, to comply with your inclination. It was that resolution alone to which I could not force my mind; nor can I ever." Here the squire began to look wild, and the foam appeared at his lips, which Sophia, observing, begged to be heard out, and then proceeded: "If my father's life, his health, or any real happiness of his was at stake, here stands your resolved daughter; may heaven blast me if there is a misery I would not suffer to preserve you!一No, that most detested, most loathsome of all
764
lots would I embrace. I would give my hand to Blifil for your sake."一"I tell thee, it will preserve me," answers the father; "it will give me health, happiness, life, everything.一Upon my soul I shall die if dost refuse me; I shall break my heart, I shall, upon my soul."一"Is it possible," says she, "you can have such a desire to make me miserable?"一"I tell thee noa," answered he loudly, "d一n me if there is a thing upon earth I would not do to see thee happy."一"And will not my dear papa allow me to have the least knowledge of what will make me so? If it be true that happiness consists in opinion, what must be my condition, when I shall think myself the most miserable of all the wretches upon earth?" "Better think yourself so," said he, "than know it by being married to a poor bastardly vagabond." "If it will content you, sir," said Sophia, "I will give you the most solemn promise never to marry him, nor any other, while my papa lives, without his consent. Let me dedicate my whole life to your service; let me be again your poor Sophy, and my whole business and pleasure be, as it hath been, to please and divert you." "Lookee, Sophy," answered the squire, "I am not to be choused in this manner. Your aunt Western would then have reason to think me the fool she doth. No, no, Sophy, I'd have you to know I have a got more wisdom, and know more of the world, than to take the word of a woman in a matter where a man is concerned." "How, sir, have I deserved this want of confidence?" said she; "have I ever broke a single promise to you? or have I ever been found guilty of a falsehood from my cradle?" "Lookee, Sophy," cries he; "that's neither here nor there. I am determined upon this match, and have him you shall, d一n me if shat unt. D一n me if shat unt, though dost hang thyself the next morning." At repeating which words he clinched his fist, knit his brows, bit his lips, and thundered so loud, that the poor afflicted, terrified Sophia sunk trembling into her chair, and, had not a flood of tears come immediately to her relief, perhaps worse had followed.
Western beheld the deplorable condition of his daughter with no more contrition or remorse than the turnkey of Newgate feels at viewing the agonies of a tender wife, when taking her last farewel of her condemned husband; or rather he looked down on her with the same emotions which arise in an honest fair tradesman, who sees his debtor dragged to prison for £10, which, though a just debt, the wretch is wickedly unable to pay. Or, to hit the case still more nearly, he felt the same compunction with a bawd, when some poor innocent, whom she hath ensnared into her hands, falls into fits at the first proposal of what is called seeing company. Indeed this resemblance would be exact, was it not that the bawd hath an interest in what she doth, and the father, though perhaps he may
765
blindly think otherwise, can, in reality, have none in urging his daughter to almost an equal prostitution.
In this condition he left his poor Sophia, and, departing with a very vulgar observation on the effect of tears, he locked the room, and returned to the parson, who said everything he durst in behalf of the young lady, which, though perhaps it was not quite so much as his duty required, yet was it sufficient to throw the squire into a violent rage, and into many indecent reflections on the whole body of the clergy, which we have too great an honour for that sacred function to commit to paper.

Chapter U
What happened to Sophia during her confinement.
The landlady of the house where the squire lodged had begun very early to entertain a strange opinion of her guests. However, as she was informed that the squire was a man of vast fortune, and as she had taken care to exact a very extraordinary price for her rooms, she did not think proper to give any offence; for, though she was not without some concern for the confinement of poor Sophia, of whose great sweetness of temper and affability the maid of the house had made so favourable a report, which was confirmed by all the squire's servants, yet she had much more concern for her own interest than to provoke one, whom, as she said, she perceived to be a very hastish kind of a gentleman.
Though Sophia eat but little, yet she was regularly served with her meals; indeed, I believe, if she had liked any one rarity, that the squire, however angry, would have spared neither pains nor cost to have procured it for her; since, however strange it may appear to some of my readers, he really doated on his daughter, and to give her any kind of pleasure was the highest satisfaction of his life.
The dinner-hour being arrived, Black George carried her up a pullet, the squire himself (for he had sworn not to part with the key) attending the door. As George deposited the dish, some compliments passed between him and Sophia (for he had not seen her since she left the country, and she treated every servant with more respect than some persons shew to those who are in a very slight degree their inferiors). Sophia would have had him take the pullet back, saying, she could not eat; but George begged her to try, and particularly recommended to her the eggs, of which he said it was full.
All this time the squire was waiting at the door; but George was a great favourite with his master, as his employment was in concerns of the highest nature, namely, about the game, and was accustomed to take many liberties. He had officiously carried up the dinner, being, as he
767
said, very desirous to see his young lady; he made therefore no scruple of keeping his master standing above ten minutes, while civilities were passing between him and Sophia, for which he received only a good-humoured rebuke at the door when he returned.
The eggs of pullets, partridges, pheasants, &amp;c., were, as George well knew, the most favourite dainties of Sophia. It was therefore no wonder that he, who was a very good-natured fellow, should take care to supply her with this kind of delicacy, at a time when all the servants in the house were afraid she would be starved; for she had scarce swallowed a single morsel in the last forty hours.
Though vexation hath not the same effect on all persons as it usually hath on a widow, whose appetite it often renders sharper than it can be rendered by the air on Bansted Downs, or Salisbury Plain; yet the sub-limest grief, notwithstanding what some people may say to the contrary, will eat at last. And Sophia, herself, after some little consideration, began to dissect the fowl, which she found to be as full of eggs as George had reported it.
But, if she was pleased with these, it contained something which would have delighted the Royal Society much more; for if a fowl with three legs be so invaluable a curiosity, when perhaps time hath produced a thousand such, at what price shall we esteem a bird which so totally contradicts all the laws of animal oeconomy, as to contain a letter in its belly? Ovid tells us of a flower into which Hyacinthus was metamorphosed, that bears letters on its leaves, which Virgil recommended as a miracle to the Royal Society of his day; but no age nor nation hath ever recorded a bird with a letter in its maw.
But though a miracle of this kind might have engaged all the Academies des Sciences in Europe, and perhaps in a fruitless enquiry; yet the reader, by barely recollecting the last dialogue which passed between Messieurs Jones and Partridge, will be very easily satisfied from whence this letter came, and how it found its passage into the fowl.
Sophia, notwithstanding her long fast, and notwithstanding her favourite dish was there before her, no sooner saw the letter than she immediately snatched it up, tore it open, and read as follows:—
"MADAM,
"Was I not sensible to whom I have the honour of writing, I should endeavour, however difficult, to paint the horrors of my mind at the account brought me by Mrs Honour; but as tenderness alone can have any true idea of the pangs which tenderness is capable of feeling, so can this
768
most amiable quality, which my Sophia possesses in the most eminent degree, sufficiently inform her what her Jones must have suffered on this melancholy occasion. Is there a circumstance in the world which can heighten my agonies, when I hear of any misfortune which hath befallen you? Surely there is one only, and with that I am accursed. It is, my Sophia, the dreadful consideration that I am myself the wretched cause. Perhaps I here do myself too much honour, but none will envy me an honour which costs me so extremely dear. Pardon me this presumption, and pardon me a greater still, if I ask you, whether my advice, my assistance, my presence, my absence, my death, or my tortures can bring you any relief? Can the most perfect admiration, the most watchful observance, the most ardent love, the most melting tenderness, the most resigned submission to your will, make you amends for what you are to sacrifice to my happiness? If they can, fly, my lovely angel, to those arms which are ever open to receive and protect you; and to which, whether you bring yourself alone, or the riches of the world with you, is, in my opinion, an alternative not worth regarding. If, on the contrary, wisdom shall predominate, and, on the most mature reflection, inform you, that the sacrifice is too great; and if there be no way left to reconcile your father, and restore the peace of your dear mind, but by abandoning me, I conjure you drive me for ever from your thoughts, exert your resolution, and let no compassion for my sufferings bear the least weight in that tender bosom. Believe me, madam, I so sincerely love you better than myself, that my great and principal end is your happiness. My first wish (why would not fortune indulge me in it?) was, and pardon me if I say, still is, to see you every moment the happiest of women; my second wish is, to hear you are so; but no misery on earth can equal mine, while I think you owe an uneasy moment to him who is,
Madam, in every sense, and to every purpose, your devoted, THOMAS JONES."
What Sophia said, or did, or thought, upon this letter, how often she read it, or whether more than once, shall all be left to our reader's imagination. The answer to it he may perhaps see hereafter, but not at present: for this reason, among others, that she did not now write any, and that for several good causes, one of which was this, she had no paper, pen, nor ink.
In the evening, while Sophia was meditating on the letter she had received, or on something else, a violent noise from below disturbed her meditations. This noise was no other than a round bout at altercation between two persons. One of the combatants, by his voice, she
769
immediately distinguished to be her father; but she did not so soon discover the shriller pipes to belong to the organ of her aunt Western, who was just arrived in town, where having, by means of one of her servants, who stopt at the Hercules Pillars, learned where her brother lodged, she drove directly to his lodgings.
We shall therefore take our leave at present of Sophia, and, with our usual good-breeding, attend her ladyship.
770
In which Sophia is delivered from her confinement.
The squire and the parson (for the landlord was now otherwise engaged) were smoaking their pipes together, when the arrival of the lady was first signified. The squire no sooner heard her name, than he immediately ran down to usher her upstairs; for he was a great observer of such ceremonials, especially to his sister, of whom he stood more in awe than of any other human creature, though he never would own this, nor did he perhaps know it himself.
Mrs Western, on her arrival in the dining-room, having flung herself into a chair, began thus to harangue: "Well, surely, no one ever had such an intolerable journey. I think the roads, since so many turnpike acts, are grown worse than ever. La, brother, how could you get into this odious place? no person of condition, I dare swear, ever set foot here before." "I don't know," cries the squire, "I think they do well enough; it was landlord recommended them. I thought, as he knew most of the quality, he could best shew me where to get among um." "Well, and where's my niece?" says the lady; "have you been to wait upon Lady Bellaston yet?" "Ay, ay," cries the squire, "your niece is safe enough; she is upstairs in chamber." "How!" answered the lady, "is my niece in this house, and does she not know of my being here?" "No, nobody can well get to her," says the squire, "for she is under lock and key. I have her safe; I vetched her from my lady cousin the first night I came to town, and I have taken care o' her ever since; she is as secure as a fox in a bag, I promise you." "Good heaven!" returned Mrs Western, "what do I hear? I thought what a fine piece of work would be the consequence of my consent to your coming to town yourself; nay, it was indeed your own headstrong will, nor can I charge myself with having ever consented to it. Did not you promise me, brother, that you would take none of these headstrong measures? Was it not by these headstrong measures that you forced my niece to run away from you in the country? Have you a mind to oblige her to take such another step?" "Z一ds and the devil!" cries the squire, dashing his
771
pipe on the ground; "did ever mortal hear the like? when I expected you would have commended me for all I have done, to be fallen upon in this manner!" "How, brother!" said the lady, "have I ever given you the least reason to imagine I should commend you for locking up your daughter? Have I not often told you that women in a free country are not to be treated with such arbitrary power? We are as free as the men, and I heartily wish I could not say we deserve that freedom better. If you expect I should stay a moment longer in this wretched house, or that I should ever own you again as my relation, or that I should ever trouble myself again with the affairs of your family, I insist upon it that my niece be set at liberty this instant." This she spoke with so commanding an air, standing with her back to the fire, with one hand behind her, and a pinch of snuff in the other, that I question whether Thalestris, at the head of her Amazons, ever made a more tremendous figure. It is no wonder, therefore, that the poor squire was not proof against the awe which she inspired. "There," he cried, throwing down the key, "there it is, do whatever you please. I intended only to have kept her up till Blifil came to town, which can't be long; and now if any harm happens in the mean time, remember who is to be blamed for it."
"I will answer it with my life," cried Mrs Western, "but I shall not intermeddle at all, unless upon one condition, and that is, that you will commit the whole entirely to my care, without taking any one measure yourself, unless I shall eventually appoint you to act. If you ratify these preliminaries, brother, I yet will endeavour to preserve the honour of your family; if not, I shall continue in a neutral state."
"I pray you, good sir," said the parson, "permit yourself this once to be admonished by her ladyship: peradventure, by communing with young Madam Sophia, she will effect more than you have been able to perpetrate by more rigorous measures."
"What, dost thee open upon me?" cries the squire: "if thee dost begin to babble, I shall whip thee in presently."
"Fie, brother," answered the lady, "is this language to a clergyman? Mr Supple is a man of sense, and gives you the best advice; and the whole world, I believe, will concur in his opinion; but I must tell you I expect an immediate answer to my categorical proposals. Either cede your daughter to my disposal, or take her wholly to your own surprizing discretion, and then I here, before Mr Supple, evacuate the garrison, and renounce you and your family for ever."
772
"I pray you let me be a mediator," cries the parson, "let me supplicate you."
"Why, there lies the key on the table," cries the squire. "She may take un up, if she pleases: who hinders her?"
"No, brother," answered the lady, "I insist on the formality of its being delivered me, with a full ratification of all the concessions stipulated."
"Why then I will deliver it to you.—There 'tis," cries the squire. "I am sure, sister, you can't accuse me of ever denying to trust my daughter to you. She hath a-lived wi' you a whole year and muore to a time, without my ever zeeing her."
"And it would have been happy for her," answered the lady, "if she had always lived with me. Nothing of this kind would have happened under my eye."
"Ay, certainly," cries he, "I only am to blame."
"Why, you are to blame, brother," answered she. "I have been often obliged to tell you so, and shall always be obliged to tell you so. However, I hope you will now amend, and gather so much experience from past errors, as not to defeat my wisest machinations by your blunders. Indeed, brother, you are not qualified for these negociations. All your whole scheme of politics is wrong. I once more, therefore, insist, that you do not intermeddle. Remember only what is past."------
"Z—ds and bl—d, sister," cries the squire, "what would you have me say? You are enough to provoke the devil."
"There, now," said she, "just according to the old custom. I see, brother, there is no talking to you. I will appeal to Mr Supple, who is a man of sense, if I said anything which could put any human creature into a passion; but you are so wrongheaded every way."
"Let me beg you, madam," said the parson, "not to irritate his worship."
"Irritate him?" said the lady; "sure, you are as great a fool as himself. Well, brother, since you have promised not to interfere, I will once more undertake the management of my niece. Lord have mercy upon all affairs which are under the directions of men! The head of one woman is worth a thousand of yours." And now having summoned a servant to show her to Sophia, she departed, bearing the key with her.
She was no sooner gone, than the squire (having first shut the door) ejaculated twenty bitches, and as many hearty curses against her, not sparing himself for having ever thought of her estate; but added, "Now
773
one hath been a slave so long, it would be pity to lose it at last, for want of holding out a little longer. The bitch can't live for ever, and I know I am down for it upon the will."
The parson greatly commended this resolution: and now the squire having ordered in another bottle, which was his usual method when anything either pleased or vexed him, did, by drinking plentifully of this medicinal julap, so totally wash away his choler, that his temper was become perfectly placid and serene, when Mrs Western returned with Sophia into the room. The young lady had on her hat and capuchin, and the aunt acquainted Mr Western, "that she intended to take her niece with her to her own lodgings; for, indeed, brother," says she, "these rooms are not fit to receive a Christian soul in."
"Very well, madam," quoth Western, "whatever you please. The girl can never be in better hands than yours; and the parson here can do me the justice to say, that I have said fifty times behind your back, that you was one of the most sensible women in the world."
"To this," cries the parson, "I am ready to bear testimony."
"Nay, brother," says Mrs Western, "I have always, I'm sure, given you as favourable a character. You must own you have a little too much hastiness in your temper; but when you will allow yourself time to reflect I never knew a man more reasonable."
"Why then, sister, if you think so," said the squire, "here's your good health with all my heart. I am a little passionate sometimes, but I scorn to bear any malice. Sophy, do you be a good girl, and do everything your aunt orders you."
"I have not the least doubt of her," answered Mrs Western. "She hath had already an example before her eyes in the behaviour of that wretch her cousin Harriet, who ruined herself by neglecting my advice. O brother, what think you? You was hardly gone out of hearing, when you set out for London, when who should arrive but that impudent fellow with the odious Irish name一that Fitzpatrick. He broke in abruptly upon me without notice, or I would not have seen him. He ran on a long, unintelligible story about his wife, to which he forced me to give him a hearing; but I made him very little answer, and delivered him the letter from his wife, which I bid him answer himself. I suppose the wretch will endeavour to find us out, but I beg you will not see her, for I am determined I will not."
"I zee her!" answered the squire; "you need not fear me. I'll ge no encouragement to such undutiful wenches. It is well for the fellow, her
774
husband, I was not at huome. Od rabbit it, he should have taken a dance thru the horse-pond, I promise un. You zee, Sophy, what undutifulness brings volks to. You have an example in your own family."
"Brother," cries the aunt, "you need not shock my niece by such odious repetitions. Why will you not leave everything entirely to me?" "Well, well, I wull, I wull," said the squire.
And now Mrs Western, luckily for Sophia, put an end to the conversation by ordering chairs to be called. I say luckily, for had it continued much longer, fresh matter of dissension would, most probably, have arisen between the brother and sister; between whom education and sex made the only difference; for both were equally violent and equally positive: they had both a vast affection for Sophia, and both a sovereign contempt for each other.

Chapter U
In which Jones receives a letter from Sophia, and goes to a play with Mrs Miller and Partridge.
The arrival of Black George in town, and the good offices which that grateful fellow had promised to do for his old benefactor, greatly comforted Jones in the midst of all the anxiety and uneasiness which he had suffered on the account of Sophia; from whom, by the means of the said George, he received the following answer to his letter, which Sophia, to whom the use of pen, ink, and paper was restored with her liberty, wrote the very evening when she departed from her confinement:
"Sir,
"As I do not doubt your sincerity in what you write, you will be pleased to hear that some of my afflictions are at an end, by the arrival of my aunt Western, with whom I am at present, and with whom I enjoy all the liberty I can desire. One promise my aunt hath insisted on my making, which is, that I will not see or converse with any person without her knowledge and consent. This promise I have most solemnly given, and shall most inviolably keep: and though she hath not expressly forbidden me writing, yet that must be an omission from forgetfulness; or this, perhaps, is included in the word conversing. However, as I cannot but consider this as a breach of her generous confidence in my honour, you cannot expect that I shall, after this, continue to write myself or to receive letters, without her knowledge. A promise is with me a very sacred thing, and to be extended to everything understood from it, as well as to what is expressed by it; and this consideration may, perhaps, on reflection, afford you some comfort. But why should I mention a comfort to you of this kind; for though there is one thing in which I can never comply with the best of fathers, yet am I firmly resolved never to act in defiance of him, or to take any step of consequence without his consent. A firm persuasion of this must teach you to divert your thoughts from what fortune hath (perhaps) made impossible. This your own interest persuades you. This may reconcile, I hope, Mr Allworthy to you; and if it
776
will, you have my injunctions to pursue it. Accidents have laid some obligations on me, and your good intentions probably more. Fortune may, perhaps, be some time kinder to us both than at present. Believe this, that I shall always think of you as I think you deserve, and am,
Sir, your obliged humble servant, Sophia Western.
"I charge you write to me no more一at present at least; and accept this, which is now of no service to me, which I know you must want, and think you owe the trifle only to that fortune by which you found it." 28
A child who hath just learnt his letters would have spelt this letter out in less time than Jones took in reading it. The sensations it occasioned were a mixture of joy and grief; somewhat like what divide the mind of a good man when he peruses the will of his deceased friend, in which a large legacy, which his distresses make the more welcome, is bequeathed to him. Upon the whole, however, he was more pleased than displeased; and, indeed, the reader may probably wonder that he was displeased at all; but the reader is not quite so much in love as was poor Jones; and love is a disease which, though it may, in some instances, resemble a consumption (which it sometimes causes), in others proceeds in direct opposition to it, and particularly in this, that it never flatters itself, or sees any one symptom in a favourable light.
One thing gave him complete satisfaction, which was, that his mistress had regained her liberty, and was now with a lady where she might at least assure herself of a decent treatment. Another comfortable circumstance was the reference which she made to her promise of never marrying any other man; for however disinterested he might imagine his passion, and notwithstanding all the generous overtures made in his letter, I very much question whether he could have heard a more afflicting piece of news than that Sophia was married to another, though the match had been never so great, and never so likely to end in making her completely happy. That refined degree of Platonic affection which is absolutely detached from the flesh, and is, indeed, entirely and purely spiritual, is a gift confined to the female part of the creation; many of whom I have heard declare (and, doubtless, with great truth), that they would, with the utmost readiness, resign a lover to a rival, when such resignation was proved to be necessary for the temporal interest of such lover. Hence, therefore, I conclude that this affection is in nature, though I cannot pretend to say I have ever seen an instance of it.
28.Meaning, perhaps, the bank-bill for £100.
777
Mr Jones having spent three hours in reading and kissing the aforesaid letter, and being, at last, in a state of good spirits, from the last-mentioned considerations, he agreed to carry an appointment, which he had before made, into execution. This was, to attend Mrs Miller, and her younger daughter, into the gallery at the play-house, and to admit Mr Partridge as one of the company. For as Jones had really that taste for humour which many affect, he expected to enjoy much entertainment in the criticisms of Partridge, from whom he expected the simple dictates of nature, unimproved, indeed, but likewise unadulterated, by art.
In the first row then of the first gallery did Mr Jones, Mrs Miller, her youngest daughter, and Partridge, take their places. Partridge immediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in. When the first music was played, he said, "It was a wonder how so many fiddlers could play at one time, without putting one another out." While the fellow was lighting the upper candles, he cried out to Mrs Miller, "Look, look, madam, the very picture of the man in the end of the common-prayer book before the gunpowder-treason service." Nor could he help observing, with a sigh, when all the candles were lighted, "That here were candles enough burnt in one night, to keep an honest poor family for a whole twelvemonth."
As soon as the play, which was Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, began, Partridge was all attention, nor did he break silence till the entrance of the ghost; upon which he asked Jones, "What man that was in the strange dress; something," said he, "like what I have seen in a picture. Sure it is not armour, is it?" Jones answered, "That is the ghost." To which Partridge replied with a smile, "Persuade me to that, sir, if you can. Though I can't say I ever actually saw a ghost in my life, yet I am certain I should know one, if I saw him, better than that comes to. No, no, sir, ghosts don't appear in such dresses as that, neither." In this mistake, which caused much laughter in the neighbourhood of Partridge, he was suffered to continue, till the scene between the ghost and Hamlet, when Partridge gave that credit to Mr Garrick, which he had denied to Jones, and fell into so violent a trembling, that his knees knocked against each other. Jones asked him what was the matter, and whether he was afraid of the warrior upon the stage? "O la! sir," said he, "I perceive now it is what you told me. I am not afraid of anything; for I know it is but a play. And if it was really a ghost, it could do one no harm at such a distance, and in so much company; and yet if I was frightened, I am not the only person." "Why, who," cries Jones, "dost thou take to be such a coward here besides thyself?" "Nay, you may call me coward if you will; but if
778
that little man there upon the stage is not frightened, I never saw any man frightened in my life. Ay, ay: go along with you: Ay, to be sure! Who's fool then? Will you? Lud have mercy upon such fool-hardiness!一Whatever happens, it is good enough for you. Follow you? I'd follow the devil as soon. Nay, perhaps it is the devil-for they say he
can put on what likeness he pleases.一Oh! here he is again.---------No
farther! No, you have gone far enough already; farther than I'd have gone for all the king's dominions." Jones offered to speak, but Partridge cried "Hush, hush! dear sir, don't you hear him?" And during the whole speech of the ghost, he sat with his eyes fixed partly on the ghost and partly on Hamlet, and with his mouth open; the same passions which succeeded each other in Hamlet, succeeding likewise in him.
When the scene was over Jones said, "Why, Partridge, you exceed my expectations. You enjoy the play more than I conceived possible." "Nay, sir," answered Partridge, "if you are not afraid of the devil, I can't help it; but to be sure, it is natural to be surprized at such things, though I know there is nothing in them: not that it was the ghost that surprized me, neither; for I should have known that to have been only a man in a strange dress; but when I saw the little man so frightened himself, it was that which took hold of me." "And dost thou imagine, then, Partridge," cries Jones, "that he was really frightened?" "Nay, sir," said Partridge, "did not you yourself observe afterwards, when he found it was his own father's spirit, and how he was murdered in the garden, how his fear forsook him by degrees, and he was struck dumb with sorrow, as it were, just as I should have been, had it been my own case?一But hush! O la! what noise is that? There he is again.----Well, to be certain, though I
know there is nothing at all in it, I am glad I am not down yonder, where those men are." Then turning his eyes again upon Hamlet, "Ay, you may draw your sword; what signifies a sword against the power of the devil?"
During the second act, Partridge made very few remarks. He greatly admired the fineness of the dresses; nor could he help observing upon the king's countenance. "Well," said he, "how people may be deceived by faces! Nulla fides fronti is, I find, a true saying. Who would think, by looking in the king's face, that he had ever committed a murder?" He then enquired after the ghost; but Jones, who intended he should be surprized, gave him no other satisfaction, than, "that he might possibly see him again soon, and in a flash of fire."
Partridge sat in a fearful expectation of this; and now, when the ghost made his next appearance, Partridge cried out, "There, sir, now; what say
779
you now? is he frightened now or no? As much frightened as you think me, and, to be sure, nobody can help some fears. I would not be in so bad a condition as what's his name, squire Hamlet, is there, for all the world. Bless me! what's become of the spirit? As I am a living soul, I thought I saw him sink into the earth." "Indeed, you saw right," answered Jones. "Well, well," cries Partridge, "I know it is only a play: and besides, if there was anything in all this, Madam Miller would not laugh so; for as to you, sir, you would not be afraid, I believe, if the devil was here in person.一There, there一Ay, no wonder you are in such a passion, shake the vile wicked wretch to pieces. If she was my own mother, I would serve her so. To be sure all duty to a mother is forfeited by such wicked doings.---Ay, go about your business, I hate the sight
of you."
Our critic was now pretty silent till the play, which Hamlet introduces before the king. This he did not at first understand, till Jones explained it to him; but he no sooner entered into the spirit of it, than he began to bless himself that he had never committed murder. Then turning to Mrs Miller, he asked her, "If she did not imagine the king looked as if he was touched; though he is," said he, "a good actor, and doth all he can to hide it. Well, I would not have so much to answer for, as that wicked man there hath, to sit upon a much higher chair than he sits upon. No wonder he ran away; for your sake I'll never trust an innocent face again."
The grave-digging scene next engaged the attention of Partridge, who expressed much surprize at the number of skulls thrown upon the stage. To which Jones answered, "That it was one of the most famous burialplaces about town." "No wonder then," cries Partridge, "that the place is haunted. But I never saw in my life a worse grave-digger. I had a sexton, when I was clerk, that should have dug three graves while he is digging one. The fellow handles a spade as if it was the first time he had ever had one in his hand. Ay, ay, you may sing. You had rather sing than work, I believe."一Upon Hamlet's taking up the skull, he cried out, "Well! it is strange to see how fearless some men are: I never could bring myself to touch anything belonging to a dead man, on any account.一He seemed frightened enough too at the ghost, I thought. Nemo omnibus horis sapit.''
Little more worth remembering occurred during the play, at the end of which Jones asked him, "Which of the players he had liked best?" To this he answered, with some appearance of indignation at the question, "The king, without doubt." "Indeed, Mr Partridge," says Mrs Miller, "you are not of the same opinion with the town; for they are all agreed, that Hamlet is acted by the best player who ever was on the stage." "He the best
780
player!" cries Partridge, with a contemptuous sneer, "why, I could act as well as he myself. I am sure, if I had seen a ghost, I should have looked in the very same manner, and done just as he did. And then, to be sure, in that scene, as you called it, between him and his mother, where you told me he acted so fine, why, Lord help me, any man, that is, any good man, that had such a mother, would have done exactly the same. I know you are only joking with me; but indeed, madam, though I was never at a play in London, yet I have seen acting before in the country; and the king for my money; he speaks all his words distinctly, half as loud again as the other.一Anybody may see he is an actor."
While Mrs Miller was thus engaged in conversation with Partridge, a lady came up to Mr Jones, whom he immediately knew to be Mrs Fitzpatrick. She said, she had seen him from the other part of the gallery, and had taken that opportunity of speaking to him, as she had something to say, which might be of great service to himself. She then acquainted him with her lodgings, and made him an appointment the next day in the morning; which, upon recollection, she presently changed to the afternoon; at which time Jones promised to attend her.
Thus ended the adventure at the playhouse; where Partridge had afforded great mirth, not only to Jones and Mrs Miller, but to all who sat within hearing, who were more attentive to what he said, than to anything that passed on the stage.
He durst not go to bed all that night, for fear of the ghost; and for many nights after sweated two or three hours before he went to sleep, with the same apprehensions, and waked several times in great horrors, crying out, "Lord have mercy upon us! there it is."

In which the history is obliged to look back.
It is almost impossible for the best parent to observe an exact impartiality to his children, even though no superior merit should bias his affection; but sure a parent can hardly be blamed, when that superiority determines his preference.
As I regard all the personages of this history in the light of my children; so I must confess the same inclination of partiality to Sophia; and for that I hope the reader will allow me the same excuse, from the superiority of her character.
This extraordinary tenderness which I have for my heroine never suffers me to quit her any long time without the utmost reluctance. I could now, therefore, return impatiently to enquire what hath happened to this lovely creature since her departure from her father's, but that I am obliged first to pay a short visit to Mr Blifil.
Mr Western, in the first confusion into which his mind was cast upon the sudden news he received of his daughter, and in the first hurry to go after her, had not once thought of sending any account of the discovery to Blifil. He had not gone far, however, before he recollected himself, and accordingly stopt at the very first inn he came to, and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint Blifil with his having found Sophia, and with his firm resolution to marry her to him immediately, if he would come up after him to town.
As the love which Blifil had for Sophia was of that violent kind, which nothing but the loss of her fortune, or some such accident, could lessen, his inclination to the match was not at all altered by her having run away, though he was obliged to lay this to his own account. He very readily, therefore, embraced this offer. Indeed, he now proposed the gratification of a very strong passion besides avarice, by marrying this young lady, and this was hatred; for he concluded that matrimony afforded an equal opportunity of satisfying either hatred or love; and this
782
opinion is very probably verified by much experience. To say the truth, if we are to judge by the ordinary behaviour of married persons to each other, we shall perhaps be apt to conclude that the generality seek the indulgence of the former passion only, in their union of everything but of hearts.
There was one difficulty, however, in his way, and this arose from Mr Allworthy. That good man, when he found by the departure of Sophia (for neither that, nor the cause of it, could be concealed from him), the great aversion which she had for his nephew, began to be seriously concerned that he had been deceived into carrying matters so far. He by no means concurred with the opinion of those parents, who think it as immaterial to consult the inclinations of their children in the affair of marriage, as to solicit the good pleasure of their servants when they intend to take a journey; and who are by law, or decency at least, withheld often from using absolute force. On the contrary, as he esteemed the institution to be of the most sacred kind, he thought every preparatory caution necessary to preserve it holy and inviolate; and very wisely concluded, that the surest way to effect this was by laying the foundation in previous affection.
Blifil indeed soon cured his uncle of all anger on the score of deceit, by many vows and protestations that he had been deceived himself, with which the many declarations of Western very well tallied; but now to persuade Allworthy to consent to the renewing his addresses was a matter of such apparent difficulty, that the very appearance was sufficient to have deterred a less enterprizing genius; but this young gentleman so well knew his own talents, that nothing within the province of cunning seemed to him hard to be achieved.
Here then he represented the violence of his own affection, and the hopes of subduing aversion in the lady by perseverance. He begged that, in an affair on which depended all his future repose, he might at least be at liberty to try all fair means for success. Heaven forbid, he said, that he should ever think of prevailing by any other than the most gentle methods! "Besides, sir," said he, "if they fail, you may then (which will be surely time enough) deny your consent." He urged the great and eager desire which Mr Western had for the match; and lastly, he made great use of the name of Jones, to whom he imputed all that had happened; and from whom, he said, to preserve so valuable a young lady was even an act of charity.
783
All these arguments were well seconded by Thwackum, who dwelt a little stronger on the authority of parents than Mr Blifil himself had done. He ascribed the measures which Mr Blifil was desirous to take to Christian motives; "and though," says he, "the good young gentleman hath mentioned charity last, I am almost convinced it is his first and principal consideration."
Square, possibly, had he been present, would have sung to the same tune, though in a different key, and would have discovered much moral fitness in the proceeding: but he was now gone to Bath for the recovery of his health.
Allworthy, though not without reluctance, at last yielded to the desires of his nephew. He said he would accompany him to London, where he might be at liberty to use every honest endeavour to gain the lady: "But I declare," said he, "I will never give my consent to any absolute force being put on her inclinations, nor shall you ever have her, unless she can be brought freely to compliance."
Thus did the affection of Allworthy for his nephew betray the superior understanding to be triumphed over by the inferior; and thus is the prudence of the best of heads often defeated by the tenderness of the best of hearts.
Blifil, having obtained this unhoped-for acquiescence in his uncle, rested not till he carried his purpose into execution. And as no immediate business required Mr Allworthy's presence in the country, and little preparation is necessary to men for a journey, they set out the very next day, and arrived in town that evening, when Mr Jones, as we have seen, was diverting himself with Partridge at the play.
The morning after his arrival Mr Blifil waited on Mr Western, by whom he was most kindly and graciously received, and from whom he had every possible assurance (perhaps more than was possible) that he should very shortly be as happy as Sophia could make him; nor would the squire suffer the young gentleman to return to his uncle till he had, almost against his will, carried him to his sister.

Chapter /
In which Mr Western pays a visit to his sister, in company with Mr Blifil.
Mrs Western was reading a lecture on prudence, and matrimonial politics, to her niece, when her brother and Blifil broke in with less ceremony than the laws of visiting require. Sophia no sooner saw Blifil than she turned pale, and almost lost the use of all her faculties; but her aunt, on the contrary, waxed red, and, having all her faculties at command, began to exert her tongue on the squire.
"Brother," said she, "I am astonished at your behaviour; will you never learn any regard to decorum? Will you still look upon every apartment as your own, or as belonging to one of your country tenants? Do you think yourself at liberty to invade the privacies of women of condition, without the least decency or notice?"--"Why, what a pox is the matter
now?" quoth the squire; "one would think I had caught you at一"一"None of your brutality, sir, I beseech you," answered she.----"You have surprized my poor niece so, that she can hardly, I see,
support herself.---Go, my dear, retire, and endeavour to recruit your
spirits; for I see you have occasion." At which words Sophia, who never received a more welcome command, hastily withdrew.
"To be sure, sister," cries the squire, "you are mad, when I have brought Mr Blifil here to court her, to force her away."
"Sure, brother," says she, "you are worse than mad, when you know in what situation affairs are, to-1 am sure I ask Mr Blifil's pardon, but he
knows very well to whom to impute so disagreeable a reception. For my own part, I am sure I shall always be very glad to see Mr Blifil; but his own good sense would not have suffered him to proceed so abruptly, had you not compelled him to it."
Blifil bowed and stammered, and looked like a fool; but Western, without giving him time to form a speech for the purpose, answered, "Well, well, I am to blame, if you will, I always am, certainly; but come,
785
let the girl be fetched back again, or let Mr Blifil go to her.-He's come
up on purpose, and there is no time to be lost."
"Brother," cries Mrs Western, "Mr Blifil, I am confident, understands himself better than to think of seeing my niece any more this morning, after what hath happened. Women are of a nice contexture; and our spirits, when disordered, are not to be recomposed in a moment. Had you suffered Mr Blifil to have sent his compliments to my niece, and to have desired the favour of waiting on her in the afternoon, I should possibly have prevailed on her to have seen him; but now I despair of bringing about any such matter."
"I am very sorry, madam," cried Blifil, "that Mr Western's extraordinary kindness to me, which I can never enough acknowledge, should have occasioned一" "Indeed, sir," said she, interrupting him, "you need make no apologies, we all know my brother so well."
"I don't care what anybody knows of me," answered the squire;----"but when must he come to see her? for, consider, I tell you,
he is come up on purpose, and so is Allworthy."一"Brother," said she, "whatever message Mr Blifil thinks proper to send to my niece shall be delivered to her; and I suppose she will want no instructions to make a proper answer. I am convinced she will not refuse to see Mr Blifil at a proper time."—"The devil she won't!" answered the squire.一"Odsbud!一Don't we know一I say nothing, but some volk are wiser than all the world.——If I might have had my will, she had not run away before: and now I expect to hear every moment she is guone again. For as great a fool as some volk think me, I know very well she hates----" "No matter, brother," replied Mrs Western, "I will not hear my
niece abused. It is a reflection on my family. She is an honour to it; and she will be an honour to it, I promise you. I will pawn my whole reputation in the world on her conduct.---1 shall be glad to see you, brother,
in the afternoon; for I have somewhat of importance to mention to you.一At present, Mr Blifil, as well as you, must excuse me; for I am in haste to dress." "Well, but," said the squire, "do appoint a time." "Indeed," said she, "I can appoint no time. I tell you I will see you in the after-noon."一"What the devil would you have me do?" cries the squire, turning to Blifil; "I can no more turn her, than a beagle can turn an old hare. Perhaps she will be in a better humour in the afternoon."—"I am condemned, I see, sir, to misfortune," answered Blifil; "but I shall always own my obligations to you." He then took a ceremonious leave of Mrs Western, who was altogether as ceremonious on her part; and then they
786
departed, the squire muttering to himself with an oath, that Blifil should see his daughter in the afternoon.
If Mr Western was little pleased with this interview, Blifil was less. As to the former, he imputed the whole behaviour of his sister to her humour only, and to her dissatisfaction at the omission of ceremony in the visit; but Blifil saw a little deeper into things. He suspected somewhat of more consequence, from two or three words which dropt from the lady; and, to say the truth, he suspected right, as will appear when I have unfolded the several matters which will be contained in the following chapter.

Chapter V?
Schemes of Lady Bellaston for the ruin of Jones.
Love had taken too deep a root in the mind of Lord Fellamar to be plucked up by the rude hands of Mr Western. In the heat of resentment he had, indeed, given a commission to Captain Egglane, which the captain had far exceeded in the execution; nor had it been executed at all, had his lordship been able to find the captain after he had seen Lady Bel-laston, which was in the afternoon of the day after he had received the affront; but so industrious was the captain in the discharge of his duty, that, having after long enquiry found out the squire's lodgings very late in the evening, he sat up all night at a tavern, that he might not miss the squire in the morning, and by that means missed the revocation which my lord had sent to his lodgings.
In the afternoon then next after the intended rape of Sophia, his lordship, as we have said, made a visit to Lady Bellaston, who laid open so much of the character of the squire, that his lordship plainly saw the absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any offence at his words, especially as he had those honourable designs on his daughter. He then unbosomed the violence of his passion to Lady Bellaston, who readily undertook the cause, and encouraged him with certain assurance of a most favourable reception from all the elders of the family, and from the father himself when he should be sober, and should be made acquainted with the nature of the offer made to his daughter. The only danger, she said, lay in the fellow she had formerly mentioned, who, though a beggar and a vagabond, had, by some means or other, she knew not what, procured himself tolerable cloaths, and past for a gentleman. "Now," says she, "as I have, for the sake of my cousin, made it my business to enquire after this fellow, I have luckily found out his lodgings;" with which she then acquainted his lordship. "I am thinking, my lord," added she "(for this fellow is too mean for your personal resentment), whether it would not be possible for your lordship to contrive some method of having him pressed and sent on board a ship. Neither law nor conscience
788
forbid this project: for the fellow, I promise you, however well drest, is but a vagabond, and as proper as any fellow in the streets to be pressed into the service; and as for the conscientious part, surely the preservation of a young lady from such ruin is a most meritorious act; nay, with regard to the fellow himself, unless he could succeed (which Heaven forbid) with my cousin, it may probably be the means of preserving him from the gallows, and perhaps may make his fortune in an honest way."
Lord Fellamar very heartily thanked her ladyship for the part which she was pleased to take in the affair, upon the success of which his whole future happiness entirely depended. He said, he saw at present no objection to the pressing scheme, and would consider of putting it in execution. He then most earnestly recommended to her ladyship to do him the honour of immediately mentioning his proposals to the family; to whom he said he offered a carte blanche, and would settle his fortune in almost any manner they should require. And after uttering many ecstasies and raptures concerning Sophia, he took his leave and departed, but not before he had received the strongest charge to beware of Jones, and to lose no time in securing his person, where he should no longer be in a capacity of making any attempts to the ruin of the young lady.
The moment Mrs Western was arrived at her lodgings, a card was despatched with her compliments to Lady Bellaston; who no sooner received it than, with the impatience of a lover, she flew to her cousin, rejoiced at this fair opportunity, which beyond her hopes offered itself, for she was much better pleased with the prospect of making the proposals to a woman of sense, and who knew the world, than to a gentleman whom she honoured with the appellation of Hottentot; though, indeed, from him she apprehended no danger of a refusal.
The two ladies being met, after very short previous ceremonials, fell to business, which was indeed almost as soon concluded as begun; for Mrs Western no sooner heard the name of Lord Fellamar than her cheeks glowed with pleasure; but when she was acquainted with the eagerness of his passion, the earnestness of his proposals, and the generosity of his offer, she declared her full satisfaction in the most explicit terms.
In the progress of their conversation their discourse turned to Jones, and both cousins very pathetically lamented the unfortunate attachment which both agreed Sophia had to that young fellow; and Mrs Western entirely attributed it to the folly of her brother's management. She concluded, however, at last, with declaring her confidence in the good understanding of her niece, who, though she would not give up her
789
affection in favour of Blifil, will, I doubt not, says she, soon be prevailed upon to sacrifice a simple inclination to the addresses of a fine gentleman, who brings her both a title and a large estate: "For, indeed," added she, "I must do Sophy the justice to confess this Blifil is but a hideous kind of fellow, as you know, Bellaston, all country gentlemen are, and hath nothing but his fortune to recommend him."
"Nay," said Lady Bellaston, "I don't then so much wonder at my cousin; for I promise you this Jones is a very agreeable fellow, and hath one virtue, which the men say is a great recommendation to us. What do you think, Mrs Western一I shall certainly make you laugh; nay, I can hardly tell you myself for laughing一will you believe that the fellow hath had the assurance to make love to me? But if you should be inclined to disbelieve it, here is evidence enough, his own handwriting, I assure you." She then delivered her cousin the letter with the proposals of marriage, which, if the reader hath a desire to see, he will find already on record in the XVth book of this history.
"Upon my word I am astonished," said Mrs Western; "this is, indeed, a masterpiece of assurance. With your leave I may possibly make some use of this letter." "You have my full liberty," cries Lady Bellaston, "to apply it to what purpose you please. However, I would not have it shewn to any but Miss Western, nor to her unless you find occasion." "Well, and how did you use the fellow?" returned Mrs Western. "Not as a husband," said the lady; "I am not married, I promise you, my dear. You know, Bell, I have tried the comforts once already; and once, I think, is enough for any reasonable woman."
This letter Lady Bellaston thought would certainly turn the balance against Jones in the mind of Sophia, and she was emboldened to give it up, partly by her hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the way, and partly by having secured the evidence of Honour, who, upon sounding her, she saw sufficient reason to imagine was prepared to testify whatever she pleased.
But perhaps the reader may wonder why Lady Bellaston, who in her heart hated Sophia, should be so desirous of promoting a match which was so much to the interest of the young lady. Now, I would desire such readers to look carefully into human nature, page almost the last, and there he will find, in scarce legible characters, that women, notwithstanding the preposterous behaviour of mothers, aunts, &amp;c., in matrimonial matters, do in reality think it so great a misfortune to have their inclinations in love thwarted, that they imagine they ought never to carry
790
enmity higher than upon these disappointments; again, he will find it written much about the same place, that a woman who hath once been pleased with the possession of a man, will go above halfway to the devil, to prevent any other woman from enjoying the same.
If he will not be contented with these reasons, I freely confess I see no other motive to the actions of that lady, unless we will conceive she was bribed by Lord Fellamar, which for my own part I see no cause to suspect.
Now this was the affair which Mrs Western was preparing to introduce to Sophia, by some prefatory discourse on the folly of love, and on the wisdom of legal prostitution for hire, when her brother and Blifil broke abruptly in upon her; and hence arose all that coldness in her behaviour to Blifil, which, though the squire, as was usual with him, imputed to a wrong cause, infused into Blifil himself (he being a much more cunning man) a suspicion of the real truth.

Chapter J
In which Jones pays a visit to Mrs Fitzpatrick.
The reader may now, perhaps, be pleased to return with us to Mr Jones, who, at the appointed hour, attended on Mrs Fitzpatrick; but before we relate the conversation which now past it may be proper, according to our method, to return a little back, and to account for so great an alteration of behaviour in this lady, that from changing her lodging principally to avoid Mr Jones, she had now industriously, as hath been seen, sought this interview.
And here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding day, when, hearing from Lady Bellaston that Mr Western was arrived in town, she went to pay her duty to him, at his lodgings at Piccadilly, where she was received with many scurvy compellations too coarse to be repeated, and was even threatened to be kicked out of doors. From hence, an old servant of her aunt Western, with whom she was well acquainted, conducted her to the lodgings of that lady, who treated her not more kindly, but more politely; or, to say the truth, with rudeness in another way. In short, she returned from both, plainly convinced, not only that her scheme of reconciliation had proved abortive, but that she must for ever give over all thoughts of bringing it about by any means whatever. From this moment desire of revenge only filled her mind; and in this temper meeting Jones at the play, an opportunity seemed to her to occur of effecting this purpose.
The reader must remember that he was acquainted by Mrs Fitzpatrick, in the account she gave of her own story, with the fondness Mrs Western had formerly shewn for Mr Fitzpatrick at Bath, from the disappointment of which Mrs Fitzpatrick derived the great bitterness her aunt had expressed toward her. She had, therefore, no doubt but that the good lady would as easily listen to the addresses of Mr Jones as she had before done to the other; for the superiority of charms was clearly on the side of Mr Jones; and the advance which her aunt had since made in age, she
792
concluded (how justly I will not say), was an argument rather in favour of her project than against it.
Therefore, when Jones attended, after a previous declaration of her desire of serving him, arising, as she said, from a firm assurance how much she should by so doing oblige Sophia; and after some excuses for her former disappointment, and after acquainting Mr Jones in whose custody his mistress was, of which she thought him ignorant; she very explicitly mentioned her scheme to him, and advised him to make sham addresses to the older lady, in order to procure an easy access to the younger, informing him at the same time of the success which Mr Fitzpatrick had formerly owed to the very same stratagem.
Mr Jones expressed great gratitude to the lady for the kind intentions towards him which she had expressed, and indeed testified, by this proposal; but, besides intimating some diffidence of success from the lady's knowledge of his love to her niece, which had not been her case in regard to Mr Fitzpatrick, he said, he was afraid Miss Western would never agree to an imposition of this kind, as well from her utter detestation of all fallacy as from her avowed duty to her aunt.
Mrs Fitzpatrick was a little nettled at this; and indeed, if it may not be called a lapse of the tongue, it was a small deviation from politeness in Jones, and into which he scarce would have fallen, had not the delight he felt in praising Sophia hurried him out of all reflection; for this commendation of one cousin was more than a tacit rebuke on the other.
"Indeed, sir," answered the lady, with some warmth, "I cannot think there is anything easier than to cheat an old woman with a profession of love, when her complexion is amorous; and, though she is my aunt, I must say there never was a more liquorish one than her ladyship. Can't you pretend that the despair of possessing her niece, from her being promised to Blifil, has made you turn your thoughts towards her? As to my cousin Sophia, I can't imagine her to be such a simpleton as to have the least scruple on such an account, or to conceive any harm in punishing one of these haggs for the many mischiefs they bring upon families by their tragi-comic passions; for which I think it is a pity they are not punishable by law. I had no such scruple myself; and yet I hope my cousin Sophia will not think it an affront when I say she cannot detest every real species of falsehood more than her cousin Fitzpatrick. To my aunt, indeed, I pretend no duty, nor doth she deserve any. However, sir, I have given you my advice; and if you decline pursuing it, I shall have the less opinion of your understanding一that's all."
793
Jones now clearly saw the error he had committed, and exerted his utmost power to rectify it; but he only faultered and stuttered into nonsense and contradiction. To say the truth, it is often safer to abide by the consequences of the first blunder than to endeavour to rectify it; for by such endeavours we generally plunge deeper instead of extricating ourselves; and few persons will on such occasions have the good-nature which Mrs Fitzpatrick displayed to Jones, by saying, with a smile, "You need attempt no more excuses; for I can easily forgive a real lover, whatever is the effect of fondness for his mistress."
She then renewed her proposal, and very fervently recommended it, omitting no argument which her invention could suggest on the subject; for she was so violently incensed against her aunt, that scarce anything was capable of affording her equal pleasure with exposing her; and, like a true woman, she would see no difficulties in the execution of a favourite scheme.
Jones, however, persisted in declining the undertaking, which had not, indeed, the least probability of success. He easily perceived the motives which induced Mrs Fitzpatrick to be so eager in pressing her advice. He said he would not deny the tender and passionate regard he had for Sophia; but was so conscious of the inequality of their situations, that he could never flatter himself so far as to hope that so divine a young lady would condescend to think on so unworthy a man; nay, he protested, he could scarce bring himself to wish she should. He concluded with a profession of generous sentiments, which we have not at present leisure to insert.
There are some fine women (for I dare not here speak in too general terms) with whom self is so predominant, that they never detach it from any subject; and, as vanity is with them a ruling principle, they are apt to lay hold of whatever praise they meet with; and, though the property of others, convey it to their own use. In the company of these ladies it is impossible to say anything handsome of another woman which they will not apply to themselves; nay, they often improve the praise they seize; as, for instance, if her beauty, her wit, her gentility, her good humour deserve so much commendation, what do I deserve, who possess those qualities in so much more eminent a degree?
To these ladies a man often recommends himself while he is commending another woman; and, while he is expressing ardour and generous sentiments for his mistress, they are considering what a charming lover this man would make to them, who can feel all this tenderness for
794
an inferior degree of merit. Of this, strange as it may seem, I have seen many instances besides Mrs Fitzpatrick, to whom all this really happened, and who now began to feel a somewhat for Mr Jones, the symptoms of which she much sooner understood than poor Sophia had formerly done.
To say the truth, perfect beauty in both sexes is a more irresistible object than it is generally thought; for, notwithstanding some of us are contented with more homely lots, and learn by rote (as children to repeat what gives them no idea) to despise outside, and to value more solid charms; yet I have always observed, at the approach of consummate beauty, that these more solid charms only shine with that kind of lustre which the stars have after the rising of the sun.
When Jones had finished his exclamations, many of which would have become the mouth of Oroondates himself, Mrs Fitzpatrick heaved a deep sigh, and, taking her eyes off from Jones, on whom they had been some time fixed, and dropping them on the ground, she cried, "Indeed, Mr Jones, I pity you; but it is the curse of such tenderness to be thrown away on those who are insensible of it. I know my cousin better than you, Mr Jones, and I must say, any woman who makes no return to such a passion, and such a person, is unworthy of both."
"Sure, madam," said Jones, "you can't mean-------" "Mean!" cries Mrs
Fitzpatrick, "I know not what I mean; there is something, I think, in true tenderness bewitching; few women ever meet with it in men, and fewer still know how to value it when they do. I never heard such truly noble sentiments, and I can't tell how it is, but you force one to believe you. Sure she must be the most contemptible of women who can overlook such merit."
The manner and look with which all this was spoke infused a suspicion into Jones which we don't care to convey in direct words to the reader. Instead of making any answer, he said, "I am afraid, madam, I have made too tiresome a visit;" and offered to take his leave.
"Not at all, sir," answered Mrs Fitzpatrick.一"Indeed I pity you, Mr Jones; indeed I do: but if you are going, consider of the scheme I have mentioned一I am convinced you will approve it一and let me see you again as soon as you can.一To-morrow morning if you will, or at least some time to-morrow. I shall be at home all day."
Jones, then, after many expressions of thanks, very respectfully retired; nor could Mrs Fitzpatrick forbear making him a present of a look at parting, by which if he had understood nothing, he must have had no
795
understanding in the language of the eyes. In reality, it confirmed his resolution of returning to her no more; for, faulty as he hath hitherto appeared in this history, his whole thoughts were now so confined to his Sophia, that I believe no woman upon earth could have now drawn him into an act of inconstancy.
Fortune, however, who was not his friend, resolved, as he intended to give her no second opportunity, to make the best of this; and accordingly produced the tragical incident which we are now in sorrowful notes to record.

Chapter A Vx
The consequence of the preceding visit.
Mr Fitzpatrick having received the letter before mentioned from Mrs Western, and being by that means acquainted with the place to which his wife was retired, returned directly to Bath, and thence the day after set forward to London.
The reader hath been already often informed of the jealous temper of this gentleman. He may likewise be pleased to remember the suspicion which he had conceived of Jones at Upton, upon his finding him in the room with Mrs Waters; and, though sufficient reasons had afterwards appeared entirely to clear up that suspicion, yet now the reading so handsome a character of Mr Jones from his wife, caused him to reflect that she likewise was in the inn at the same time, and jumbled together such a confusion of circumstances in a head which was naturally none of the clearest, that the whole produced that green-eyed monster mentioned by Shakespear in his tragedy of Othello.
And now, as he was enquiring in the street after his wife, and had just received directions to the door, unfortunately Mr Jones was issuing from it.
Fitzpatrick did not yet recollect the face of Jones; however, seeing a young well-dressed fellow coming from his wife, he made directly up to him, and asked him what he had been doing in that house? "for I am sure," said he, "you must have been in it, as I saw you come out of it."
Jones answered very modestly, "That he had been visiting a lady there." To which Fitzpatrick replied, "What business have you with the lady?" Upon which Jones, who now perfectly remembered the voice, features, and indeed coat, of the gentleman, cried out-----"Ha, my good
friend! give me your hand; I hope there is no ill blood remaining between us, upon a small mistake which happened so long ago."
"Upon my soul, sir," said Fitzpatrick, "I don't know your name nor your face." "Indeed, sir," said Jones, "neither have I the pleasure of
797
knowing your name, but your face I very well remember to have seen before at Upton, where a foolish quarrel happened between us, which, if it is not made up yet, we will now make up over a bottle."
"At Upton!" cried the other;-----"Ha! upon my soul, I believe your
name is Jones?" "Indeed," answered he, "it is."一"O! upon my soul," cries Fitzpatrick, "you are the very man I wanted to meet.一Upon my soul I will drink a bottle with you presently; but first I will give you a great knock over the pate. There is for you, you rascal. Upon my soul, if you do not give me satisfaction for that blow, I will give you another." And then, drawing his sword, put himself in a posture of defence, which was the only science he understood.
Jones was a little staggered by the blow, which came somewhat unexpectedly; but presently recovering himself he also drew, and though he understood nothing of fencing, prest on so boldly upon Fitzpatrick, that he beat down his guard, and sheathed one half of his sword in the body of the said gentleman, who had no sooner received it than he stept backwards, dropped the point of his sword, and leaning upon it, cried, "I have satisfaction enough: I am a dead man."
"I hope not," cries Jones, "but whatever be the consequence, you must be sensible you have drawn it upon yourself." At this instant a number of fellows rushed in and seized Jones, who told them he should make no resistance, and begged some of them at least would take care of the wounded gentleman.
"Ay," cries one of the fellows, "the wounded gentleman will be taken care enough of; for I suppose he hath not many hours to live. As for you, sir, you have a month at least good yet." "D一n me, Jack," said another, "he hath prevented his voyage; he's bound to another port now;" and many other such jests was our poor Jones made the subject of by these fellows, who were indeed the gang employed by Lord Fellamar, and had dogged him into the house of Mrs Fitzpatrick, waiting for him at the corner of the street when this unfortunate accident happened.
The officer who commanded this gang very wisely concluded that his business was now to deliver his prisoner into the hands of the civil magistrate. He ordered him, therefore, to be carried to a public-house, where, having sent for a constable, he delivered him to his custody.
The constable, seeing Mr Jones very well drest, and hearing that the accident had happened in a duel, treated his prisoner with great civility, and at his request dispatched a messenger to enquire after the wounded gentleman, who was now at a tavern under the surgeon's hands. The
798
report brought back was, that the wound was certainly mortal, and there were no hopes of life. Upon which the constable informed Jones that he must go before a justice. He answered, "Wherever you please; I am indifferent as to what happens to me; for though I am convinced I am not guilty of murder in the eye of the law, yet the weight of blood I find intolerable upon my mind."
Jones was now conducted before the justice, where the surgeon who dressed Mr Fitzpatrick appeared, and deposed that he believed the wound to be mortal; upon which the prisoner was committed to the Gatehouse. It was very late at night, so that Jones would not send for Partridge till the next morning; and, as he never shut his eyes till seven, so it was near twelve before the poor fellow, who was greatly frightened at not hearing from his master so long, received a message which almost deprived him of his being when he heard it.
He went to the Gatehouse with trembling knees and a beating heart, and was no sooner arrived in the presence of Jones than he lamented the misfortune that had befallen him with many tears, looking all the while frequently about him in great terror; for as the news now arrived that Mr Fitzpatrick was dead, the poor fellow apprehended every minute that his ghost would enter the room. At last he delivered him a letter, which he had like to have forgot, and which came from Sophia by the hands of Black George.
Jones presently dispatched every one out of the room, and, having eagerly broke open the letter, read as follows:一
"You owe the hearing from me again to an accident which I own surprizes me. My aunt hath just now shown me a letter from you to Lady Bellaston, which contains a proposal of marriage. I am convinced it is your own hand; and what more surprizes me is, that it is dated at the very time when you would have me imagine you was under such concern on my account.一I leave you to comment on this fact. All I desire is, that your name may never more be mentioned to
"S. W."
Of the present situation of Mr Jones's mind, and of the pangs with which he was now tormented, we cannot give the reader a better idea than by saying, his misery was such that even Thwackum would almost have pitied him. But, bad as it is, we shall at present leave him in it, as his good genius (if he really had any) seems to have done. And here we put an end to the sixteenth book of our history.

Chapter 且
Containing a portion of introductory writing.
When a comic writer hath made his principal characters as happy as he can, or when a tragic writer hath brought them to the highest pitch of human misery, they both conclude their business to be done, and that their work is come to a period.
Had we been of the tragic complexion, the reader must now allow we were very nearly arrived at this period, since it would be difficult for the devil, or any of his representatives on earth, to have contrived much greater torments for poor Jones than those in which we left him in the last chapter; and as for Sophia, a good-natured woman would hardly wish more uneasiness to a rival than what she must at present be supposed to feel. What then remains to complete the tragedy but a murder or two and a few moral sentences!
But to bring our favourites out of their present anguish and distress, and to land them at last on the shore of happiness, seems a much harder task; a task indeed so hard that we do not undertake to execute it. In regard to Sophia, it is more than probable that we shall somewhere or other provide a good husband for her in the end一either Blifil, or my lord, or somebody else; but as to poor Jones, such are the calamities in which he is at present involved, owing to his imprudence, by which if a man doth not become felon to the world, he is at least a felo de se; so destitute is he now of friends, and so persecuted by enemies, that we almost despair of bringing him to any good; and if our reader delights in seeing executions, I think he ought not to lose any time in taking a first row at Tyburn.
This I faithfully promise, that, notwithstanding any affection which we may be supposed to have for this rogue, whom we have unfortunately made our heroe, we will lend him none of that supernatural assistance with which we are entrusted, upon condition that we use it only on very important occasions. If he doth not therefore find some natural means of
801
fairly extricating himself from all his distresses, we will do no violence to the truth and dignity of history for his sake; for we had rather relate that he was hanged at Tyburn (which may very probably be the case) than forfeit our integrity, or shock the faith of our reader.
In this the antients had a great advantage over the moderns. Their mythology, which was at that time more firmly believed by the vulgar than any religion is at present, gave them always an opportunity of delivering a favourite heroe. Their deities were always ready at the writer's elbow, to execute any of his purposes; and the more extraordinary the invention was, the greater was the surprize and delight of the credulous reader. Those writers could with greater ease have conveyed a heroe from one country to another, nay from one world to another, and have brought him back again, than a poor circumscribed modern can deliver him from a jail.
The Arabians and Persians had an equal advantage in writing their tales from the genii and fairies, which they believe in as an article of their faith, upon the authority of the Koran itself. But we have none of these helps. To natural means alone we are confined; let us try therefore what, by these means, may be done for poor Jones; though to confess the truth, something whispers me in the ear that he doth not yet know the worst of his fortune; and that a more shocking piece of news than any he hath yet heard remains for him in the unopened leaves of fate.

Chapter
The generous and grateful behaviour of Mrs Miller.
Mr Allworthy and Mrs Miller were just sat down to breakfast, when Blifil, who had gone out very early that morning, returned to make one of the company.
He had not been long seated before he began as follows: "Good Lord! my dear uncle, what do you think hath happened? I vow I am afraid of telling it you, for fear of shocking you with the remembrance of ever having shewn any kindness to such a villain." "What is the matter, child?" said the uncle. "I fear I have shewn kindness in my life to the unworthy more than once. But charity doth not adopt the vices of its objects." "O, sir!" returned Blifil, "it is not without the secret direction of Providence that you mention the word adoption. Your adopted son, sir, that Jones, that wretch whom you nourished in your bosom, hath proved one of the greatest villains upon earth." "By all that's sacred 'tis false," cries Mrs Miller. "Mr Jones is no villain. He is one of the worthiest creatures breathing; and if any other person had called him villain, I would have thrown all this boiling water in his face." Mr Allworthy looked very much amazed at this behaviour. But she did not give him leave to speak, before, turning to him, she cried, "I hope you will not be angry with me; I would not offend you, sir, for the world; but, indeed, I could not bear to hear him called so." "I must own, madam," said Allworthy, very gravely, "I am a little surprized to hear you so warmly defend a fellow you do not know." "O! I do know him, Mr Allworthy," said she, "indeed I do; I should be the most ungrateful of all wretches if I denied it. O! he hath preserved me and my little family; we have all reason to bless him while we live.一And I pray Heaven to bless him, and turn the hearts of his malicious enemies. I know, I find, I see, he hath such." "You surprize me, madam, still more," said Allworthy; "sure you must mean some other. It is impossible you should have any such obligations to the man my nephew mentions." "Too surely," answered she, "I have obligations to him of the greatest and tenderest kind. He hath been
803
the preserver of me and mine. Believe me, sir, he hath been abused, grossly abused to you; I know he hath, or you, whom I know to be all goodness and honour, would not, after the many kind and tender things I have heard you say of this poor helpless child, have so disdainfully called him fellow.一Indeed, my best of friends, he deserves a kinder appellation from you, had you heard the good, the kind, the grateful things which I have heard him utter of you. He never mentions your name but with a sort of adoration. In this very room I have seen him on his knees, imploring all the blessings of heaven upon your head. I do not love that child there better than he loves you."
"I see, sir, now," said Blifil, with one of those grinning sneers with which the devil marks his best beloved, "Mrs Miller really doth know him. I suppose you will find she is not the only one of your acquaintance to whom he hath exposed you. As for my character, I perceive, by some hints she hath thrown out, he hath been very free with it, but I forgive him." "And the Lord forgive you, sir!" said Mrs Miller; "we have all sins enough to stand in need of his forgiveness."
"Upon my word, Mrs Miller," said Allworthy, "I do not take this behaviour of yours to my nephew kindly; and I do assure you, as any reflections which you cast upon him must come only from that wickedest of men, they would only serve, if that were possible, to heighten my resentment against him: for I must tell you, Mrs Miller, the young man who now stands before you hath ever been the warmest advocate for the ungrateful wretch whose cause you espouse. This, I think, when you hear it from my own mouth, will make you wonder at so much baseness and ingratitude."
"You are deceived, sir," answered Mrs Miller; "if they were the last words which were to issue from my lips, I would say you were deceived; and I once more repeat it, the Lord forgive those who have deceived you! I do not pretend to say the young man is without faults; but they are all the faults of wildness and of youth; faults which he may, nay, which I am certain he will, relinquish, and, if he should not, they are vastly overbalanced by one of the most humane, tender, honest hearts that ever man was blest with."
"Indeed, Mrs Miller," said Allworthy, "had this been related of you, I should not have believed it." "Indeed, sir," answered she, "you will believe everything I have said, I am sure you will: and when you have heard the story which I shall tell you (for I will tell you all), you will be so far from being offended, that you will own (I know your justice so
804
well), that I must have been the most despicable and most ungrateful of wretches if I had acted any other part than I have."
"Well, madam," said Allworthy, "I shall be very glad to hear any good excuse for a behaviour which, I must confess, I think wants an excuse. And now, madam, will you be pleased to let my nephew proceed in his story without interruption. He would not have introduced a matter of slight consequence with such a preface. Perhaps even this story will cure you of your mistake."
Mrs Miller gave tokens of submission, and then Mr Blifil began thus: "I am sure, sir, if you don't think proper to resent the ill-usage of Mrs Miller, I shall easily forgive what affects me only. I think your goodness hath not deserved this indignity at her hands." "Well, child," said Allworthy, "but what is this new instance? What hath he done of late?" "What," cries Blifil, "notwithstanding all Mrs Miller hath said, I am very sorry to relate, and what you should never have heard from me, had it not been a matter impossible to conceal from the whole world. In short he hath killed a man; I will not say murdered—for perhaps it may not be so construed in law, and I hope the best for his sake."
Allworthy looked shocked, and blessed himself; and then, turning to Mrs Miller, he cried, "Well, madam, what say you now?"
"Why, I say, sir," answered she, "that I never was more concerned at anything in my life; but, if the fact be true, I am convinced the man, whoever he is, was in fault. Heaven knows there are many villains in this town who make it their business to provoke young gentlemen. Nothing but the greatest provocation could have tempted him; for of all the gentlemen I ever had in my house, I never saw one so gentle or so sweet-tempered. He was beloved by every one in the house, and every one who came near it."
While she was thus running on, a violent knocking at the door interrupted their conversation, and prevented her from proceeding further, or from receiving any answer; for, as she concluded this was a visitor to Mr Allworthy, she hastily retired, taking with her her little girl, whose eyes were all over blubbered at the melancholy news she heard of Jones, who used to call her his little wife, and not only gave her many playthings, but spent whole hours in playing with her himself.
Some readers may, perhaps, be pleased with these minute circumstances, in relating of which we follow the example of Plutarch, one of the best of our brother historians; and others, to whom they may appear
805
trivial, will, we hope, at least pardon them, as we are never prolix on such occasions.

Chapter U
The arrival of Mr Western, with some matters concerning the paternal authority.
Mrs Miller had not long left the room when Mr Western entered; but not before a small wrangling bout had passed between him and his chairmen; for the fellows, who had taken up their burden at the Hercules Pillars, had conceived no hopes of having any future good customer in the squire; and they were moreover farther encouraged by his generosity (for he had given them of his own accord sixpence more than their fare); they therefore very boldly demanded another shilling, which so provoked the squire, that he not only bestowed many hearty curses on them at the door, but retained his anger after he came into the room; swearing that all the Londoners were like the court, and thought of nothing but plundering country gentlemen. "D一n me," says he, "if I won't walk in the rain rather than get into one of their hand-barrows again. They have jolted me more in a mile than Brown Bess would in a long fox-chase."
When his wrath on this occasion was a little appeased, he resumed the same passionate tone on another. "There," says he, "there is fine business forwards now. The hounds have changed at last; and when we imagined we had a fox to deal with, od-rat it, it turns out to be a badger at last!"
"Pray, my good neighbour," said Allworthy, "drop your metaphors, and speak a little plainer." "Why, then," says the squire, "to tell you plainly, we have been all this time afraid of a son of a whore of a bastard of somebody's, I don't know whose, not I. And now here's a confounded son of a whore of a lord, who may be a bastard too for what I know or care, for he shall never have a daughter of mine by my consent. They have beggared the nation, but they shall never beggar me. My land shall never be sent over to Hanover."
"You surprize me much, my good friend," said Allworthy. "Why, zounds! I am surprized myself," answered the squire. "I went to zee sister Western last night, according to her own appointment, and there I
807
was had into a whole room full of women. There was my lady cousin Bellaston, and my Lady Betty, and my Lady Catherine, and my lady I don't know who; d一n me, if ever you catch me among such a kennel of hoop-petticoat b一s! D一n me, I'd rather be run by my own dogs, as one Acton was, that the story-book says was turned into a hare, and his own dogs killed un and eat un. Od-rabbit it, no mortal was ever run in such a manner; if I dodged one way, one had me; if I offered to clap back, another snapped me.、O! certainly one of the greatest matches in England,' says one cousin (here he attempted to mimic them); 'A very advantageous offer indeed,' cries another cousin (for you must know they be all my cousins, thof I never zeed half o' um before). 'Surely,' says that fat a一se b一, my Lady Bellaston, 'cousin, you must be out of your wits to think of refusing such an offer.'"
"Now I begin to understand," says Allworthy; "some person hath made proposals to Miss Western, which the ladies of the family approve, but is not to your liking."
"My liking!" said Western, "how the devil should it? I tell you it is a lord, and those are always volks whom you know I always resolved to have nothing to do with. Did unt I refuse a matter of vorty years' purchase now for a bit of land, which one o' um had a mind to put into a park, only because I would have no dealings with lords, and dost think I would marry my daughter zu? Besides, ben't I engaged to you, and did I ever go off any bargain when I had promised?"
"As to that point, neighbour," said Allworthy, "I entirely release you from any engagement. No contract can be binding between parties who have not a full power to make it at the time, nor ever afterwards acquire the power of fulfilling it."
"Slud! then," answered Western, "I tell you I have power, and I will fulfil it. Come along with me directly to Doctors' Commons, I will get a licence; and I will go to sister and take away the wench by force, and she shall ha un, or I will lock her up, and keep her upon bread and water as long as she lives."
"Mr Western," said Allworthy, "shall I beg you will hear my full sentiments on this matter?"一"Hear thee; ay, to be sure I will," answered he. "Why, then, sir," cries Allworthy, "I can truly say, without a compliment either to you or the young lady, that when this match was proposed, I embraced it very readily and heartily, from my regard to you both. An alliance between two families so nearly neighbours, and between whom there had always existed so mutual an intercourse and good harmony, I
808
thought a most desirable event; and with regard to the young lady, not only the concurrent opinion of all who knew her, but my own observation assured me that she would be an inestimable treasure to a good husband. I shall say nothing of her personal qualifications, which certainly are admirable; her good nature, her charitable disposition, her modesty, are too well known to need any panegyric: but she hath one quality which existed in a high degree in that best of women, who is now one of the first of angels, which, as it is not of a glaring kind, more commonly escapes observation; so little indeed is it remarked, that I want a word to express it. I must use negatives on this occasion. I never heard anything of pertness, or what is called repartee, out of her mouth; no pretence to wit, much less to that kind of wisdom which is the result only of great learning and experience, the affectation of which, in a young woman, is as absurd as any of the affectations of an ape. No dictatorial sentiments, no judicial opinions, no profound criticisms. Whenever I have seen her in the company of men, she hath been all attention, with the modesty of a learner, not the forwardness of a teacher. You'll pardon me for it, but I once, to try her only, desired her opinion on a point which was controverted between Mr Thwackum and Mr Square. To which she answered, with much sweetness, 'You will pardon me, good Mr Allworthy; I am sure you cannot in earnest think me capable of deciding any point in which two such gentlemen disagree.' Thwackum and Square, who both alike thought themselves sure of a favourable decision, seconded my request. She answered with the same good humour, 'I must absolutely be excused: for I will affront neither so much as to give my judgment on his side.' Indeed, she always shewed the highest deference to the understandings of men; a quality absolutely essential to the making a good wife. I shall only add, that as she is most apparently void of all affectation, this deference must be certainly real."
Here Blifil sighed bitterly; upon which Western, whose eyes were full of tears at the praise of Sophia, blubbered out, "Don't be chicken-hearted, for shat ha her, d一n me, shat ha her, if she was twenty times as good."
"Remember your promise, sir," cried Allworthy, "I was not to be interrupted." "Well, shat unt," answered the squire; "I won't speak another word."
"Now, my good friend," continued Allworthy, "I have dwelt so long on the merit of this young lady, partly as I really am in love with her character, and partly that fortune (for the match in that light is really advantageous on my nephew's side) might not be imagined to be my principal view in having so eagerly embraced the proposal. Indeed, I heartily
809
wished to receive so great a jewel into my family; but though I may wish for many good things, I would not, therefore, steal them, or be guilty of any violence or injustice to possess myself of them. Now to force a woman into a marriage contrary to her consent or approbation, is an act of such injustice and oppression, that I wish the laws of our country could restrain it; but a good conscience is never lawless in the worst regulated state, and will provide those laws for itself, which the neglect of legislators hath forgotten to supply. This is surely a case of that kind; for, is it not cruel, nay, impious, to force a woman into that state against her will; for her behaviour in which she is to be accountable to the highest and most dreadful court of judicature, and to answer at the peril of her soul? To discharge the matrimonial duties in an adequate manner is no easy task; and shall we lay this burthen upon a woman, while we at the same time deprive her of all that assistance which may enable her to undergo it? Shall we tear her very heart from her, while we enjoin her duties to which a whole heart is scarce equal? I must speak very plainly here. I think parents who act in this manner are accessories to all the guilt which their children afterwards incur, and of course must, before a just judge, expect to partake of their punishment; but if they could avoid this, good heaven! is there a soul who can bear the thought of having contributed to the damnation of his child?
"For these reasons, my best neighbour, as I see the inclinations of this young lady are most unhappily averse to my nephew, I must decline any further thoughts of the honour you intended him, though I assure you I shall always retain the most grateful sense of it."
"Well, sir," said Western (the froth bursting forth from his lips the moment they were uncorked), "you cannot say but I have heard you out, and now I expect you'll hear me; and if I don't answer every word on't, why then I'll consent to gee the matter up. First then, I desire you to answer me one question一Did not I beget her? did not I beget her? answer me that. They say, indeed, it is a wise father that knows his own child; but I am sure I have the best title to her, for I bred her up. But I believe you will allow me to be her father, and if I be, am I not to govern my own child? I ask you that, am I not to govern my own child? and if I am to govern her in other matters, surely I am to govern her in this, which concerns her most. And what am I desiring all this while? Am I desiring her to do anything for me? to give me anything?一Zu much on t'other side, that I am only desiring her to take away half my estate now, and t'other half when I die. Well, and what is it all vor? Why, is unt it to make her happy? It's enough to make one mad to hear volks talk; if I was
810
going to marry myself, then she would ha reason to cry and to blubber; but, on the contrary, han't I offered to bind down my land in such a manner, that I could not marry if I would, seeing as narro' woman upon earth would ha me. What the devil in hell can I do more? I contribute to her damnation!—Zounds! I'd zee all the world d—n'd bevore her little vinger should be hurt. Indeed, Mr Allworthy, you must excuse me, but I am surprized to hear you talk in zuch a manner, and I must say, take it how you will, that I thought you had more sense."
Allworthy resented this reflection only with a smile; nor could he, if he would have endeavoured it, have conveyed into that smile any mixture of malice or contempt. His smiles at folly were indeed such as we may suppose the angels bestow on the absurdities of mankind.
Blifil now desired to be permitted to speak a few words. "As to using any violence on the young lady, I am sure I shall never consent to it. My conscience will not permit me to use violence on any one, much less on a lady for whom, however cruel she is to me, I shall always preserve the purest and sincerest affection; but yet I have read that women are seldom proof against perseverance. Why may I not hope then by such perseverance at last to gain those inclinations, in which for the future I shall, perhaps, have no rival; for as for this lord, Mr Western is so kind to prefer me to him; and sure, sir, you will not deny but that a parent hath at least a negative voice in these matters; nay, I have heard this very young lady herself say so more than once, and declare that she thought children inexcusable who married in direct opposition to the will of their parents. Besides, though the other ladies of the family seem to favour the pretensions of my lord, I do not find the lady herself is inclined to give him any countenance; alas! I am too well assured she is not; I am too sensible that wickedest of men remains uppermost in her heart."
"Ay, ay, so he does," cries Western.
"But surely," says Blifil, "when she hears of this murder which he hath committed, if the law should spare his life——"
"What's that?" cries Western. "Murder! hath he committed a murder, and is there any hopes of seeing him hanged?—Tol de rol, tol lol de rol." Here he fell a singing and capering about the room.
"Child," says Allworthy, "this unhappy passion of yours distresses me beyond measure. I heartily pity you, and would do every fair thing to promote your success."
"I desire no more," cries Blifil; "I am convinced my dear uncle hath a better opinion of me than to think that I myself would accept of more."
811
"Lookee," says Allworthy, "you have my leave to write, to visit, if she will permit it一but I insist on no thoughts of violence. I will have no confinement, nothing of that kind attempted."
"Well, well," cries the squire, "nothing of that kind shall be attempted; we will try a little longer what fair means will effect; and if this fellow be but hanged out of the way一Tol lol de rol! I never heard better news in my life一I warrant everything goes to my mind.一Do, prithee, dear Allworthy, come and dine with me at the Hercules Pillars: I have bespoke a shoulder of mutton roasted, and a spare-rib of pork, and a fowl and eggsauce. There will be nobody but ourselves, unless we have a mind to have the landlord; for I have sent Parson Supple down to Basingstoke after my tobacco-box, which I left at an inn there, and I would not lose it for the world; for it is an old acquaintance of above twenty years' standing. I can tell you landlord is a vast comical bitch, you will like un hugely."
Mr Allworthy at last agreed to this invitation, and soon after the squire went off, singing and capering at the hopes of seeing the speedy tragical end of poor Jones.
When he was gone, Mr Allworthy resumed the aforesaid subject with much gravity. He told his nephew, "He wished with all his heart he would endeavour to conquer a passion, in which I cannot," says he, "flatter you with any hopes of succeeding. It is certainly a vulgar error, that aversion in a woman may be conquered by perseverance. Indifference may, perhaps, sometimes yield to it; but the usual triumphs gained by perseverance in a lover are over caprice, prudence, affectation, and often an exorbitant degree of levity, which excites women not over-warm in their constitutions to indulge their vanity by prolonging the time of courtship, even when they are well enough pleased with the object, and resolve (if they ever resolve at all) to make him a very pitiful amends in the end. But a fixed dislike, as I am afraid this is, will rather gather strength than be conquered by time. Besides, my dear, I have another apprehension which you must excuse. I am afraid this passion which you have for this fine young creature hath her beautiful person too much for its object, and is unworthy of the name of that love which is the only foundation of matrimonial felicity. To admire, to like, and to long for the possession of a beautiful woman, without any regard to her sentiments towards us, is, I am afraid, too natural; but love, I believe, is the child of love only; at least, I am pretty confident that to love the creature who we are assured hates us is not in human nature. Examine your heart, therefore, thoroughly, my good boy, and if, upon examination, you have but
812
the least suspicion of this kind, I am sure your own virtue and religion will impel you to drive so vicious a passion from your heart, and your good sense will soon enable you to do it without pain."
The reader may pretty well guess Blifil's answer; but, if he should be at a loss, we are not at present at leisure to satisfy him, as our history now hastens on to matters of higher importance, and we can no longer bear to be absent from Sophia.
813
An extraordinary scene between Sophia and her aunt.
The lowing heifer and the bleating ewe, in herds and flocks, may ramble safe and unregarded through the pastures. These are, indeed, hereafter doomed to be the prey of man; yet many years are they suffered to enjoy their liberty undisturbed. But if a plump doe be discovered to have escaped from the forest, and to repose herself in some field or grove, the whole parish is presently alarmed, every man is ready to set his dogs after her; and, if she is preserved from the rest by the good squire, it is only that he may secure her for his own eating.
I have often considered a very fine young woman of fortune and fashion, when first found strayed from the pale of her nursery, to be in pretty much the same situation with this doe. The town is immediately in an uproar; she is hunted from park to play, from court to assembly, from assembly to her own chamber, and rarely escapes a single season from the jaws of some devourer or other; for, if her friends protect her from some, it is only to deliver her over to one of their own chusing, often more disagreeable to her than any of the rest; while whole herds or flocks of other women securely, and scarce regarded, traverse the park, the play, the opera, and the assembly; and though, for the most part at least, they are at last devoured, yet for a long time do they wanton in liberty, without disturbance or controul.
Of all these paragons none ever tasted more of this persecution than poor Sophia. Her ill stars were not contented with all that she had suffered on account of Blifil, they now raised her another pursuer, who seemed likely to torment her no less than the other had done. For though her aunt was less violent, she was no less assiduous in teizing her, than her father had been before.
The servants were no sooner departed after dinner than Mrs Western, who had opened the matter to Sophia, informed her, "That she expected his lordship that very afternoon, and intended to take the first
814
opportunity of leaving her alone with him." "If you do, madam," answered Sophia, with some spirit, "I shall take the first opportunity of leaving him by himself." "How! madam!" cries the aunt; "is this the return you make me for my kindness in relieving you from your confinement at your father's?" "You know, madam," said Sophia, "the cause of that confinement was a refusal to comply with my father in accepting a man I detested; and will my dear aunt, who hath relieved me from that distress, involve me in another equally bad?" "And do you think then, madam," answered Mrs Western, "that there is no difference between my Lord Fellamar and Mr Blifil?" "Very little, in my opinion," cries Sophia; "and, if I must be condemned to one, I would certainly have the merit of sacrificing myself to my father's pleasure." "Then my pleasure, I find," said the aunt, "hath very little weight with you; but that consideration shall not move me. I act from nobler motives. The view of aggrandizing my family, of ennobling yourself, is what I proceed upon. Have you no sense of ambition? Are there no charms in the thoughts of having a coronet on your coach?" "None, upon my honour," said Sophia. "A pincushion upon my coach would please me just as well." "Never mention honour," cries the aunt. "It becomes not the mouth of such a wretch. I am sorry, niece, you force me to use these words, but I cannot bear your groveling temper; you have none of the blood of the Westerns in you. But, however mean and base your own ideas are, you shall bring no imputation on mine. I will never suffer the world to say of me that I encouraged you in refusing one of the best matches in England; a match which, besides its advantage in fortune, would do honour to almost any family, and hath, indeed, in title, the advantage of ours." "Surely," says Sophia, "I am born deficient, and have not the senses with which other people are blessed; there must be certainly some sense which can relish the delights of sound and show, which I have not; for surely mankind would not labour so much, nor sacrifice so much for the obtaining, nor would they be so elate and proud with possessing, what appeared to them, as it doth to me, the most insignificant of all trifles."
"No, no, miss," cries the aunt; "you are born with as many senses as other people; but I assure you you are not born with a sufficient understanding to make a fool of me, or to expose my conduct to the world; so I declare this to you, upon my word, and you know, I believe, how fixed my resolutions are, unless you agree to see his lordship this afternoon, I will, with my own hands, deliver you to-morrow morning to my brother, and will never henceforth interfere with you, nor see your face again." Sophia stood a few moments silent after this speech, which was uttered
815
in a most angry and peremptory tone; and then, bursting into tears, she cryed, "Do with me, madam, whatever you please; I am the most miserable undone wretch upon earth; if my dear aunt forsakes me where shall I look for a protector?" "My dear niece," cries she, "you will have a very good protector in his lordship; a protector whom nothing but a hankering after that vile fellow Jones can make you decline." "Indeed, madam," said Sophia, "you wrong me. How can you imagine, after what you have shewn me, if I had ever any such thoughts, that I should not banish them for ever? If it will satisfy you, I will receive the sacrament upon it never to see his face again." "But, child, dear child," said the aunt, "be reasonable; can you invent a single objection?" "I have already, I think, told you a sufficient objection," answered Sophia. "What?" cries the aunt; "I remember none." "Sure, madam," said Sophia, "I told you he had used me in the rudest and vilest manner." "Indeed, child," answered she, "I never heard you, or did not understand you:—but what do you mean by this rude, vile manner?" "Indeed, madam," said Sophia, "I am almost ashamed to tell you. He caught me in his arms, pulled me down upon the settee, and thrust his hand into my bosom, and kissed it with such violence that I have the mark upon my left breast at this moment." "Indeed!" said Mrs Western. "Yes, indeed, madam," answered Sophia; "my father luckily came in at that instant, or Heaven knows what rudeness he intended to have proceeded to." "I am astonished and confounded," cries the aunt. "No woman of the name of Western hath been ever treated so since we were a family. I would have torn the eyes of a prince out, if he had attempted such freedoms with me. It is impossible! sure, Sophia, you must invent this to raise my indignation against him." "I hope, madam," said Sophia, "you have too good an opinion of me to imagine me capable of telling an untruth. Upon my soul it is true." "I should have stabbed him to the heart, had I been present," returned the aunt. "Yet surely he could have no dishonourable design; it is impossible! he durst not: besides, his proposals shew he hath not; for they are not only honourable, but generous. I don't know; the age allows too great freedoms. A distant salute is all I would have allowed before the ceremony. I have had lovers formerly, not so long ago neither; several lovers, though I never would consent to marriage, and I never encouraged the least freedom. It is a foolish custom, and what I never would agree to. No man kissed more of me than my cheek. It is as much as one can bring oneself to give lips up to a husband; and, indeed, could I ever have been persuaded to marry, I believe I should not have soon been brought to endure so much." "You will pardon me, dear madam," said Sophia, "if I
816
make one observation: you own you have had many lovers, and the world knows it, even if you should deny it. You refused them all, and, I am convinced, one coronet at least among them." "You say true, dear Sophy," answered she; "I had once the offer of a title." "Why, then," said Sophia, "will you not suffer me to refuse this once?" "It is true, child," said she, "I have refused the offer of a title; but it was not so good an offer; that is, not so very, very good an offer."一"Yes, madam," said Sophia; "but you have had very great proposals from men of vast fortunes. It was not the first, nor the second, nor the third advantageous match that offered itself." "I own it was not," said she. "Well, madam," continued Sophia, "and why may not I expect to have a second, perhaps, better than this? You are now but a young woman, and I am convinced would not promise to yield to the first lover of fortune, nay, or of title too. I am a very young woman, and sure I need not despair." "Well, my dear, dear Sophy," cries the aunt, "what would you have me say?" "Why, I only beg that I may not be left alone, at least this evening; grant me that, and I will submit, if you think, after what is past, I ought to see him in your company." "Well, I will grant it," cries the aunt. "Sophy, you know I love you, and can deny you nothing. You know the easiness of my nature; I have not always been so easy. I have been formerly thought cruel; by the men, I mean. I was called the cruel Parthenissa. I have broke many a window that has had verses to the cruel Parthenissa in it. Sophy, I was never so handsome as you, and yet I had something of you formerly. I am a little altered. Kingdoms and states, as Tully Cicero says in his epistles, undergo alterations, and so must the human form." Thus run she on for near half an hour upon herself, and her conquests, and her cruelty, till the arrival of my lord, who, after a most tedious visit, during which Mrs Western never once offered to leave the room, retired, not much more satisfied with the aunt than with the niece; for Sophia had brought her aunt into so excellent a temper, that she consented to almost everything her niece said; and agreed that a little distant behaviour might not be improper to so forward a lover.
Thus Sophia, by a little well-directed flattery, for which surely none will blame her, obtained a little ease for herself, and, at least, put off the evil day. And now we have seen our heroine in a better situation than she hath been for a long time before, we will look a little after Mr Jones, whom we left in the most deplorable situation that can be well imagined.

Chapter U
Mrs Miller and Mr Nightingale visit Jones in the prison.
When Mr Allworthy and his nephew went to meet Mr Western, Mrs Miller set forwards to her son-in-law's lodgings, in order to acquaint him with the accident which had befallen his friend Jones; but he had known it long before from Partridge (for Jones, when he left Mrs Miller, had been furnished with a room in the same house with Mr Nightingale). The good woman found her daughter under great affliction on account of Mr Jones, whom having comforted as well as she could, she set forwards to the Gatehouse, where she heard he was, and where Mr Nightingale was arrived before her.
The firmness and constancy of a true friend is a circumstance so extremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress, that the distress itself, if it be only temporary, and admits of relief, is more than compensated by bringing this comfort with it. Nor are instances of this kind so rare as some superficial and inaccurate observers have reported. To say the truth, want of compassion is not to be numbered among our general faults. The black ingredient which fouls our disposition is envy. Hence our eye is seldom, I am afraid, turned upward to those who are manifestly greater, better, wiser, or happier than ourselves, without some degree of malignity; while we commonly look downwards on the mean and miserable with sufficient benevolence and pity. In fact, I have remarked, that most of the defects which have discovered themselves in the friendships within my observation have arisen from envy only: a hellish vice; and yet one from which I have known very few absolutely exempt. But enough of a subject which, if pursued, would lead me too far.
Whether it was that Fortune was apprehensive lest Jones should sink under the weight of his adversity, and that she might thus lose any future opportunity of tormenting him, or whether she really abated somewhat of her severity towards him, she seemed a little to relax her persecution, by sending him the company of two such faithful friends, and
818
what is perhaps more rare, a faithful servant. For Partridge, though he had many imperfections, wanted not fidelity; and though fear would not suffer him to be hanged for his master, yet the world, I believe, could not have bribed him to desert his cause.
While Jones was expressing great satisfaction in the presence of his friends, Partridge brought an account that Mr Fitzpatrick was still alive, though the surgeon declared that he had very little hopes. Upon which, Jones fetching a deep sigh, Nightingale said to him, "My dear Tom, why should you afflict yourself so upon an accident, which, whatever be the consequence, can be attended with no danger to you, and in which your conscience cannot accuse you of having been the least to blame? If the fellow should die, what have you done more than taken away the life of a ruffian in your own defence? So will the coroner's inquest certainly find it; and then you will be easily admitted to bail; and, though you must undergo the form of a trial, yet it is a trial which many men would stand for you for a shilling." "Come, come, Mr Jones," says Mrs Miller, "chear yourself up. I knew you could not be the aggressor, and so I told Mr Allworthy, and so he shall acknowledge too, before I have done with him."
Jones gravely answered, "That whatever might be his fate, he should always lament the having shed the blood of one of his fellow-creatures, as one of the highest misfortunes which could have befallen him. But I have another misfortune of the tenderest kind-------O! Mrs Miller, I have
lost what I held most dear upon earth." "That must be a mistress," said Mrs Miller; "but come, come; I know more than you imagine" (for indeed Partridge had blabbed all); "and I have heard more than you know. Matters go better, I promise you, than you think; and I would not give Blifil sixpence for all the chance which he hath of the lady."
"Indeed, my dear friend, indeed," answered Jones, "you are an entire stranger to the cause of my grief. If you was acquainted with the story, you would allow my case admitted of no comfort. I apprehend no danger from Blifil. I have undone myself." "Don't despair," replied Mrs Miller; "you know not what a woman can do; and if anything be in my power, I promise you I will do it to serve you. It is my duty. My son, my dear Mr Nightingale, who is so kind to tell me he hath obligations to you on the same account, knows it is my duty. Shall I go to the lady myself? I will say anything to her you would have me say."
"Thou best of women," cries Jones, taking her by the hand, "talk not of obligations to me;—but as you have been so kind to mention it, there is a
819
favour which, perhaps, may be in your power. I see you are acquainted with the lady (how you came by your information I know not), who sits, indeed, very near my heart. If you could contrive to deliver this (giving her a paper from his pocket), I shall for ever acknowledge your goodness."
"Give it me," said Mrs Miller. "If I see it not in her own possession before I sleep, may my next sleep be my last! Comfort yourself, my good young man! be wise enough to take warning from past follies, and I warrant all shall be well, and I shall yet see you happy with the most charming young lady in the world; for I so hear from every one she is."
"Believe me, madam," said he, "I do not speak the common cant of one in my unhappy situation. Before this dreadful accident happened, I had resolved to quit a life of which I was become sensible of the wickedness as well as folly. I do assure you, notwithstanding the disturbances I have unfortunately occasioned in your house, for which I heartily ask your pardon, I am not an abandoned profligate. Though I have been hurried into vices, I do not approve a vicious character, nor will I ever, from this moment, deserve it."
Mrs Miller expressed great satisfaction in these declarations, in the sincerity of which she averred she had an entire faith; and now the remainder of the conversation past in the joint attempts of that good woman and Mr Nightingale to cheer the dejected spirits of Mr Jones, in which they so far succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and satisfied than they found him; to which happy alteration nothing so much contributed as the kind undertaking of Mrs Miller to deliver his letter to Sophia, which he despaired of finding any means to accomplish; for when Black George produced the last from Sophia, he informed Partridge that she had strictly charged him, on pain of having it communicated to her father, not to bring her any answer. He was, moreover, not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate to Mr Allworthy himself in this good woman, who was, in reality, one of the worthiest creatures in the world.
After about an hour's visit from the lady (for Nightingale had been with him much longer), they both took their leave, promising to return to him soon; during which Mrs Miller said she hoped to bring him some good news from his mistress, and Mr Nightingale promised to enquire into the state of Mr Fitzpatrick's wound, and likewise to find out some of the persons who were present at the rencounter.
820
The former of these went directly in quest of Sophia, whither we likewise shall now attend her.
821

In which Mrs Miller pays a visit to Sophia.
Access to the young lady was by no means difficult; for, as she lived now on a perfect friendly footing with her aunt, she was at full liberty to receive what visitants she pleased.
Sophia was dressing when she was acquainted that there was a gentlewoman below to wait on her. As she was neither afraid, nor ashamed, to see any of her own sex, Mrs Miller was immediately admitted.
Curtsies and the usual ceremonials between women who are strangers to each other, being past, Sophia said, "I have not the pleasure to know you, madam." "No, madam," answered Mrs Miller, "and I must beg pardon for intruding upon you. But when you know what has induced me to give you this trouble, I hope----" "Pray, what is your business,
madam?" said Sophia, with a little emotion. "Madam, we are not alone," replied Mrs Miller, in a low voice. "Go out, Betty," said Sophia.
When Betty was departed, Mrs Miller said, "I was desired, madam, by a very unhappy young gentleman, to deliver you this letter." Sophia changed colour when she saw the direction, well knowing the hand, and after some hesitation, said一"I could not conceive, madam, from your appearance, that your business had been of such a nature.一Whomever you brought this letter from, I shall not open it. I should be sorry to entertain an unjust suspicion of any one; but you are an utter stranger to me."
"If you will have patience, madam," answered Mrs Miller, "I will acquaint you who I am, and how I came by that letter." "I have no curiosity, madam, to know anything," cries Sophia; "but I must insist on your delivering that letter back to the person who gave it you."
Mrs Miller then fell upon her knees, and in the most passionate terms implored her compassion; to which Sophia answered: "Sure, madam, it is surprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the behalf of this person. I would not think, madam"一"No, madam," says Mrs Miller, "you shall not think anything but the truth. I will tell you all, and you
822
will not wonder that I am interested. He is the best-natured creature that ever was born."一She then began and related the story of Mr Anderson.一After this she cried, "This, madam, this is his goodness; but I have much more tender obligations to him. He hath preserved my child."一Here, after shedding some tears, she related everything concerning that fact, suppressing only those circumstances which would have most reflected on her daughter, and concluded with saying, "Now, madam, you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for so kind, so good, so generous a young man; and sure he is the best and worthiest of all human beings."
The alterations in the countenance of Sophia had hitherto been chiefly to her disadvantage, and had inclined her complexion to too great paleness; but she now waxed redder, if possible, than vermilion, and cried, "I know not what to say; certainly what arises from gratitude cannot be blamed一But what service can my reading this letter do your friend, since I am resolved never-----" Mrs Miller fell again to her entreaties,
and begged to be forgiven, but she could not, she said, carry it back. "Well, madam," says Sophia, "I cannot help it, if you will force it upon me.一Certainly you may leave it whether I will or no." What Sophia meant, or whether she meant anything, I will not presume to determine; but Mrs Miller actually understood this as a hint, and presently laying the letter down on the table, took her leave, having first begged permission to wait again on Sophia; which request had neither assent nor denial.
The letter lay upon the table no longer than till Mrs Miller was out of sight; for then Sophia opened and read it.
This letter did very little service to his cause; for it consisted of little more than confessions of his own unworthiness, and bitter lamentations of despair, together with the most solemn protestations of his unalterable fidelity to Sophia, of which, he said, he hoped to convince her, if he had ever more the honour of being admitted to her presence; and that he could account for the letter to Lady Bellaston in such a manner, that, though it would not entitle him to her forgiveness, he hoped at least to obtain it from her mercy. And concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his thoughts than to marry Lady Bellaston.
Though Sophia read the letter twice over with great attention, his meaning still remained a riddle to her; nor could her invention suggest to her any means to excuse Jones. She certainly remained very angry with him, though indeed Lady Bellaston took up so much of her
823
resentment, that her gentle mind had but little left to bestow on any other person.
That lady was most unluckily to dine this very day with her aunt Western, and in the afternoon they were all three, by appointment, to go together to the opera, and thence to Lady Thomas Hatchet's drum. Sophia would have gladly been excused from all, but would not disoblige her aunt; and as to the arts of counterfeiting illness, she was so entirely a stranger to them, that it never once entered into her head. When she was drest, therefore, down she went, resolved to encounter all the horrors of the day, and a most disagreeable one it proved; for Lady Bella-ston took every opportunity very civilly and slily to insult her; to all which her dejection of spirits disabled her from making any return; and, indeed, to confess the truth, she was at the very best but an indifferent mistress of repartee.
Another misfortune which befel poor Sophia was the company of Lord Fellamar, whom she met at the opera, and who attended her to the drum. And though both places were too publick to admit of any particularities, and she was farther relieved by the musick at the one place, and by the cards at the other, she could not, however, enjoy herself in his company; for there is something of delicacy in women, which will not suffer them to be even easy in the presence of a man whom they know to have pretensions to them which they are disinclined to favour.
Having in this chapter twice mentioned a drum, a word which our posterity, it is hoped, will not understand in the sense it is here applied, we shall, notwithstanding our present haste, stop a moment to describe the entertainment here meant, and the rather as we can in a moment describe it.
A drum, then, is an assembly of well-dressed persons of both sexes, most of whom play at cards, and the rest do nothing at all; while the mistress of the house performs the part of the landlady at an inn, and like the landlady of an inn prides herself in the number of her guests, though she doth not always, like her, get anything by it.
No wonder then, as so much spirits must be required to support any vivacity in these scenes of dulness, that we hear persons of fashion eternally complaining of the want of them; a complaint confined entirely to upper life. How insupportable must we imagine this round of impertinence to have been to Sophia at this time; how difficult must she have found it to force the appearance of gaiety into her looks, when her mind
824
dictated nothing but the tenderest sorrow, and when every thought was charged with tormenting ideas!
Night, however, at last restored her to her pillow, where we will leave her to soothe her melancholy at least, though incapable we fear of rest, and shall pursue our history, which, something whispers us, is now arrived at the eve of some great event.

Chapter /
A pathetic scene between Mr Allworthy and Mrs Miller.
Mrs Miller had a long discourse with Mr Allworthy, at his return from dinner, in which she acquainted him with Jones's having unfortunately lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their separation; and with the distresses to which that loss had subjected him; of all which she had received a full account from the faithful retailer Partridge. She then explained the obligations she had to Jones; not that she was entirely explicit with regard to her daughter; for though she had the utmost confidence in Mr Allworthy, and though there could be no hopes of keeping an affair secret which was unhappily known to more than half a dozen, yet she could not prevail with herself to mention those circumstances which reflected most on the chastity of poor Nancy, but smothered that part of her evidence as cautiously as if she had been before a judge, and the girl was now on her trial for the murder of a bastard.
Allworthy said, there were few characters so absolutely vicious as not to have the least mixture of good in them. "However," says he, "I cannot deny but that you have some obligations to the fellow, bad as he is, and I shall therefore excuse what hath past already, but must insist you never mention his name to me more; for, I promise you, it was upon the fullest and plainest evidence that I resolved to take the measures I have taken." "Well, sir," says she, "I make not the least doubt but time will shew all matters in their true and natural colours, and that you will be convinced this poor young man deserves better of you than some other folks that shall be nameless."
"Madam," cries Allworthy, a little ruffled, "I will not hear any reflections on my nephew; and if ever you say a word more of that kind, I will depart from your house that instant. He is the worthiest and best of men; and I once more repeat it to you, he hath carried his friendship to this man to a blameable length, by too long concealing facts of the blackest die. The ingratitude of the wretch to this good young man is what I most resent; for, madam, I have the greatest reason to imagine he had laid a
826
plot to supplant my nephew in my favour, and to have disinherited him."
"I am sure, sir," answered Mrs Miller, a little frightened (for, though Mr Allworthy had the utmost sweetness and benevolence in his smiles, he had great terror in his frowns), "I shall never speak against any gentleman you are pleased to think well of. I am sure, sir, such behaviour would very little become me, especially when the gentleman is your nearest relation; but, sir, you must not be angry with me, you must not indeed, for my good wishes to this poor wretch. Sure I may call him so now, though once you would have been angry with me if I had spoke of him with the least disrespect. How often have I heard you call him your son? How often have you prattled to me of him with all the fondness of a parent? Nay, sir, I cannot forget the many tender expressions, the many good things you have told me of his beauty, and his parts, and his virtues; of his good-nature and generosity. I am sure, sir, I cannot forget them, for I find them all true. I have experienced them in my own cause. They have preserved my family. You must pardon my tears, sir, indeed you must. When I consider the cruel reverse of fortune which this poor youth, to whom I am so much obliged, hath suffered; when I consider the loss of your favour, which I know he valued more than his life, I must, I must lament him. If you had a dagger in your hand, ready to plunge into my heart, I must lament the misery of one whom you have loved, and I shall ever love."
Allworthy was pretty much moved with this speech, but it seemed not to be with anger; for, after a short silence, taking Mrs Miller by the hand, he said very affectionately to her, "Come, madam, let us consider a little about your daughter. I cannot blame you for rejoicing in a match which promises to be advantageous to her, but you know this advantage, in a great measure, depends on the father's reconciliation. I know Mr Nightingale very well, and have formerly had concerns with him; I will make him a visit, and endeavour to serve you in this matter. I believe he is a worldly man; but as this is an only son, and the thing is now irretrievable, perhaps he may in time be brought to reason. I promise you I will do all I can for you."
Many were the acknowledgments which the poor woman made to Allworthy for this kind and generous offer, nor could she refrain from taking this occasion again to express her gratitude towards Jones, "to whom," said she, "I owe the opportunity of giving you, sir, this present trouble." Allworthy gently stopped her; but he was too good a man to be really offended with the effects of so noble a principle as now actuated
827
Mrs Miller; and indeed, had not this new affair inflamed his former anger against Jones, it is possible he might have been a little softened towards him, by the report of an action which malice itself could not have derived from an evil motive.
Mr Allworthy and Mrs Miller had been above an hour together, when their conversation was put an end to by the arrival of Blifil and another person, which other person was no less than Mr Dowling, the attorney, who was now become a great favourite with Mr Blifil, and whom Mr Allworthy, at the desire of his nephew, had made his steward; and had likewise recommended him to Mr Western, from whom the attorney received a promise of being promoted to the same office upon the first vacancy; and, in the meantime, was employed in transacting some affairs which the squire then had in London in relation to a mortgage.
This was the principal affair which then brought Mr Dowling to town; therefore he took the same opportunity to charge himself with some money for Mr Allworthy, and to make a report to him of some other business; in all which, as it was of much too dull a nature to find any place in this history, we will leave the uncle, nephew, and their lawyer concerned, and resort to other matters.
828

Chapter V?
Containing various matters.
Before we return to Mr Jones, we will take one more view of Sophia.
Though that young lady had brought her aunt into great good humour by those soothing methods which we have before related, she had not brought her in the least to abate of her zeal for the match with Lord Fel-lamar. This zeal was now inflamed by Lady Bellaston, who had told her the preceding evening, that she was well satisfied from the conduct of Sophia, and from her carriage to his lordship, that all delays would be dangerous, and that the only way to succeed was to press the match forward with such rapidity that the young lady should have no time to reflect, and be obliged to consent while she scarce knew what she did; in which manner, she said, one-half of the marriages among people of condition were brought about. A fact very probably true, and to which, I suppose, is owing the mutual tenderness which afterwards exists among so many happy couples.
A hint of the same kind was given by the same lady to Lord Fellamar; and both these so readily embraced the advice that the very next day was, at his lordship's request, appointed by Mrs Western for a private interview between the young parties. This was communicated to Sophia by her aunt, and insisted upon in such high terms, that, after having urged everything she possibly could invent against it without the least effect, she at last agreed to give the highest instance of complacence which any young lady can give, and consented to see his lordship.
As conversations of this kind afford no great entertainment, we shall be excused from reciting the whole that past at this interview; in which, after his lordship had made many declarations of the most pure and ardent passion to the silent blushing Sophia, she at last collected all the spirits she could raise, and with a trembling low voice said, "My lord, you must be yourself conscious whether your former behaviour to me hath been consistent with the professions you now make." "Is there,"
829
answered he, "no way by which I can atone for madness? what I did I am afraid must have too plainly convinced you, that the violence of love had deprived me of my senses." "Indeed, my lord," said she, "it is in your power to give me a proof of an affection which I much rather wish to encourage, and to which I should think myself more beholden." "Name it, madam," said my lord, very warmly. "My lord," says she, looking down upon her fan, "I know you must be sensible how uneasy this pretended passion of yours hath made me." "Can you be so cruel to call it pretended?" says he. "Yes, my lord," answered Sophia, "all professions of love to those whom we persecute are most insulting pretences. This pursuit of yours is to me a most cruel persecution: nay, it is taking a most ungenerous advantage of my unhappy situation." "Most lovely, most adorable charmer, do not accuse me," cries he, "of taking an ungenerous advantage, while I have no thoughts but what are directed to your honour and interest, and while I have no view, no hope, no ambition, but to throw myself, honour, fortune, everything at your feet." "My lord," says she, "it is that fortune and those honours which gave you the advantage of which I complain. These are the charms which have seduced my relations, but to me they are things indifferent. If your lordship will merit my gratitude, there is but one way." "Pardon me, divine creature," said he, "there can be none. All I can do for you is so much your due, and will give me so much pleasure, that there is no room for your gratitude." "Indeed, my lord," answered she, "you may obtain my gratitude, my good opinion, every kind thought and wish which it is in my power to bestow; nay, you may obtain them with ease, for sure to a generous mind it must be easy to grant my request. Let me beseech you, then, to cease a pursuit in which you can never have any success. For your own sake as well as mine I entreat this favour; for sure you are too noble to have any pleasure in tormenting an unhappy creature. What can your lordship propose but uneasiness to yourself, by a perseverance, which, upon my honour, upon my soul, cannot, shall not prevail with me, whatever distresses you may drive me to." Here my lord fetched a deep sigh, and then said一"Is it then, madam, that I am so unhappy to be the object of your dislike and scorn; or will you pardon me if I suspect there is some other?" Here he hesitated, and Sophia answered with some spirit, "My lord, I shall not be accountable to you for the reasons of my conduct. I am obliged to your lordship for the generous offer you have made; I own it is beyond either my deserts or expectations; yet I hope, my lord, you will not insist on my reasons, when I declare I cannot accept it." Lord Fellamar returned much to this, which we do not perfectly
830
understand, and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconciled either to sense or grammar; but he concluded his ranting speech with saying, "That if she had pre-engaged herself to any gentleman, however unhappy it would make him, he should think himself bound in honour to desist." Perhaps my lord laid too much emphasis on the word gentleman; for we cannot else well account for the indignation with which he inspired Sophia, who, in her answer, seemed greatly to resent some affront he had given her.
While she was speaking, with her voice more raised than usual, Mrs Western came into the room, the fire glaring in her cheeks, and the flames bursting from her eyes. "I am ashamed," says she, "my lord, of the reception which you have met with. I assure your lordship we are all sensible of the honour done us; and I must tell you, Miss Western, the family expect a different behaviour from you." Here my lord interfered on behalf of the young lady, but to no purpose; the aunt proceeded till Sophia pulled out her handkerchief, threw herself into a chair, and burst into a violent fit of tears.
The remainder of the conversation between Mrs Western and his lordship, till the latter withdrew, consisted of bitter lamentations on his side, and on hers of the strongest assurances that her niece should and would consent to all he wished. "Indeed, my lord," says she, "the girl hath had a foolish education, neither adapted to her fortune nor her family. Her father, I am sorry to say it, is to blame for everything. The girl hath silly country notions of bashfulness. Nothing else, my lord, upon my honour; I am convinced she hath a good understanding at the bottom, and will be brought to reason."
This last speech was made in the absence of Sophia; for she had some time before left the room, with more appearance of passion than she had ever shown on any occasion; and now his lordship, after many expressions of thanks to Mrs Western, many ardent professions of passion which nothing could conquer, and many assurances of perseverance, which Mrs Western highly encouraged, took his leave for this time.
Before we relate what now passed between Mrs Western and Sophia, it may be proper to mention an unfortunate accident which had happened, and which had occasioned the return of Mrs Western with so much fury, as we have seen.
The reader then must know that the maid who at present attended on Sophia was recommended by Lady Bellaston, with whom she had lived for some time in the capacity of a comb-brush: she was a very sensible
831
girl, and had received the strictest instructions to watch her young lady very carefully. These instructions, we are sorry to say, were communicated to her by Mrs Honour, into whose favour Lady Bellaston had now so ingratiated herself, that the violent affection which the good waitingwoman had formerly borne to Sophia was entirely obliterated by that great attachment which she had to her new mistress.
Now, when Mrs Miller was departed, Betty (for that was the name of the girl), returning to her young lady, found her very attentively engaged in reading a long letter, and the visible emotions which she betrayed on that occasion might have well accounted for some suspicions which the girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a stronger foundation, for she had overheard the whole scene which passed between Sophia and Mrs Miller.
Mrs Western was acquainted with all this matter by Betty, who, after receiving many commendations and some rewards for her fidelity, was ordered, that, if the woman who brought the letter came again, she should introduce her to Mrs Western herself.
Unluckily, Mrs Miller returned at the very time when Sophia was engaged with his lordship. Betty, according to order, sent her directly to the aunt; who, being mistress of so many circumstances relating to what had past the day before, easily imposed upon the poor woman to believe that Sophia had communicated the whole affair; and so pumped everything out of her which she knew relating to the letter and relating to Jones.
This poor creature might, indeed, be called simplicity itself. She was one of that order of mortals who are apt to believe everything which is said to them; to whom nature hath neither indulged the offensive nor defensive weapons of deceit, and who are consequently liable to be imposed upon by any one who will only be at the expense of a little falshood for that purpose. Mrs Western, having drained Mrs Miller of all she knew, which, indeed, was but little, but which was sufficient to make the aunt suspect a great deal, dismissed her with assurances that Sophia would not see her, that she would send no answer to the letter, nor ever receive another; nor did she suffer her to depart without a handsome lecture on the merits of an office to which she could afford no better name than that of procuress.—This discovery had greatly discomposed her temper, when, coming into the apartment next to that in which the lovers were, she overheard Sophia very warmly protesting against his lordship's addresses. At which the rage already kindled burst forth, and
832
she rushed in upon her niece in a most furious manner, as we have already described, together with what past at that time till his lordship's departure.
No sooner was Lord Fellamar gone than Mrs Western returned to Sophia, whom she upbraided in the most bitter terms for the ill use she had made of the confidence reposed in her; and for her treachery in conversing with a man with whom she had offered but the day before to bind herself in the most solemn oath never more to have any conversation. Sophia protested she had maintained no such conversation. "How, how! Miss Western," said the aunt; "will you deny your receiving a letter from him yesterday?" "A letter, madam!" answered Sophia, somewhat surprized. "It is not very well bred, miss," replies the aunt, "to repeat my words. I say a letter, and I insist upon your showing it me immediately." "I scorn a lie, madam," said Sophia; "I did receive a letter, but it was without my desire, and, indeed, I may say, against my consent." "Indeed, indeed, miss," cries the aunt, "you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at all; but where is the letter? for I will see it."
To this peremptory demand, Sophia paused some time before she returned an answer; and at last only excused herself by declaring she had not the letter in her pocket, which was, indeed, true; upon which her aunt, losing all manner of patience, asked her niece this short question, whether she would resolve to marry Lord Fellamar, or no? to which she received the strongest negative. Mrs Western then replied with an oath, or something very like one, that she would early the next morning deliver her back into her father's hand.
Sophia then began to reason with her aunt in the following man-ner:一"Why, madam, must I of necessity be forced to marry at all? Consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own case, and how much kinder your parents were in leaving you to your liberty. What have I done to forfeit this liberty? I will never marry contrary to my father's consent, nor without asking yours--And when I ask the con-
sent of either improperly, it will be then time enough to force some other marriage upon me." "Can I bear to hear this," cries Mrs Western, "from a girl who hath now a letter from a murderer in her pocket?" "I have no such letter, I promise you," answered Sophia; "and, if he be a murderer, he will soon be in no condition to give you any further disturbance." "How, Miss Western!" said the aunt, "have you the assurance to speak of him in this manner; to own your affection for such a villain to my face?" "Sure, madam," said Sophia, "you put a very strange construction on my words." "Indeed, Miss Western," cries the lady, "I shall not bear this
833
usage; you have learnt of your father this manner of treating me; he hath taught you to give me the lie. He hath totally ruined you by this false system of education; and, please heaven, he shall have the comfort of its fruits; for once more I declare to you, that to-morrow morning I will carry you back. I will withdraw all my forces from the field, and remain henceforth, like the wise king of Prussia, in a state of perfect neutrality. You are both too wise to be regulated by my measures; so prepare yourself, for to-morrow morning you shall evacuate this house."
Sophia remonstrated all she could; but her aunt was deaf to all she said. In this resolution therefore we must at present leave her, as there seems to be no hopes of bringing her to change it.

Chapter J
What happened to Mr Jones in the prison.
Mr Jones passed about twenty-four melancholy hours by himself, unless when relieved by the company of Partridge, before Mr Nightingale returned; not that this worthy young man had deserted or forgot his friend; for, indeed, he had been much the greatest part of the time employed in his service.
He had heard, upon enquiry, that the only persons who had seen the beginning of the unfortunate rencounter were a crew belonging to a man-of-war which then lay at Deptford. To Deptford therefore he went in search of this crew, where he was informed that the men he sought after were all gone ashore. He then traced them from place to place, till at last he found two of them drinking together, with a third person, at a hedge-tavern near Aldersgate.
Nightingale desired to speak with Jones by himself (for Partridge was in the room when he came in). As soon as they were alone, Nightingale, taking Jones by the hand, cried, "Come, my brave friend, be not too much dejected at what I am going to tell you----1 am sorry I am the
messenger of bad news; but I think it my duty to tell you." "I guess already what that bad news is," cries Jones. "The poor gentleman then is dead."一"I hope not," answered Nightingale. "He was alive this morning; though I will not flatter you; I fear, from the accounts I could get, that his wound is mortal. But if the affair be exactly as you told it, your own remorse would be all you would have reason to apprehend, let what would happen; but forgive me, my dear Tom, if I entreat you to make the worst of your story to your friends. If you disguise anything to us, you will only be an enemy to yourself."
"What reason, my dear Jack, have I ever given you," said Jones, "to stab me with so cruel a suspicion?" "Have patience," cries Nightingale, "and I will tell you all. After the most diligent enquiry I could make, I at last met with two of the fellows who were present at this unhappy accident,
835
and I am sorry to say, they do not relate the story so much in your favour as you yourself have told it." "Why, what do they say?" cries Jones. "Indeed what I am sorry to repeat, as I am afraid of the consequence of it to you. They say that they were at too great a distance to overhear any words that passed between you: but they both agree that the first blow was given by you." "Then, upon my soul," answered Jones, "they injure me. He not only struck me first, but struck me without the least provocation. What should induce those villains to accuse me falsely?" "Nay, that I cannot guess," said Nightingale, "and if you yourself, and I, who am so heartily your friend, cannot conceive a reason why they should belie you, what reason will an indifferent court of justice be able to assign why they should not believe them? I repeated the question to them several times, and so did another gentleman who was present, who, I believe, is a seafaring man, and who really acted a very friendly part by you; for he begged them often to consider that there was the life of a man in the case; and asked them over and over, if they were certain; to which they both answered, that they were, and would abide by their evidence upon oath. For heaven's sake, my dear friend, recollect yourself; for, if this should appear to be the fact, it will be your business to think in time of making the best of your interest. I would not shock you; but you know, I believe, the severity of the law, whatever verbal provocations may have been given you." "Alas! my friend," cries Jones, "what interest hath such a wretch as I? Besides, do you think I would even wish to live with the reputation of a murderer? If I had any friends (as, alas! I have none), could I have the confidence to solicit them to speak in the behalf of a man condemned for the blackest crime in human nature? Believe me, I have no such hope; but I have some reliance on a throne still greatly superior; which will, I am certain, afford me all the protection I merit."
He then concluded with many solemn and vehement protestations of the truth of what he had at first asserted.
The faith of Nightingale was now again staggered, and began to incline to credit his friend, when Mrs Miller appeared, and made a sorrowful report of the success of her embassy; which when Jones had heard, he cried out most heroically, "Well, my friend, I am now indifferent as to what shall happen, at least with regard to my life; and if it be the will of Heaven that I shall make an atonement with that for the blood I have spilt, I hope the Divine Goodness will one day suffer my honour to be cleared, and that the words of a dying man, at least, will be believed, so far as to justify his character."
836
A very mournful scene now past between the prisoner and his friends, at which, as few readers would have been pleased to be present, so few, I believe, will desire to hear it particularly related. We will, therefore, pass on to the entrance of the turnkey, who acquainted Jones that there was a lady without who desired to speak with him when he was at leisure.
Jones declared his surprize at this message. He said, "He knew no lady in the world whom he could possibly expect to see there." However, as he saw no reason to decline seeing any person, Mrs Miller and Mr Nightingale presently took their leave, and he gave orders to have the lady admitted.
If Jones was surprized at the news of a visit from a lady, how greatly was he astonished when he discovered this lady to be no other than Mrs Waters! In this astonishment then we shall leave him awhile, in order to cure the surprize of the reader, who will likewise, probably, not a little wonder at the arrival of this lady.
Who this Mrs Waters was, the reader pretty well knows; what she was, he must be perfectly satisfied. He will therefore be pleased to remember that this lady departed from Upton in the same coach with Mr Fitzpatrick and the other Irish gentleman, and in their company travelled to Bath.
Now there was a certain office in the gift of Mr Fitzpatrick at that time vacant, namely that of a wife: for the lady who had lately filled that office had resigned, or at least deserted her duty. Mr Fitzpatrick therefore, having thoroughly examined Mrs Waters on the road, found her extremely fit for the place, which, on their arrival at Bath, he presently conferred upon her, and she without any scruple accepted. As husband and wife this gentleman and lady continued together all the time they stayed at Bath, and as husband and wife they arrived together in town.
Whether Mr Fitzpatrick was so wise a man as not to part with one good thing till he had secured another, which he had at present only a prospect of regaining; or whether Mrs Waters had so well discharged her office, that he intended still to retain her as principal, and to make his wife (as is often the case) only her deputy, I will not say; but certain it is, he never mentioned his wife to her, never communicated to her the letter given him by Mrs Western, nor ever once hinted his purpose of repossessing his wife; much less did he ever mention the name of Jones. For, though he intended to fight with him wherever he met him, he did not imitate those prudent persons who think a wife, a mother, a sister, or sometimes a whole family, the safest seconds on these occasions. The
837
first account therefore which she had of all this was delivered to her from his lips, after he was brought home from the tavern where his wound had been drest.
As Mr Fitzpatrick, however, had not the clearest way of telling a story at any time, and was now, perhaps, a little more confused than usual, it was some time before she discovered that the gentleman who had given him this wound was the very same person from whom her heart had received a wound, which, though not of a mortal kind, was yet so deep that it had left a considerable scar behind it. But no sooner was she acquainted that Mr Jones himself was the man who had been committed to the Gatehouse for this supposed murder, than she took the first opportunity of committing Mr Fitzpatrick to the care of his nurse, and hastened away to visit the conqueror.
She now entered the room with an air of gaiety, which received an immediate check from the melancholy aspect of poor Jones, who started and blessed himself when he saw her. Upon which she said, "Nay, I do not wonder at your surprize; I believe you did not expect to see me; for few gentlemen are troubled here with visits from any lady, unless a wife. You see the power you have over me, Mr Jones. Indeed, I little thought, when we parted at Upton, that our next meeting would have been in such a place." "Indeed, madam," says Jones, "I must look upon this visit as kind; few will follow the miserable, especially to such dismal habitations." "I protest, Mr Jones," says she, "I can hardly persuade myself you are the same agreeable fellow I saw at Upton. Why, your face is more miserable than any dungeon in the universe. What can be the matter with you?" "I thought, madam," said Jones, "as you knew of my being here, you knew the unhappy reason." "Pugh!" says she, "you have pinked a man in a duel, that's all." Jones exprest some indignation at this levity, and spoke with the utmost contrition for what had happened. To which she answered, "Well, then, sir, if you take it so much to heart, I will relieve you; the gentleman is not dead, and, I am pretty confident, is in no danger of dying. The surgeon, indeed, who first dressed him was a young fellow, and seemed desirous of representing his case to be as bad as possible, that he might have the more honour from curing him: but the king's surgeon hath seen him since, and says, unless from a fever, of which there are at present no symptoms, he apprehends not the least danger of life." Jones shewed great satisfaction in his countenance at this report; upon which she affirmed the truth of it, adding, "By the most extraordinary accident in the world I lodge at the same house; and have seen the gentleman, and I promise you he doth you justice, and says,
838
whatever be the consequence, that he was entirely the aggressor, and that you was not in the least to blame."
Jones expressed the utmost satisfaction at the account which Mrs Waters brought him. He then informed her of many things which she well knew before, as who Mr Fitzpatrick was, the occasion of his resentment, &amp;c. He likewise told her several facts of which she was ignorant, as the adventure of the muff, and other particulars, concealing only the name of Sophia. He then lamented the follies and vices of which he had been guilty; every one of which, he said, had been attended with such ill consequences, that he should be unpardonable if he did not take warning, and quit those vicious courses for the future. He lastly concluded with assuring her of his resolution to sin no more, lest a worse thing should happen to him.
Mrs Waters with great pleasantry ridiculed all this, as the effects of low spirits and confinement. She repeated some witticisms about the devil when he was sick, and told him, "She doubted not but shortly to see him at liberty, and as lively a fellow as ever; and then," says she, "I don't question but your conscience will be safely delivered of all these qualms that it is now so sick in breeding."
Many more things of this kind she uttered, some of which it would do her no great honour, in the opinion of some readers, to remember; nor are we quite certain but that the answers made by Jones would be treated with ridicule by others. We shall therefore suppress the rest of this conversation, and only observe that it ended at last with perfect innocence, and much more to the satisfaction of Jones than of the lady; for the former was greatly transported with the news she had brought him; but the latter was not altogether so pleased with the penitential behaviour of a man whom she had, at her first interview, conceived a very different opinion of from what she now entertained of him.
Thus the melancholy occasioned by the report of Mr Nightingale was pretty well effaced; but the dejection into which Mrs Miller had thrown him still continued. The account she gave so well tallied with the words of Sophia herself in her letter, that he made not the least doubt but that she had disclosed his letter to her aunt, and had taken a fixed resolution to abandon him. The torments this thought gave him were to be equalled only by a piece of news which fortune had yet in store for him, and which we shall communicate in the second chapter of the ensuing book.

Chapter 且
A farewel to the reader.
We are now, reader, arrived at the last stage of our long journey. As we have, therefore, travelled together through so many pages, let us behave to one another like fellow-travellers in a stage coach, who have passed several days in the company of each other; and who, notwithstanding any bickerings or little animosities which may have occurred on the road, generally make all up at last, and mount, for the last time, into their vehicle with chearfulness and good humour; since after this one stage, it may possibly happen to us, as it commonly happens to them, never to meet more.
As I have here taken up this simile, give me leave to carry it a little farther. I intend, then, in this last book, to imitate the good company I have mentioned in their last journey. Now, it is well known that all jokes and raillery are at this time laid aside; whatever characters any of the passengers have for the jest-sake personated on the road are now thrown off, and the conversation is usually plain and serious.
In the same manner, if I have now and then, in the course of this work, indulged any pleasantry for thy entertainment, I shall here lay it down. The variety of matter, indeed, which I shall be obliged to cram into this book, will afford no room for any of those ludicrous observations which I have elsewhere made, and which may sometimes, perhaps, have prevented thee from taking a nap when it was beginning to steal upon thee. In this last book thou wilt find nothing (or at most very little) of that nature. All will be plain narrative only; and, indeed, when thou hast perused the many great events which this book will produce, thou wilt think the number of pages contained in it scarce sufficient to tell the story.
And now, my friend, I take this opportunity (as I shall have no other) of heartily wishing thee well. If I have been an entertaining companion to thee, I promise thee it is what I have desired. If in anything I have
841
offended, it was really without any intention. Some things, perhaps, here said, may have hit thee or thy friends; but I do most solemnly declare they were not pointed at thee or them. I question not but thou hast been told, among other stories of me, that thou wast to travel with a very scurrilous fellow; but whoever told thee so did me an injury. No man detests and despises scurrility more than myself; nor hath any man more reason; for none hath ever been treated with more; and what is a very severe fate, I have had some of the abusive writings of those very men fathered upon me, who, in other of their works, have abused me themselves with the utmost virulence.
All these works, however, I am well convinced, will be dead long before this page shall offer itself to thy perusal; for however short the period may be of my own performances, they will most probably outlive their own infirm author, and the weakly productions of his abusive contemporaries.

Chapter
Containing a very tragical incident.
While Jones was employed in those unpleasant meditations, with which we left him tormenting himself, Partridge came stumbling into the room with his face paler than ashes, his eyes fixed in his head, his hair standing an end, and every limb trembling. In short, he looked as he would have done had he seen a spectre, or had he, indeed, been a spectre himself.
Jones, who was little subject to fear, could not avoid being somewhat shocked at this sudden appearance. He did, indeed, himself change colour, and his voice a little faultered while he asked him, What was the matter?
"I hope, sir," said Partridge, "you will not be angry with me. Indeed I did not listen, but I was obliged to stay in the outward room. I am sure I wish I had been a hundred miles off, rather than have heard what I have heard." "Why, what is the matter?" said Jones. "The matter, sir? O good Heaven!" answered Partridge, "was that woman who is just gone out the woman who was with you at Upton?" "She was, Partridge," cried Jones. "And did you really, sir, go to bed with that woman?" said he, trem-bling.一"I am afraid what past between us is no secret," said Jones.一"Nay, but pray, sir, for Heaven's sake, sir, answer me," cries Partridge. "You know I did," cries Jones. "Why then, the Lord have mercy upon your soul, and forgive you," cries Partridge; "but as sure as I stand here alive, you have been a-bed with your own mother."
Upon these words Jones became in a moment a greater picture of horror than Partridge himself. He was, indeed, for some time struck dumb with amazement, and both stood staring wildly at each other. At last his words found way, and in an interrupted voice he said, "How! how! what's this you tell me?" "Nay, sir," cries Partridge, "I have not breath enough left to tell you now, but what I have said is most certainly true.一That woman who now went out is your own mother. How
843
unlucky was it for you, sir, that I did not happen to see her at that time, to have prevented it! Sure the devil himself must have contrived to bring about this wickedness."
"Sure," cries Jones, "Fortune will never have done with me till she hath driven me to distraction. But why do I blame Fortune? I am myself the cause of all my misery. All the dreadful mischiefs which have befallen me are the consequences only of my own folly and vice. What thou hast told me, Partridge, hath almost deprived me of my senses! And was Mrs Waters, then—but why do I ask? for thou must certainly know her一If thou hast any affection for me, nay, if thou hast any pity, let me beseech thee to fetch this miserable woman back again to me. O good Heavens! incest----with a mother! To what am I reserved!" He then fell into the
most violent and frantic agonies of grief and despair, in which Partridge declared he would not leave him; but at last, having vented the first torrent of passion, he came a little to himself; and then, having acquainted Partridge that he would find this wretched woman in the same house where the wounded gentleman was lodged, he despatched him in quest of her.
If the reader will please to refresh his memory, by turning to the scene at Upton, in the ninth book, he will be apt to admire the many strange accidents which unfortunately prevented any interview between Partridge and Mrs Waters, when she spent a whole day there with Mr Jones. Instances of this kind we may frequently observe in life, where the greatest events are produced by a nice train of little circumstances; and more than one example of this may be discovered by the accurate eye, in this our history.
After a fruitless search of two or three hours, Partridge returned back to his master, without having seen Mrs Waters. Jones, who was in a state of desperation at his delay, was almost raving mad when he brought him his account. He was not long, however, in this condition before he received the following letter:
"SIR,
"Since I left you I have seen a gentleman, from whom I have learned something concerning you which greatly surprizes and affects me; but as I have not at present leisure to communicate a matter of such high importance, you must suspend your curiosity till our next meeting, which shall be the first moment I am able to see you. O, Mr Jones, little did I think, when I past that happy day at Upton, the reflection upon which is
844
like to embitter all my future life, who it was to whom I owed such perfect happiness. Believe me to be ever sincerely your unfortunate
"J. WATERS."
"P.S. I would have you comfort yourself as much as possible, for Mr Fitzpatrick is in no manner of danger; so that whatever other grievous crimes you may have to repent of, the guilt of blood is not among the number."
Jones having read the letter, let it drop (for he was unable to hold it, and indeed had scarce the use of any one of his faculties). Partridge took it up, and having received consent by silence, read it likewise; nor had it upon him a less sensible effect. The pencil, and not the pen, should describe the horrors which appeared in both their countenances. While they both remained speechless the turnkey entered the room, and, without taking any notice of what sufficiently discovered itself in the faces of them both, acquainted Jones that a man without desired to speak with him. This person was presently introduced, and was no other than Black George.
As sights of horror were not so usual to George as they were to the turnkey, he instantly saw the great disorder which appeared in the face of Jones. This he imputed to the accident that had happened, which was reported in the very worst light in Mr Western's family; he concluded, therefore, that the gentleman was dead, and that Mr Jones was in a fair way of coming to a shameful end. A thought which gave him much uneasiness; for George was of a compassionate disposition, and notwithstanding a small breach of friendship which he had been over-tempted to commit, was, in the main, not insensible of the obligations he had formerly received from Mr Jones.
The poor fellow, therefore, scarce refrained from a tear at the present sight. He told Jones he was heartily sorry for his misfortunes, and begged him to consider if he could be of any manner of service. "Perhaps, sir," said he, "you may want a little matter of money upon this occasion; if you do, sir, what little I have is heartily at your service."
Jones shook him very heartily by the hand, and gave him many thanks for the kind offer he had made; but answered, "He had not the least want of that kind." Upon which George began to press his services more eagerly than before. Jones again thanked him, with assurances that he wanted nothing which was in the power of any man living to give. "Come, come, my good master," answered George, "do not take the matter so much to heart. Things may end better than you imagine; to be sure
845
you an't the first gentleman who hath killed a man, and yet come off." "You are wide of the matter, George," said Partridge, "the gentleman is not dead, nor like to die. Don't disturb my master, at present, for he is troubled about a matter in which it is not in your power to do him any good." "You don't know what I may be able to do, Mr Partridge," answered George; "if his concern is about my young lady, I have some news to tell my master." "What do you say, Mr George?" cried Jones. "Hath anything lately happened in which my Sophia is concerned? My Sophia! how dares such a wretch as I mention her so profanely." "I hope she will be yours yet," answered George. "Why yes, sir, I have something to tell you about her. Madam Western hath just brought Madam Sophia home, and there hath been a terrible to do. I could not possibly learn the very right of it; but my master he hath been in a vast big passion, and so was Madam Western, and I heard her say, as she went out of doors into her chair, that she would never set her foot in master's house again. I don't know what's the matter, not I, but everything was very quiet when I came out; but Robin, who waited at supper, said he had never seen the squire for a long while in such good humour with young madam; that he kissed her several times, and swore she should be her own mistress, and he never would think of confining her any more. I thought this news would please you, and so I slipped out, though it was so late, to inform you of it." Mr Jones assured George that it did greatly please him; for though he should never more presume to lift his eyes toward that incomparable creature, nothing could so much relieve his misery as the satisfaction he should always have in hearing of her welfare.
The rest of the conversation which passed at the visit is not important enough to be here related. The reader will, therefore, forgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be pleased to hear how this great good-will of the squire towards his daughter was brought about.
Mrs Western, on her first arrival at her brother's lodging, began to set forth the great honours and advantages which would accrue to the family by the match with Lord Fellamar, which her niece had absolutely refused; in which refusal, when the squire took the part of his daughter, she fell immediately into the most violent passion, and so irritated and provoked the squire, that neither his patience nor his prudence could bear it any longer; upon which there ensued between them both so warm a bout at altercation, that perhaps the regions of Billingsgate never equalled it. In the heat of this scolding Mrs Western departed, and had consequently no leisure to acquaint her brother with the letter which
846
Sophia received, which might have possibly produced ill effects; but, to say truth, I believe it never once occurred to her memory at this time.
When Mrs Western was gone, Sophia, who had been hitherto silent, as well indeed from necessity as inclination, began to return the compliment which her father had made her, in taking her part against her aunt, by taking his likewise against the lady. This was the first time of her so doing, and it was in the highest degree acceptable to the squire. Again, he remembered that Mr Allworthy had insisted on an entire relinquishment of all violent means; and, indeed, as he made no doubt but that Jones would be hanged, he did not in the least question succeeding with his daughter by fair means; he now, therefore, once more gave a loose to his natural fondness for her, which had such an effect on the dutiful, grateful, tender, and affectionate heart of Sophia, that had her honour, given to Jones, and something else, perhaps, in which he was concerned, been removed, I much doubt whether she would not have sacrificed herself to a man she did not like, to have obliged her father. She promised him she would make it the whole business of her life to oblige him, and would never marry any man against his consent; which brought the old man so near to his highest happiness, that he was resolved to take the other step, and went to bed completely drunk.

Chapter U
Allworthy visits old Nightingale; with a strange discovery that he made on that occasion.
The morning after these things had happened, Mr Allworthy went, according to his promise, to visit old Nightingale, with whom his authority was so great, that, after having sat with him three hours, he at last prevailed with him to consent to see his son.
Here an accident happened of a very extraordinary kind; one indeed of those strange chances whence very good and grave men have concluded that Providence often interposes in the discovery of the most secret villany, in order to caution men from quitting the paths of honesty, however warily they tread in those of vice.
Mr Allworthy, at his entrance into Mr Nightingale's, saw Black George; he took no notice of him, nor did Black George imagine he had perceived him.
However, when their conversation on the principal point was over, Allworthy asked Nightingale, Whether he knew one George Seagrim, and upon what business he came to his house? "Yes," answered Nightingale, "I know him very well, and a most extraordinary fellow he is, who, in these days, hath been able to hoard up £500 from renting a very small estate of £30 a year." "And is this the story which he hath told you?" cries Allworthy. "Nay, it is true, I promise you," said Nightingale, "for I have the money now in my own hands, in five bank-bills, which I am to lay out either in a mortgage, or in some purchase in the north of England." The bank-bills were no sooner produced at Allworthy's desire than he blessed himself at the strangeness of the discovery. He presently told Nightingale that these bank-bills were formerly his, and then acquainted him with the whole affair. As there are no men who complain more of the frauds of business than highwaymen, gamesters, and other thieves of that kind, so there are none who so bitterly exclaim against the frauds of gamesters, &amp;c., as usurers, brokers, and other thieves of this kind;
848
whether it be that the one way of cheating is a discountenance or reflection upon the other, or that money, which is the common mistress of all cheats, makes them regard each other in the light of rivals; but Nightingale no sooner heard the story than he exclaimed against the fellow in terms much severer than the justice and honesty of Allworthy had bestowed on him.
Allworthy desired Nightingale to retain both the money and the secret till he should hear farther from him; and, if he should in the meantime see the fellow, that he would not take the least notice to him of the discovery which he had made. He then returned to his lodgings, where he found Mrs Miller in a very dejected condition, on account of the information she had received from her son-in-law. Mr Allworthy, with great chearfulness, told her that he had much good news to communicate; and, with little further preface, acquainted her that he had brought Mr Nightingale to consent to see his son, and did not in the least doubt to effect a perfect reconciliation between them; though he found the father more sowered by another accident of the same kind which had happened in his family. He then mentioned the running away of the uncle's daughter, which he had been told by the old gentleman, and which Mrs Miller and her son-in-law did not yet know.
The reader may suppose Mrs Miller received this account with great thankfulness, and no less pleasure; but so uncommon was her friendship to Jones, that I am not certain whether the uneasiness she suffered for his sake did not overbalance her satisfaction at hearing a piece of news tending so much to the happiness of her own family; nor whether even this very news, as it reminded her of the obligations she had to Jones, did not hurt as well as please her; when her grateful heart said to her, "While my own family is happy, how miserable is the poor creature to whose generosity we owe the beginning of all this happiness!"
Allworthy, having left her a little while to chew the cud (if I may use that expression) on these first tidings, told her he had still something more to impart, which he believed would give her pleasure. "I think," said he, "I have discovered a pretty considerable treasure belonging to the young gentleman, your friend; but perhaps, indeed, his present situation may be such that it will be of no service to him." The latter part of the speech gave Mrs Miller to understand who was meant, and she answered with a sigh, "I hope not, sir." "I hope so too," cries Allworthy, "with all my heart; but my nephew told me this morning he had heard a very bad account of the affair."---"Good Heaven! sir," said she一"Well,
I must not speak, and yet it is certainly very hard to be obliged to hold
849
one's tongue when one hears."一"Madam," said Allworthy, "you may say whatever you please, you know me too well to think I have a prejudice against any one; and as for that young man, I assure you I should be heartily pleased to find he could acquit himself of everything, and particularly of this sad affair. You can testify the affection I have formerly borne him. The world, I know, censured me for loving him so much. I did not withdraw that affection from him without thinking I had the justest cause. Believe me, Mrs Miller, I should be glad to find I have been mistaken." Mrs Miller was going eagerly to reply, when a servant acquainted her that a gentleman without desired to speak with her immediately. Allworthy then enquired for his nephew, and was told that he had been for some time in his room with the gentleman who used to come to him, and whom Mr Allworthy guessing rightly to be Mr Dowling, he desired presently to speak with him.
When Dowling attended, Allworthy put the case of the bank-notes to him, without mentioning any name, and asked in what manner such a person might be punished. To which Dowling answered, "He thought he might be indicted on the Black Act; but said, as it was a matter of some nicety, it would be proper to go to counsel. He said he was to attend counsel presently upon an affair of Mr Western's, and if Mr Allworthy pleased he would lay the case before them." This was agreed to; and then Mrs Miller, opening the door, cried, "I ask pardon, I did not know you had company;" but Allworthy desired her to come in, saying he had finished his business. Upon which Mr Dowling withdrew, and Mrs Miller introduced Mr Nightingale the younger, to return thanks for the great kindness done him by Allworthy: but she had scarce patience to let the young gentleman finish his speech before she interrupted him, saying, "O sir! Mr Nightingale brings great news about poor Mr Jones: he hath been to see the wounded gentleman, who is out of all danger of death, and, what is more, declares he fell upon poor Mr Jones himself, and beat him. I am sure, sir, you would not have Mr Jones be a coward. If I was a man myself, I am sure, if any man was to strike me, I should draw my sword. Do pray, my dear, tell Mr Allworthy, tell him all yourself." Nightingale then confirmed what Mrs Miller had said; and concluded with many handsome things of Jones, who was, he said, one of the best-natured fellows in the world, and not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome. Here Nightingale was going to cease, when Mrs Miller again begged him to relate all the many dutiful expressions he had heard him make use of towards Mr Allworthy. "To say the utmost good of Mr Allworthy," cries Nightingale, "is doing no more than strict justice, and can
850
have no merit in it: but indeed, I must say, no man can be more sensible of the obligations he hath to so good a man than is poor Jones. Indeed, sir, I am convinced the weight of your displeasure is the heaviest burthen he lies under. He hath often lamented it to me, and hath as often protested in the most solemn manner he hath never been intentionally guilty of any offence towards you; nay, he hath sworn he would rather die a thousand deaths than he would have his conscience upbraid him with one disrespectful, ungrateful, or undutiful thought towards you. But I ask pardon, sir, I am afraid I presume to intermeddle too far in so tender a point." "You have spoke no more than what a Christian ought," cries Mrs Miller. "Indeed, Mr Nightingale," answered Allworthy, "I applaud your generous friendship, and I wish he may merit it of you. I confess I am glad to hear the report you bring from this unfortunate gentleman; and, if that matter should turn out to be as you represent it (and, indeed, I doubt nothing of what you say), I may, perhaps, in time, be brought to think better than lately I have of this young man; for this good gentlewoman here, nay, all who know me, can witness that I loved him as dearly as if he had been my own son. Indeed, I have considered him as a child sent by fortune to my care. I still remember the innocent, the helpless situation in which I found him. I feel the tender pressure of his little hands at this moment. He was my darling, indeed he was." At which words he ceased, and the tears stood in his eyes.
As the answer which Mrs Miller made may lead us into fresh matters, we will here stop to account for the visible alteration in Mr Allworthy's mind, and the abatement of his anger to Jones. Revolutions of this kind, it is true, do frequently occur in histories and dramatic writers, for no other reason than because the history or play draws to a conclusion, and are justified by authority of authors; yet, though we insist upon as much authority as any author whatever, we shall use this power very sparingly, and never but when we are driven to it by necessity, which we do not at present foresee will happen in this work.
This alteration then in the mind of Mr Allworthy was occasioned by a letter he had just received from Mr Square, and which we shall give the reader in the beginning of the next chapter.
851
Containing two letters in very different stiles.
"MY WORTHY FRIEND,一I informed you in my last that I was forbidden the use of the waters, as they were found by experience rather to increase than lessen the symptoms of my distemper. I must now acquaint you with a piece of news, which, I believe, will afflict my friends more than it hath afflicted me. Dr Harrington and Dr Brewster have informed me that there is no hopes of my recovery.
"I have somewhere read, that the great use of philosophy is to learn to die. I will not therefore so far disgrace mine as to shew any surprize at receiving a lesson which I must be thought to have so long studied. Yet, to say the truth, one page of the Gospel teaches this lesson better than all the volumes of antient or modern philosophers. The assurance it gives us of another life is a much stronger support to a good mind than all the consolations that are drawn from the necessity of nature, the emptiness or satiety of our enjoyments here, or any other topic of those declamations which are sometimes capable of arming our minds with a stubborn patience in bearing the thoughts of death, but never of raising them to a real contempt of it, and much less of making us think it is a real good. I would not here be understood to throw the horrid censure of atheism, or even the absolute denial of immortality, on all who are called philosophers. Many of that sect, as well antient as modern, have, from the light of reason, discovered some hopes of a future state; but in reality, that light was so faint and glimmering, and the hopes were so incertain and precarious, that it may be justly doubted on which side their belief turned. Plato himself concludes his Phaedon with declaring that his best arguments amount only to raise a probability; and Cicero himself seems rather to profess an inclination to believe, than any actual belief in the doctrines of immortality. As to myself, to be very sincere with you, I never was much in earnest in this faith till I was in earnest a Christian.
"You will perhaps wonder at the latter expression; but I assure you it hath not been till very lately that I could, with truth, call myself so. The
852
pride of philosophy had intoxicated my reason, and the sublimest of all wisdom appeared to me, as it did to the Greeks of old, to be foolishness. God hath, however, been so gracious to shew me my error in time, and to bring me into the way of truth, before I sunk into utter darkness forever.
"I find myself beginning to grow weak, I shall therefore hasten to the main purpose of this letter.
"When I reflect on the actions of my past life, I know of nothing which sits heavier upon my conscience than the injustice I have been guilty of to that poor wretch your adopted son. I have, indeed, not only connived at the villany of others, but been myself active in injustice towards him. Believe me, my dear friend, when I tell you, on the word of a dying man, he hath been basely injured. As to the principal fact, upon the misrepresentation of which you discarded him, I solemnly assure you he is innocent. When you lay upon your supposed deathbed, he was the only person in the house who testified any real concern; and what happened afterwards arose from the wildness of his joy on your recovery; and, I am sorry to say it, from the baseness of another person (but it is my desire to justify the innocent, and to accuse none). Believe me, my friend, this young man hath the noblest generosity of heart, the most perfect capacity for friendship, the highest integrity, and indeed every virtue which can ennoble a man. He hath some faults, but among them is not to be numbered the least want of duty or gratitude towards you. On the contrary, I am satisfied, when you dismissed him from your house, his heart bled for you more than for himself.
"Worldly motives were the wicked and base reasons of my concealing this from you so long; to reveal it now I can have no inducement but the desire of serving the cause of truth, of doing right to the innocent, and of making all the amends in my power for a past offence. I hope this declaration, therefore, will have the effect desired, and will restore this deserving young man to your favour; the hearing of which, while I am yet alive, will afford the utmost consolation to,
Sir, Your most obliged, obedient humble servant, THOMAS SQUARE."
The reader will, after this, scarce wonder at the revolution so visibly appearing in Mr Allworthy, notwithstanding he received from Thwack-um, by the same post, another letter of a very different kind, which we shall here add, as it may possibly be the last time we shall have occasion to mention the name of that gentleman.
853
"SIR,
"I am not at all surprized at hearing from your worthy nephew a fresh instance of the villany of Mr Square the atheist's young pupil. I shall not wonder at any murders he may commit; and I heartily pray that your own blood may not seal up his final commitment to the place of wailing and gnashing of teeth.
"Though you cannot want sufficient calls to repentance for the many unwarrantable weaknesses exemplified in your behaviour to this wretch, so much to the prejudice of your own lawful family, and of your character; I say, though these may sufficiently be supposed to prick and goad your conscience at this season, I should yet be wanting to my duty, if I spared to give you some admonition in order to bring you to a due sense of your errors. I therefore pray you seriously to consider the judgment which is likely to overtake this wicked villain; and let it serve at least as a warning to you, that you may not for the future despise the advice of one who is so indefatigable in his prayers for your welfare.
"Had not my hand been withheld from due correction, I had scourged much of this diabolical spirit out of a boy, of whom from his infancy I discovered the devil had taken such entire possession. But reflections of this kind now come too late.
"I am sorry you have given away the living of Westerton so hastily. I should have applied on that occasion earlier, had I thought you would not have acquainted me previous to the disposition.--Your objection
to pluralities is being righteous over-much. If there were any crime in the practice, so many godly men would not agree to it. If the vicar of Aldergrove should die (as we hear he is in a declining way), I hope you will think of me, since I am certain you must be convinced of my most sincere attachment to your highest welfare一a welfare to which all worldly considerations are as trifling as the small tithes mentioned in Scripture are, when compared to the weighty matters of the law.
I am, sir, Your faithful humble servant, ROGER THWACKUM."
This was the first time Thwackum ever wrote in this authoritative stile to Allworthy, and of this he had afterwards sufficient reason to repent, as in the case of those who mistake the highest degree of goodness for the lowest degree of weakness. Allworthy had indeed never liked this man. He knew him to be proud and ill-natured; he also knew that his divinity itself was tinctured with his temper, and such as in many respects he himself did by no means approve; but he was at the same time an excellent scholar, and most indefatigable in teaching the two lads. Add to
854
this, the strict severity of his life and manners, an unimpeached honesty, and a most devout attachment to religion. So that, upon the whole, though Allworthy did not esteem nor love the man, yet he could never bring himself to part with a tutor to the boys, who was, both by learning and industry, extremely well qualified for his office; and he hoped, that as they were bred up in his own house, and under his own eye, he should be able to correct whatever was wrong in Thwackum's instructions.

Chapter U
In which the history is continued.
Mr Allworthy, in his last speech, had recollected some tender ideas concerning Jones, which had brought tears into the good man's eyes. This Mrs Miller observing, said, "Yes, yes, sir, your goodness to this poor young man is known, notwithstanding all your care to conceal it; but there is not a single syllable of truth in what those villains said. Mr Nightingale hath now discovered the whole matter. It seems these fellows were employed by a lord, who is a rival of poor Mr Jones, to have pressed him on board a ship.—I assure them I don't know who they will press next. Mr Nightingale here hath seen the officer himself, who is a very pretty gentleman, and hath told him all, and is very sorry for what he undertook, which he would never have done, had he known Mr Jones to have been a gentleman; but he was told that he was a common strolling vagabond."
Allworthy stared at all this, and declared he was a stranger to every word she said. "Yes, sir," answered she, "I believe you are.-It is a very
different story, I believe, from what those fellows told this lawyer."
"What lawyer, madam? what is it you mean?" said Allworthy. "Nay, nay," said she, "this is so like you to deny your own goodness: but Mr Nightingale here saw him." "Saw whom, madam?" answered he. "Why, your lawyer, sir," said she, "that you so kindly sent to enquire into the affair." "I am still in the dark, upon my honour," said Allworthy. "Why then do you tell him, my dear sir," cries she. "Indeed, sir," said Nightingale, "I did see that very lawyer who went from you when I came into the room, at an alehouse in Aldersgate, in company with two of the fellows who were employed by Lord Fellamar to press Mr Jones, and who were by that means present at the unhappy rencounter between him and Mr Fitzpatrick." "I own, sir," said Mrs Miller, "when I saw this gentleman come into the room to you, I told Mr Nightingale that I apprehended you had sent him thither to inquire into the affair." Allworthy shewed marks of astonishment in his countenance at this news, and was indeed for two
856
or three minutes struck dumb by it. At last, addressing himself to Mr Nightingale, he said, "I must confess myself, sir, more surprized at what you tell me than I have ever been before at anything in my whole life. Are you certain this was the gentleman?" "I am most certain," answered Nightingale. "At Aldersgate?" cries Allworthy. "And was you in company with this lawyer and the two fellows?"一"I was, sir," said the other, "very near half an hour." "Well, sir," said Allworthy, "and in what manner did the lawyer behave? did you hear all that past between him and the fellows?" "No, sir," answered Nightingale, "they had been together before I came.一In my presence the lawyer said little; but, after I had several times examined the fellows, who persisted in a story directly contrary to what I had heard from Mr Jones, and which I find by Mr Fitzpatrick was a rank falshood, the lawyer then desired the fellows to say nothing but what was the truth, and seemed to speak so much in favour of Mr Jones, that, when I saw the same person with you, I concluded your goodness had prompted you to send him thither."一"And did you not send him thither?" says Mrs Miller.一"Indeed I did not," answered Allworthy; "nor did I know he had gone on such an errand till this moment."一"I see it all!" said Mrs Miller, "upon my soul, I see it all! No wonder they have been closeted so close lately. Son Nightingale, let me beg you run for these fellows immediately----find them out if they
are above-ground. I will go myself"一"Dear madam," said Allworthy, "be patient, and do me the favour to send a servant upstairs to call Mr Dowling hither, if he be in the house, or, if not, Mr Blifil." Mrs Miller went out muttering something to herself, and presently returned with an answer, "That Mr Dowling was gone; but that the t'other," as she called him, "was coming."
Allworthy was of a cooler disposition than the good woman, whose spirits were all up in arms in the cause of her friend. He was not however without some suspicions which were near akin to hers. When Blifil came into the room, he asked him with a very serious countenance, and with a less friendly look than he had ever before given him, "Whether he knew anything of Mr Dowling's having seen any of the persons who were present at the duel between Jones and another gentleman?"
There is nothing so dangerous as a question which comes by surprize on a man whose business it is to conceal truth, or to defend falshood. For which reason those worthy personages, whose noble office it is to save the lives of their fellow-creatures at the Old Bailey, take the utmost care, by frequent previous examination, to divine every question which may
857
be asked their clients on the day of tryal, that they may be supplyed with proper and ready answers, which the most fertile invention cannot supply in an instant. Besides, the sudden and violent impulse on the blood, occasioned by these surprizes, causes frequently such an alteration in the countenance, that the man is obliged to give evidence against himself. And such indeed were the alterations which the countenance of Blifil underwent from this sudden question, that we can scarce blame the eagerness of Mrs Miller, who immediately cryed out, "Guilty, upon my honour! guilty, upon my soul!"
Mr Allworthy sharply rebuked her for this impetuosity; and then turning to Blifil, who seemed sinking into the earth, he said, "Why do you hesitate, sir, at giving me an answer? You certainly must have employed him; for he would not, of his own accord, I believe, have undertaken such an errand, and especially without acquainting me."
Blifil then answered, "I own, sir, I have been guilty of an offence, yet may I hope your pardon?"一"My pardon," said Allworthy, very angrily.一"Nay, sir," answered Blifil, "I knew you would be offended; yet surely my dear uncle will forgive the effects of the most amiable of human weaknesses. Compassion for those who do not deserve it, I own is a crime; and yet it is a crime from which you yourself are not entirely free. I know I have been guilty of it in more than one instance to this very person; and I will own I did send Mr Dowling, not on a vain and fruitless enquiry, but to discover the witnesses, and to endeavour to soften their evidence. This, sir, is the truth; which, though I intended to conceal from you, I will not deny."
"I confess," said Nightingale, "this is the light in which it appeared to me from the gentleman's behaviour."
"Now, madam," said Allworthy, "I believe you will once in your life own you have entertained a wrong suspicion, and are not so angry with my nephew as you was."
Mrs Miller was silent; for, though she could not so hastily be pleased with Blifil, whom she looked upon to have been the ruin of Jones, yet in this particular instance he had imposed upon her as well as upon the rest; so entirely had the devil stood his friend. And, indeed, I look upon the vulgar observation, "That the devil often deserts his friends, and leaves them in the lurch," to be a great abuse on that gentleman's character. Perhaps he may sometimes desert those who are only his cup acquaintance; or who, at most, are but half his; but he generally stands by
858
those who are thoroughly his servants, and helps them off in all extremities, till their bargain expires.
As a conquered rebellion strengthens a government, or as health is more perfectly established by recovery from some diseases; so anger, when removed, often gives new life to affection. This was the case of Mr Allworthy; for Blifil having wiped off the greater suspicion, the lesser, which had been raised by Square's letter, sunk of course, and was forgotten; and Thwackum, with whom he was greatly offended, bore alone all the reflections which Square had cast on the enemies of Jones.
As for that young man, the resentment of Mr Allworthy began more and more to abate towards him. He told Blifil, "He did not only forgive the extraordinary efforts of his good-nature, but would give him the pleasure of following his example." Then, turning to Mrs Miller with a smile which would have become an angel, he cryed, "What say you, madam? shall we take a hackney-coach, and all of us together pay a visit to your friend? I promise you it is not the first visit I have made in a prison."
Every reader, I believe, will be able to answer for the worthy woman; but they must have a great deal of good-nature, and be well acquainted with friendship, who can feel what she felt on this occasion. Few, I hope, are capable of feeling what now passed in the mind of Blifil; but those who are will acknowledge that it was impossible for him to raise any objection to this visit. Fortune, however, or the gentleman lately mentioned above, stood his friend, and prevented his undergoing so great a shock; for at the very instant when the coach was sent for, Partridge arrived, and, having called Mrs Miller from the company, acquainted her with the dreadful accident lately come to light; and hearing Mr Allworthy's intention, begged her to find some means of stopping him: "For," says he, "the matter must at all hazards be kept a secret from him; and if he should now go, he will find Mr Jones and his mother, who arrived just as I left him, lamenting over one another the horrid crime they have ignorantly committed."
The poor woman, who was almost deprived of her senses at his dreadful news, was never less capable of invention than at present. However, as women are much readier at this than men, she bethought herself of an excuse, and, returning to Allworthy, said, "I am sure, sir, you will be surprized at hearing any objection from me to the kind proposal you just now made; and yet I am afraid of the consequence of it, if carried immediately into execution. You must imagine, sir, that all the calamities
859
which have lately befallen this poor young fellow must have thrown him into the lowest dejection of spirits; and now, sir, should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent fit of joy, as I know your presence will occasion, it may, I am afraid, produce some fatal mischief, especially as his servant, who is without, tells me he is very far from being well."
"Is his servant without?" cries Allworthy; "pray call him hither. I will ask him some questions concerning his master."
Partridge was at first afraid to appear before Mr Allworthy; but was at length persuaded, after Mrs Miller, who had often heard his whole story from his own mouth, had promised to introduce him.
Allworthy recollected Partridge the moment he came into the room, though many years had passed since he had seen him. Mrs Miller, therefore, might have spared here a formal oration, in which, indeed, she was something prolix; for the reader, I believe, may have observed already that the good woman, among other things, had a tongue always ready for the service of her friends.
"And are you," said Allworthy to Partridge, "the servant of Mr Jones?" "I can't say, sir," answered he, "that I am regularly a servant, but I live with him, an't please your honour, at present. Non sum qualis eram, as your honour very well knows."
Mr Allworthy then asked him many questions concerning Jones, as to his health, and other matters; to all which Partridge answered, without having the least regard to what was, but considered only what he would have things appear; for a strict adherence to truth was not among the articles of this honest fellow's morality or his religion.
During this dialogue Mr Nightingale took his leave, and presently after Mrs Miller left the room, when Allworthy likewise despatched Bli-fil; for he imagined that Partridge when alone with him would be more explicit than before company. They were no sooner left in private together than Allworthy began, as in the following chapter.
860

In which the history is farther continued
"Sure, friend," said the good man, "you are the strangest of all human beings. Not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately persisting in a falshood, but to persist in it thus to the last, and to pass thus upon the world for a servant of your own son! What interest can you have in all this? What can be your motive?"
"I see, sir," said Partridge, falling down upon his knees, "that your honour is prepossessed against me, and resolved not to believe anything I say, and, therefore, what signifies my protestations? but yet there is one above who knows that I am not the father of this young man."
"How!" said Allworthy, "will you yet deny what you was formerly convicted of upon such unanswerable, such manifest evidence? Nay, what a confirmation is your being now found with this very man, of all which twenty years ago appeared against you! I thought you had left the country! nay, I thought you had been long since dead.一In what manner did you know anything of this young man? Where did you meet with him, unless you had kept some correspondence together? Do not deny this; for I promise you it will greatly raise your son in my opinion, to find that he hath such a sense of filial duty as privately to support his father for so many years."
"If your honour will have patience to hear me," said Partridge, "I will tell you all."一Being bid go on, he proceeded thus: "When your honour conceived that displeasure against me, it ended in my ruin soon after; for I lost my little school; and the minister, thinking I suppose it would be agreeable to your honour, turned me out from the office of clerk; so that I had nothing to trust to but the barber's shop, which, in a country place like that, is a poor livelihood; and when my wife died (for till that time I received a pension of £12 a year from an unknown hand, which indeed I believe was your honour's own, for nobody that ever I heard of doth these things besides)一but, as I was saying, when she died, this pension
861
forsook me; so that now, as I owed two or three small debts, which began to be troublesome to me, particularly one 29 which an attorney brought up by law-charges from 15s. to near £30, and as I found all my usual means of living had forsook me, I packed up my little all as well as I could, and went off.
"The first place I came to was Salisbury, where I got into the service of a gentleman belonging to the law, and one of the best gentlemen that ever I knew, for he was not only good to me, but I know a thousand good and charitable acts which he did while I staid with him; and I have known him often refuse business because it was paultry and oppressive." "You need not be so particular," said Allworthy; "I know this gentleman, and a very worthy man he is, and an honour to his profession."一"Well, sir," continued Partridge, "from hence I removed to Lymington, where I was above three years in the service of another lawyer, who was likewise a very good sort of a man, and to be sure one of the merriest gentlemen in England. Well, sir, at the end of the three years I set up a little school, and was likely to do well again, had it not been for a most unlucky accident. Here I kept a pig; and one day, as ill fortune would have it, this pig broke out, and did a trespass, I think they call it, in a garden belonging to one of my neighbours, who was a proud, revengeful man, and employed a lawyer, one—one—I can't think of his name; but he sent for a writ against me, and had me to size. When I came there, Lord have mercy upon me一to hear what the counsellors said! There was one that told my lord a parcel of the confoundedest lies about me; he said that I used to drive my hogs into other folk's gardens, and a great deal more; and at last he said, he hoped I had at last brought my hogs to a fair market. To be sure, one would have thought that, instead of being owner only of one poor little pig, I had been the greatest hog-merchant in England. Well—" "Pray," said Allworthy, "do not be so particular, I have heard nothing of your son yet." "O it was a great many years," answered Partridge, "before I saw my son, as you are pleased to call him.--1 went
over to Ireland after this, and taught school at Cork (for that one suit ruined me again, and I lay seven years in Winchester jail)."—"Well," said Allworthy, "pass that over till your return to England."一"Then, sir," said
29.This is a fact which I knew happen to a poor clergyman in Dorsetshire, by the vil-lany of an attorney who, not contented with the exorbitant costs to which the poor man was put by a single action, brought afterwards another action on the judgment, as it was called. A method frequently used to oppress the poor, and bring money into the pockets of attorneys, to the great scandal of the law, of the nation, of Christianity, and even of human nature itself.
862
he, "it was about half a year ago that I landed at Bristol, where I staid some time, and not finding it do there, and hearing of a place between that and Gloucester where the barber was just dead, I went thither, and there I had been about two months when Mr Jones came thither." He then gave Allworthy a very particular account of their first meeting, and of everything, as well as he could remember, which had happened from that day to this; frequently interlarding his story with panegyrics on Jones, and not forgetting to insinuate the great love and respect which he had for Allworthy. He concluded with saying, "Now, sir, I have told your honour the whole truth." And then repeated a most solemn protestation, "That he was no more the father of Jones than of the Pope of Rome;" and imprecated the most bitter curses on his head, if he did not speak truth.
"What am I to think of this matter?" cries Allworthy. "For what purpose should you so strongly deny a fact which I think it would be rather your interest to own?" "Nay, sir," answered Partridge (for he could hold no longer), "if your honour will not believe me, you are like soon to have satisfaction enough. I wish you had mistaken the mother of this young man, as well as you have his father."一And now being asked what he meant, with all the symptoms of horror, both in his voice and countenance, he told Allworthy the whole story, which he had a little before expressed such desire to Mrs Miller to conceal from him.
Allworthy was almost as much shocked at this discovery as Partridge himself had been while he related it. "Good heavens!" says he, "in what miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men! How much beyond our designs are the effects of wickedness sometimes carried!" He had scarce uttered these words, when Mrs Waters came hastily and abruptly into the room. Partridge no sooner saw her than he cried, "Here, sir, here is the very woman herself. This is the unfortunate mother of Mr Jones. I am sure she will acquit me before your honour. Pray, madam-------"
Mrs Waters, without paying any regard to what Partridge said, and almost without taking any notice of him, advanced to Mr Allworthy. "I believe, sir, it is so long since I had the honour of seeing you, that you do not recollect me." "Indeed," answered Allworthy, "you are so very much altered, on many accounts, that had not this man already acquainted me who you are, I should not have immediately called you to my remembrance. Have you, madam, any particular business which brings you to me?" Allworthy spoke this with great reserve; for the reader may easily believe he was not well pleased with the conduct of this lady; neither
863
with what he had formerly heard, nor with what Partridge had now delivered.
Mrs Waters answered一"Indeed, sir, I have very particular business with you; and it is such as I can impart only to yourself. I must desire, therefore, the favour of a word with you alone: for I assure you what I have to tell you is of the utmost importance."
Partridge was then ordered to withdraw, but before he went, he begged the lady to satisfy Mr Allworthy that he was perfectly innocent. To which she answered, "You need be under no apprehension, sir; I shall satisfy Mr Allworthy very perfectly of that matter."
Then Partridge withdrew, and that past between Mr Allworthy and Mrs Waters which is written in the next chapter.

Chapter /
Continuation of the history.
Mrs Waters remaining a few moments silent, Mr Allworthy could not refrain from saying, "I am sorry, madam, to perceive, by what I have since heard, that you have made so very ill a use---" "Mr Allworthy,"
says she, interrupting him, "I know I have faults, but ingratitude to you is not one of them. I never can nor shall forget your goodness, which I own I have very little deserved; but be pleased to wave all upbraiding me at present, as I have so important an affair to communicate to you concerning this young man, to whom you have given my maiden name of Jones."
"Have I then," said Allworthy, "ignorantly punished an innocent man, in the person of him who hath just left us? Was he not the father of the child?" "Indeed he was not," said Mrs Waters. "You may be pleased to remember, sir, I formerly told you, you should one day know; and I acknowledge myself to have been guilty of a cruel neglect, in not having discovered it to you before. Indeed, I little knew how necessary it was." "Well, madam," said Allworthy, "be pleased to proceed." "You must remember, sir," said she, "a young fellow, whose name was Summer." "Very well," cries Allworthy, "he was the son of a clergyman of great learning and virtue, for whom I had the highest friendship." "So it appeared, sir," answered she; "for I believe you bred the young man up, and maintained him at the university; where, I think, he had finished his studies, when he came to reside at your house; a finer man, I must say, the sun never shone upon; for, besides the handsomest person I ever saw, he was so genteel, and had so much wit and good breeding." "Poor gentleman," said Allworthy, "he was indeed untimely snatched away; and little did I think he had any sins of this kind to answer for; for I plainly perceive you are going to tell me he was the father of your child."
"Indeed, sir," answered she, "he was not." "How!" said Allworthy, "to what then tends all this preface?" "To a story," said she, "which I am concerned falls to my lot to unfold to you. O, sir! prepare to hear something
865
which will surprize you, will grieve you." "Speak," said Allworthy, "I am conscious of no crime, and cannot be afraid to hear." "Sir," said she, "that Mr Summer, the son of your friend, educated at your expense, who, after living a year in the house as if he had been your own son, died there of the small-pox, was tenderly lamented by you, and buried as if he had been your own; that Summer, sir, was the father of this child." "How!" said Allworthy; "you contradict yourself." "That I do not," answered she; "he was indeed the father of this child, but not by me." "Take care, madam," said Allworthy, "do not, to shun the imputation of any crime, be guilty of falshood. Remember there is One from whom you can conceal nothing, and before whose tribunal falshood will only aggravate your guilt." "Indeed, sir," says she, "I am not his mother; nor would I now think myself so for the world." "I know your reason," said Allworthy, "and shall rejoice as much as you to find it otherwise; yet you must remember, you yourself confest it before me." "So far what I confest," said she, "was true, that these hands conveyed the infant to your bed; conveyed it thither at the command of its mother; at her commands I afterwards owned it, and thought myself, by her generosity, nobly rewarded, both for my secrecy and my shame." "Who could this woman be?" said Allworthy. "Indeed, I tremble to name her," answered Mrs Waters. "By all this preparation I am to guess that she was a relation of mine," cried he. "Indeed she was a near one." At which words Allworthy started, and she continued一"You had a sister, sir." "A sister!" repeated he, looking aghast.一"As there is truth in heaven," cries she, "your sister was the mother of that child you found between your sheets." "Can it be possible?" cries he, "Good heavens!" "Have patience, sir," said Mrs Waters, "and I will unfold to you the whole story. Just after your departure for London, Miss Bridget came one day to the house of my mother. She was pleased to say she had heard an extraordinary character of me, for my learning and superior understanding to all the young women there, so she was pleased to say. She then bid me come to her to the great house; where, when I attended, she employed me to read to her. She expressed great satisfaction in my reading, shewed great kindness to me, and made me many presents. At last she began to catechise me on the subject of secrecy, to which I gave her such satisfactory answers, that, at last, having locked the door of her room, she took me into her closet, and then locking that door likewise, she said she should convince me of the vast reliance she had on my integrity, by communicating a secret in which her honour, and consequently her life, was concerned. She then stopt, and after a silence of a few minutes, during which she often wiped her
866
eyes, she enquired of me if I thought my mother might safely be confided in. I answered, I would stake my life on her fidelity. She then imparted to me the great secret which laboured in her breast, and which, I believe, was delivered with more pains than she afterwards suffered in child-birth. It was then contrived that my mother and myself only should attend at the time, and that Mrs Wilkins should be sent out of the way, as she accordingly was, to the very furthest part of Dorsetshire, to enquire the character of a servant; for the lady had turned away her own maid near three months before; during all which time I officiated about her person upon trial, as she said, though, as she afterwards declared, I was not sufficiently handy for the place. This, and many other such things which she used to say of me, were all thrown out to prevent any suspicion which Wilkins might hereafter have, when I was to own the child; for she thought it could never be believed she would venture to hurt a young woman with whom she had intrusted such a secret. You may be assured, sir, I was well paid for all these affronts, which, together with being informed with the occasion of them, very well contented me. Indeed, the lady had a greater suspicion of Mrs Wilkins than of any other person; not that she had the least aversion to the gentlewoman, but she thought her incapable of keeping a secret, especially from you, sir; for I have often heard Miss Bridget say, that, if Mrs Wilkins had committed a murder, she believed she would acquaint you with it. At last the expected day came, and Mrs Wilkins, who had been kept a week in readiness, and put off from time to time, upon some pretence or other, that she might not return too soon, was dispatched. Then the child was born, in the presence only of myself and my mother, and was by my mother conveyed to her own house, where it was privately kept by her till the evening of your return, when I, by the command of Miss Bridget, conveyed it into the bed where you found it. And all suspicions were afterwards laid asleep by the artful conduct of your sister, in pretending ill-will to the boy, and that any regard she shewed him was out of meer complacence to you."
Mrs Waters then made many protestations of the truth of this story, and concluded by saying, "Thus, sir, you have at last discovered your nephew; for so I am sure you will hereafter think him, and I question not but he will be both an honour and a comfort to you under that appellation."
"I need not, madam," said Allworthy, "express my astonishment at what you have told me; and yet surely you would not, and could not, have put together so many circumstances to evidence an untruth. I
867
confess I recollect some passages relating to that Summer, which formerly gave me a conceit that my sister had some liking to him. I mentioned it to her; for I had such a regard to the young man, as well on his own account as on his father's, that I should willingly have consented to a match between them; but she exprest the highest disdain of my unkind suspicion, as she called it; so that I never spoke more on the subject. Good heavens! Well! the Lord disposeth all things.一Yet sure it was a most unjustifiable conduct in my sister to carry this secret with her out of the world." "I promise you, sir," said Mrs Waters, "she always profest a contrary intention, and frequently told me she intended one day to communicate it to you. She said, indeed, she was highly rejoiced that her plot had succeeded so well, and that you had of your own accord taken such a fancy to the child, that it was yet unnecessary to make any express declaration. Oh! sir, had that lady lived to have seen this poor young man turned like a vagabond from your house: nay, sir, could she have lived to hear that you had yourself employed a lawyer to prosecute him for a murder of which he was not guilty---Forgive me, Mr Allworthy, I must
say it was unkind.—Indeed, you have been abused, he never deserved it of you." "Indeed, madam," said Allworthy, "I have been abused by the person, whoever he was, that told you so." "Nay, sir," said she, "I would not be mistaken, I did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong. The gentleman who came to me proposed no such matter; he only said, taking me for Mr Fitzpatrick's wife, that, if Mr Jones had murdered my husband, I should be assisted with any money I wanted to carry on the prosecution, by a very worthy gentleman, who, he said, was well apprized what a villain I had to deal with. It was by this man I found out who Mr Jones was; and this man, whose name is Dowling, Mr Jones tells me is your steward. I discovered his name by a very odd accident; for he himself refused to tell it me; but Partridge, who met him at my lodgings the second time he came, knew him formerly at Salisbury."
"And did this Mr Dowling," says Allworthy, with great astonishment in his countenance, "tell you that I would assist in the prosecu-tion?"—"No, sir," answered she, "I will not charge him wrongfully. He said I should be assisted, but he mentioned no name. Yet you must pardon me, sir, if from circumstances I thought it could be no oth-er."一"Indeed, madam," says Allworthy, "from circumstances I am too well convinced it was another. Good Heaven! by what wonderful means is the blackest and deepest villany sometimes discovered!—Shall I beg you, madam, to stay till the person you have mentioned comes, for I expect him every minute? nay, he may be, perhaps, already in the house."
868
Allworthy then stept to the door, in order to call a servant, when in came, not Mr Dowling, but the gentleman who will be seen in the next chapter.

Chapter V?
Further continuation.
The gentleman who now arrived was no other than Mr Western. He no sooner saw Allworthy, than, without considering in the least the presence of Mrs Waters, he began to vociferate in the following manner: "Fine doings at my house! A rare kettle of fish I have discovered at last! who the devil would be plagued with a daughter?" "What's the matter, neighbour?" said Allworthy. "Matter enough," answered Western: "when I thought she was just a coming to; nay, when she had in a manner promised me to do as I would ha her, and when I was a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have sent for the lawyer, and finished all; what do you think I have found out? that the little b一 hath bin playing tricks with me all the while, and carrying on a correspondence with that bastard of yours. Sister Western, whom I have quarrelled with upon her account, sent me word o't, and I ordered her pockets to be searched when she was asleep, and here I have got un signed with the son of a whore's own name. I have not had patience to read half o't, for 'tis longer than one of parson Supple's sermons; but I find plainly it is all about love; and indeed what should it be else? I have packed her up in chamber again, and to-morrow morning down she goes into the country, unless she consents to be married directly, and there she shall live in a garret upon bread and water all her days; and the sooner such a b一 breaks her heart the better, though, d一n her, that I believe is too tough. She will live long enough to plague me." "Mr Western," answered Allworthy, "you know I have always protested against force, and you yourself consented that none should be used." "Ay," cries he, "that was only upon condition that she would consent without. What the devil and doctor Faustus! shan't I do what I will with my own daughter, especially when I desire nothing but her own good?" "Well, neighbour," answered Allworthy, "if you will give me leave, I will undertake once to argue with the young lady." "Will you?" said Western; "why that is kind now, and neighbourly, and mayhap you will do more than I have been able to do
870
with her; for I promise you she hath a very good opinion of you." "Well, sir," said Allworthy, "if you will go home, and release the young lady from her captivity, I will wait upon her within this half-hour." "But suppose," said Western, "she should run away with un in the meantime? For lawyer Dowling tells me there is no hopes of hanging the fellow at last; for that the man is alive, and like to do well, and that he thinks Jones will be out of prison again presently." "How!" said Allworthy; "what, did you employ him then to enquire or to do anything in that matter?" "Not I," answered Western, "he mentioned it to me just now of his own accord." "Just now!" cries Allworthy, "why, where did you see him then? I want much to see Mr Dowling." "Why, you may see un an you will presently at my lodgings; for there is to be a meeting of lawyers there this morning about a mortgage. 'Icod! I shall lose two or dree thousand pounds, I believe, by that honest gentleman, Mr Nightingale." "Well, sir," said Allworthy, "I will be with you within the half-hour." "And do for once," cries the squire, "take a fool's advice; never think of dealing with her by gentle methods, take my word for it those will never do. I have tried 'um long enough. She must be frightened into it, there is no other way. Tell her I'm her father; and of the horrid sin of disobedience, and of the dreadful punishment of it in t'other world, and then tell her about being locked up all her life in a garret in this, and being kept only on bread and water." "I will do all I can," said Allworthy; "for I promise you there is nothing I wish for more than an alliance with this amiable creature." "Nay, the girl is well enough for matter o' that," cries the squire; "a man may go farther and meet with worse meat; that I may declare o'her, thof she be my own daughter. And if she will but be obedient to me, there is narrow a father within a hundred miles o' the place, that loves a daughter better than I do; but I see you are busy with the lady here, so I will go huome and expect you; and so your humble servant."
As soon as Mr Western was gone Mrs Waters said, "I see, sir, the squire hath not the least remembrance of my face. I believe, Mr Allworthy, you would not have known me neither. I am very considerably altered since that day when you so kindly gave me that advice, which I had been happy had I followed." "Indeed, madam," cries Allworthy, "it gave me great concern when I first heard the contrary." "Indeed, sir," says she, "I was ruined by a very deep scheme of villany, which if you knew, though I pretend not to think it would justify me in your opinion, it would at least mitigate my offence, and induce you to pity me: you are not now at leisure to hear my whole story; but this I assure you, I was betrayed by the most solemn promises of marriage; nay, in the eye of
871
heaven I was married to him; for, after much reading on the subject, I am convinced that particular ceremonies are only requisite to give a legal sanction to marriage, and have only a worldly use in giving a woman the privileges of a wife; but that she who lives constant to one man, after a solemn private affiance, whatever the world may call her, hath little to charge on her own conscience." "I am sorry, madam," said Allworthy, "you made so ill a use of your learning. Indeed, it would have been well that you had been possessed of much more, or had remained in a state of ignorance. And yet, madam, I am afraid you have more than this sin to answer for." "During his life," answered she, "which was above a dozen years, I most solemnly assure you I had not. And consider, sir, on my behalf, what is in the power of a woman stript of her reputation and left destitute; whether the good-natured world will suffer such a stray sheep to return to the road of virtue, even if she was never so desirous. I protest, then, I would have chose it had it been in my power; but necessity drove me into the arms of Captain Waters, with whom, though still unmarried, I lived as a wife for many years, and went by his name. I parted with this gentleman at Worcester, on his march against the rebels, and it was then I accidentally met with Mr Jones, who rescued me from the hands of a villain. Indeed, he is the worthiest of men. No young gentleman of his age is, I believe, freer from vice, and few have the twentieth part of his virtues; nay, whatever vices he hath had, I am firmly persuaded he hath now taken a resolution to abandon them." "I hope he hath," cries Allworthy, "and I hope he will preserve that resolution. I must say, I have still the same hopes with regard to yourself. The world, I do agree, are apt to be too unmerciful on these occasions; yet time and perseverance will get the better of this their disinclination, as I may call it, to pity; for though they are not, like heaven, ready to receive a penitent sinner; yet a continued repentance will at length obtain mercy even with the world. This you may be assured of, Mrs Waters, that whenever I find you are sincere in such good intentions, you shall want no assistance in my power to make them effectual."
Mrs Waters fell now upon her knees before him, and, in a flood of tears, made him many most passionate acknowledgments of his goodness, which, as she truly said, savoured more of the divine than human nature.
Allworthy raised her up, and spoke in the most tender manner, making use of every expression which his invention could suggest to comfort her, when he was interrupted by the arrival of Mr Dowling, who, upon his first entrance, seeing Mrs Waters, started, and appeared in some
872
confusion; from which he soon recovered himself as well as he could, and then said he was in the utmost haste to attend counsel at Mr Western's lodgings; but, however, thought it his duty to call and acquaint him with the opinion of counsel upon the case which he had before told him, which was that the conversion of the moneys in that case could not be questioned in a criminal cause, but that an action of trover might be brought, and if it appeared to the jury to be the moneys of plaintiff, that plaintiff would recover a verdict for the value.
Allworthy, without making any answer to this, bolted the door, and then, advancing with a stern look to Dowling, he said, "Whatever be your haste, sir, I must first receive an answer to some questions. Do you know this lady?"—"That lady, sir!" answered Dowling, with great hesitation. Allworthy then, with the most solemn voice, said, "Look you, Mr Dowling, as you value my favour, or your continuance a moment longer in my service, do not hesitate nor prevaricate; but answer faithfully and truly to every question I ask.-Do you know this lady?"一"Yes, sir,"
said Dowling, "I have seen the lady." "Where, sir?" "At her own lodgings."一"Upon what business did you go thither, sir; and who sent you?" "I went, sir, to enquire, sir, about Mr Jones." "And who sent you to enquire about him?" "Who, sir? why, sir, Mr Blifil sent me." "And what did you say to the lady concerning that matter?" "Nay, sir, it is impossible to recollect every word." "Will you please, madam, to assist the gentleman's memory?" "He told me, sir," said Mrs Waters, "that if Mr Jones had murdered my husband, I should be assisted by any money I wanted to carry on the prosecution, by a very worthy gentleman, who was well apprized what a villain I had to deal with. These, I can safely swear, were the very words he spoke."一"Were these the words, sir?" said Allworthy. "I cannot charge my memory exactly," cries Dowling, "but I believe I did speak to that purpose."一"And did Mr Blifil order you to say so?" "I am sure, sir, I should not have gone on my own accord, nor have willingly exceeded my authority in matters of this kind. If I said so, I must have so understood Mr Blifil's instructions." "Look you, Mr Dowling," said Allworthy; "I promise you before this lady, that whatever you have done in this affair by Mr Blifil's order I will forgive, provided you now tell me strictly the truth; for I believe what you say, that you would not have acted of your own accord and without authority in this matter.---Mr Blifil then likewise sent you to examine the two fellows at
Aldersgate?"一"He did, sir." "Well, and what instructions did he then give you? Recollect as well as you can, and tell me, as near as possible, the very words he used."一"Why, sir, Mr Blifil sent me to find out the
873
persons who were eye-witnesses of this fight. He said, he feared they might be tampered with by Mr Jones, or some of his friends. He said, blood required blood; and that not only all who concealed a murderer, but those who omitted anything in their power to bring him to justice, were sharers in his guilt. He said, he found you was very desirous of having the villain brought to justice, though it was not proper you should appear in it." "He did so?" says Allworthy.一"Yes, sir," cries Dowling; "I should not, I am sure, have proceeded such lengths for the sake of any other person living but your worship."一"What lengths, sir?" said Allworthy.一"Nay, sir," cries Dowling, "I would not have your worship think I would, on any account, be guilty of subornation of perjury; but there are two ways of delivering evidence. I told them, therefore, that if any offers should be made them on the other side, they should refuse them, and that they might be assured they should lose nothing by being honest men, and telling the truth. I said, we were told that Mr Jones had assaulted the gentleman first, and that, if that was the truth, they should declare it; and I did give them some hints that they should be no losers."一"I think you went lengths indeed," cries Allworthy.一"Nay, sir," answered Dowling, "I am sure I did not desire them to tell an untruth;---nor should I have said what I did, unless it had been to oblige
you."一"You would not have thought, I believe," says Allworthy, "to have obliged me, had you known that this Mr Jones was my own neph-ew."—"I am sure, sir," answered he, "it did not become me to take any notice of what I thought you desired to conceal."一"How!" cries Allworthy, "and did you know it then?"一"Nay, sir," answered Dowling, "if your worship bids me speak the truth, I am sure I shall do it.一Indeed, sir, I did know it; for they were almost the last words which Madam Bli-fil ever spoke, which she mentioned to me as I stood alone by her bedside, when she delivered me the letter I brought your worship from her."一"What letter?" cries Allworthy.一"The letter, sir," answered Dowling, "which I brought from Salisbury, and which I delivered into the hands of Mr Blifil."一"O heavens!" cries Allworthy: "Well, and what were the words? What did my sister say to you?"一"She took me by the hand," answered he, "and, as she delivered me the letter, said, 'I scarce know what I have written. Tell my brother, Mr Jones is his nephew一He is my son.一Bless him,' says she, and then fell backward, as if dying away. I presently called in the people, and she never spoke more to me, and died within a few minutes afterwards."—Allworthy stood a minute silent, lifting up his eyes; and then, turning to Dowling, said, "How came you, sir, not to deliver me this message?" "Your worship," answered he, "must
874
remember that you was at that time ill in bed; and, being in a violent hurry, as indeed I always am, I delivered the letter and message to Mr Blifil, who told me he would carry them both to you, which he hath since told me he did, and that your worship, partly out of friendship to Mr Jones, and partly out of regard to your sister, would never have it mentioned, and did intend to conceal it from the world; and therefore, sir, if you had not mentioned it to me first, I am certain I should never have thought it belonged to me to say anything of the matter, either to your worship or any other person."
We have remarked somewhere already, that it is possible for a man to convey a lie in the words of truth; this was the case at present; for Blifil had, in fact, told Dowling what he now related, but had not imposed upon him, nor indeed had imagined he was able so to do. In reality, the promises which Blifil had made to Dowling were the motives which had induced him to secrecy; and, as he now very plainly saw Blifil would not be able to keep them, he thought proper now to make this confession, which the promises of forgiveness, joined to the threats, the voice, the looks of Allworthy, and the discoveries he had made before, extorted from him, who was besides taken unawares, and had no time to consider of evasions.
Allworthy appeared well satisfied with this relation, and, having enjoined on Dowling strict silence as to what had past, conducted that gentleman himself to the door, lest he should see Blifil, who was returned to his chamber, where he exulted in the thoughts of his last deceit on his uncle, and little suspected what had since passed below-stairs.
As Allworthy was returning to his room he met Mrs Miller in the entry, who, with a face all pale and full of terror, said to him, "O! sir, I find this wicked woman hath been with you, and you know all; yet do not on this account abandon the poor young man. Consider, sir, he was ignorant it was his own mother; and the discovery itself will most probably break his heart, without your unkindness."
"Madam," says Allworthy, "I am under such an astonishment at what I have heard, that I am really unable to satisfy you; but come with me into my room. Indeed, Mrs Miller, I have made surprizing discoveries, and you shall soon know them."
The poor woman followed him trembling; and now Allworthy, going up to Mrs Waters, took her by the hand, and then, turning to Mrs Miller, said, "What reward shall I bestow upon this gentlewoman, for the services she hath done me?一O! Mrs Miller, you have a thousand times
875
heard me call the young man to whom you are so faithful a friend, my son. Little did I then think he was indeed related to me at all.一Your friend, madam, is my nephew; he is the brother of that wicked viper which I have so long nourished in my bosom.一She will herself tell you the whole story, and how the youth came to pass for her son. Indeed, Mrs Miller, I am convinced that he hath been wronged, and that I have been abused; abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a villain. He is, in truth, the worst of villains."
The joy which Mrs Miller now felt bereft her of the power of speech, and might perhaps have deprived her of her senses, if not of life, had not a friendly shower of tears come seasonably to her relief. At length, recovering so far from her transport as to be able to speak, she cried, "And is my dear Mr Jones then your nephew, sir, and not the son of this lady? And are your eyes opened to him at last? And shall I live to see him as happy as he deserves?" "He certainly is my nephew," says Allworthy, "and I hope all the rest."一"And is this the dear good woman, the person," cries she, "to whom all this discovery is owing?"一"She is indeed," says Allworthy.一"Why, then," cried Mrs Miller, upon her knees, "may Heaven shower down its choicest blessings upon her head, and for this one good action forgive her all her sins, be they never so many!"
Mrs Waters then informed them that she believed Jones would very shortly be released; for that the surgeon was gone, in company with a nobleman, to the justice who committed him, in order to certify that Mr Fitzpatrick was out of all manner of danger, and to procure his prisoner his liberty.
Allworthy said he should be glad to find his nephew there at his return home; but that he was then obliged to go on some business of consequence. He then called to a servant to fetch him a chair, and presently left the two ladies together.
Mr Blifil, hearing the chair ordered, came downstairs to attend upon his uncle; for he never was deficient in such acts of duty. He asked his uncle if he was going out, which is a civil way of asking a man whither he is going: to which the other making no answer, he again desired to know when he would be pleased to return?一Allworthy made no answer to this neither, till he was just going into his chair, and then, turning about, he said一"Harkee, sir, do you find out, before my return, the letter which your mother sent me on her death-bed." Allworthy then departed, and left Blifil in a situation to be envied only by a man who is just going to be hanged.

Chapter J
A further continuation.
Allworthy took an opportunity, whilst he was in the chair, of reading the letter from Jones to Sophia, which Western delivered him; and there were some expressions in it concerning himself which drew tears from his eyes. At length he arrived at Mr Western's, and was introduced to Sophia.
When the first ceremonies were past, and the gentleman and lady had taken their chairs, a silence of some minutes ensued; during which the latter, who had been prepared for the visit by her father, sat playing with her fan, and had every mark of confusion both in her countenance and behaviour. At length Allworthy, who was himself a little disconcerted, began thus: "I am afraid, Miss Western, my family hath been the occasion of giving you some uneasiness; to which, I fear, I have innocently become more instrumental than I intended. Be assured, madam, had I at first known how disagreeable the proposals had been, I should not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted. I hope, therefore, you will not think the design of this visit is to trouble you with any further solicitations of that kind, but entirely to relieve you from them."
"Sir," said Sophia, with a little modest hesitation, "this behaviour is most kind and generous, and such as I could expect only from Mr Allworthy; but as you have been so kind to mention this matter, you will pardon me for saying it hath, indeed, given me great uneasiness, and hath been the occasion of my suffering much cruel treatment from a father who was, till that unhappy affair, the tenderest and fondest of all parents. I am convinced, sir, you are too good and generous to resent my refusal of your nephew. Our inclinations are not in our own power; and whatever may be his merit, I cannot force them in his favour." "I assure you, most amiable young lady," said Allworthy, "I am capable of no such resentment, had the person been my own son, and had I entertained the highest esteem for him. For you say truly, madam, we cannot force our inclinations, much less can they be directed by another." "Oh! sir,"
877
answered Sophia, "every word you speak proves you deserve that good, that great, that benevolent character the whole world allows you. I assure you, sir, nothing less than the certain prospect of future misery could have made me resist the commands of my father." "I sincerely believe you, madam," replied Allworthy, "and I heartily congratulate you on your prudent foresight, since by so justifiable a resistance you have avoided misery indeed!" "You speak now, Mr Allworthy," cries she, "with a delicacy which few men are capable of feeling! but surely, in my opinion, to lead our lives with one to whom we are indifferent must be a state of wretchedness.---Perhaps that wretchedness would be even in-
creased by a sense of the merits of an object to whom we cannot give our affections. If I had married Mr Blifil一" "Pardon my interrupting you, madam," answered Allworthy, "but I cannot bear the supposi-tion.一Believe me, Miss Western, I rejoice from my heart, I rejoice in your escape.一I have discovered the wretch for whom you have suffered all this cruel violence from your father to be a villain." "How, sir!" cries Sophia一"you must believe this surprizes me."一"It hath surprized me, madam," answered Allworthy, "and so it will the world.----But I have
acquainted you with the real truth." "Nothing but truth," says Sophia, "can, I am convinced, come from the lips of Mr Allworthy.----Yet, sir,
such sudden, such unexpected news.------Discovered, you say-----may
villany be ever so!"—"You will soon enough hear the story," cries Allworthy;一"at present let us not mention so detested a name.一I have another matter of a very serious nature to propose.一O! Miss Western, I know your vast worth, nor can I so easily part with the ambition of being allied to it.一I have a near relation, madam, a young man whose character is, I am convinced, the very opposite to that of this wretch, and whose fortune I will make equal to what his was to have been. Could I, madam, hope you would admit a visit from him?" Sophia, after a minute's silence, answered, "I will deal with the utmost sincerity with Mr Allworthy. His character, and the obligation I have just received from him, demand it. I have determined at present to listen to no such proposals from any person. My only desire is to be restored to the affection of my father, and to be again the mistress of his family. This, sir, I hope to owe to your good offices. Let me beseech you, let me conjure you, by all the goodness which I, and all who know you, have experienced, do not, the very moment when you have released me from one persecution, do not engage me in another as miserable and as fruitless." "Indeed, Miss Western," replied Allworthy, "I am capable of no such conduct; and if this be your resolution, he must submit to the disappointment, whatever
878
torments he may suffer under it." "I must smile now, Mr Allworthy," answered Sophia, "when you mention the torments of a man whom I do not know, and who can consequently have so little acquaintance with me." "Pardon me, dear young lady," cries Allworthy, "I begin now to be afraid he hath had too much acquaintance for the repose of his future days; since, if ever man was capable of a sincere, violent, and noble passion, such, I am convinced, is my unhappy nephew's for Miss Western." "A nephew of your's, Mr Allworthy!" answered Sophia. "It is surely strange. I never heard of him before." "Indeed, madam," cries Allworthy, "it is only the circumstance of his being my nephew to which you are a stranger, and which, till this day, was a secret to me.一Mr Jones, who has long loved you, he! he is my nephew!" "Mr Jones your nephew, sir!" cries Sophia, "can it be possible?"一"He is, indeed, madam," answered Allworthy; "he is my own sister's son一as such I shall always own him; nor am I ashamed of owning him. I am much more ashamed of my past behaviour to him; but I was as ignorant of his merit as of his birth. Indeed, Miss Western, I have used him cruelly---Indeed I have."一Here the
good man wiped his eyes, and after a short pause proceeded一"I never shall be able to reward him for his sufferings without your assistance.---Believe me, most amiable young lady, I must have a great es-
teem of that offering which I make to your worth. I know he hath been guilty of faults; but there is great goodness of heart at the bottom. Believe me, madam, there is." Here he stopped, seeming to expect an answer, which he presently received from Sophia, after she had a little recovered herself from the hurry of spirits into which so strange and sudden information had thrown her: "I sincerely wish you joy, sir, of a discovery in which you seem to have such satisfaction. I doubt not but you will have all the comfort you can promise yourself from it. The young gentleman hath certainly a thousand good qualities, which makes it impossible he should not behave well to such an uncle."一"I hope, madam," said Allworthy, "he hath those good qualities which must make him a good hus-band.一He must, I am sure, be of all men the most abandoned, if a lady of your merit should condescend一" "You must pardon me, Mr Allworthy," answered Sophia; "I cannot listen to a proposal of this kind. Mr Jones, I am convinced, hath much merit; but I shall never receive Mr Jones as one who is to be my husband一Upon my honour I never will."—"Pardon me, madam," cries Allworthy, "if I am a little surprized, after what I have heard from Mr Western一I hope the unhappy young man hath done nothing to forfeit your good opinion, if he had ever the honour to enjoy it.一Perhaps, he may have been misrepresented to you,
879
as he was to me. The same villany may have injured him everywhere.一He is no murderer, I assure you; as he hath been called."一"Mr Allworthy," answered Sophia, "I have told you my resolution. I wonder not at what my father hath told you; but, whatever his apprehensions or fears have been, if I know my heart, I have given no occasion for them; since it hath always been a fixed principle with me, never to have married without his consent. This is, I think, the duty of a child to a parent; and this, I hope, nothing could ever have prevailed with me to swerve from. I do not indeed conceive that the authority of any parent can oblige us to marry in direct opposition to our inclinations. To avoid a force of this kind, which I had reason to suspect, I left my father's house, and sought protection elsewhere. This is the truth of my story; and if the world, or my father, carry my intentions any farther, my own conscience will acquit me." "I hear you, Miss Western," cries Allworthy, "with admiration. I admire the justness of your sentiments; but surely there is more in this. I am cautious of offending you, young lady; but am I to look on all which I have hitherto heard or seen as a dream only? And have you suffered so much cruelty from your father on the account of a man to whom you have been always absolutely indifferent?" "I beg, Mr Allworthy," answered Sophia, "you will not insist on my reasons;一yes, I have suffered indeed; I will not, Mr Allworthy, conceal-1 will be very
sincere with you一I own I had a great opinion of Mr Jones一I believe一I know I have suffered for my opinion一I have been treated cruelly by my aunt, as well as by my father; but that is now past一I beg I may not be farther pressed; for, whatever hath been, my resolution is now fixed. Your nephew, sir, hath many virtues一he hath great virtues, Mr Allworthy. I question not but he will do you honour in the world, and make you happy."一"I wish I could make him so, madam," replied Allworthy; "but that I am convinced is only in your power. It is that conviction which hath made me so earnest a solicitor in his favour." "You are deceived indeed, sir; you are deceived," said Sophia. "I hope not by him. It is sufficient to have deceived me. Mr Allworthy, I must insist on being pressed no farther on this subject. I should be sorry一nay, I will not injure him in your favour. I wish Mr Jones very well. I sincerely wish him well; and I repeat it again to you, whatever demerit he may have to me, I am certain he hath many good qualities. I do not disown my former thoughts; but nothing can ever recal them. At present there is not a man upon earth whom I would more resolutely reject than Mr Jones; nor would the addresses of Mr Blifil himself be less agreeable to me."
880
Western had been long impatient for the event of this conference, and was just now arrived at the door to listen; when, having heard the last sentiments of his daughter's heart, he lost all temper, and, bursting open the door in a rage, cried out—"It is a lie! It is a d—n'd lie! It is all owing to that d一n'd rascal Jones; and if she could get at un, she'd ha un any hour of the day." Here Allworthy interposed, and addressing himself to the squire with some anger in his look, he said, "Mr Western, you have not kept your word with me. You promised to abstain from all violence."—"Why, so I did," cries Western, "as long as it was possible; but to hear a wench telling such confounded lies-Zounds! doth she think, if
she can make vools of other volk, she can make one of me?一No, no, I know her better than thee dost." "I am sorry to tell you, sir," answered Allworthy, "it doth not appear, by your behaviour to this young lady, that you know her at all. I ask pardon for what I say: but I think our intimacy, your own desires, and the occasion justify me. She is your daughter, Mr Western, and I think she doth honour to your name. If I was capable of envy, I should sooner envy you on this account than any other man whatever."—"Odrabbit it!" cries the squire, "I wish she was thine, with all my heart—wouldst soon be glad to be rid of the trouble o' her." "Indeed, my good friend," answered Allworthy, "you yourself are the cause of all the trouble you complain of. Place that confidence in the young lady which she so well deserves, and I am certain you will be the happiest father on earth."一"I confidence in her?" cries the squire. "'Sblood! what confidence can I place in her, when she won't do as I would ha' her? Let her gi' but her consent to marry as I would ha' her, and I'll place as much confidence in her as wouldst ha' me."一"You have no right, neighbour," answered Allworthy, "to insist on any such consent. A negative voice your daughter allows you, and God and nature have thought proper to allow you no more."一"A negative voice!" cries the squire, "Ay! ay! I'll show you what a negative voice I ha.一Go along, go into your chamber, go, you stubborn--." "Indeed, Mr Western," said
Allworthy, "indeed you use her cruelly一I cannot bear to see this一you shall, you must behave to her in a kinder manner. She deserves the best of treatment." "Yes, yes," said the squire, "I know what she deserves: now she's gone, I'll shew you what she deserves. See here, sir, here is a letter from my cousin, my Lady Bellaston, in which she is so kind to gi' me to understand that the fellow is got out of prison again; and here she advises me to take all the care I can o' the wench. Odzookers! neighbour Allworthy, you don't know what it is to govern a daughter."
881
The squire ended his speech with some compliments to his own sagacity; and then Allworthy, after a formal preface, acquainted him with the whole discovery which he had made concerning Jones, with his anger to Blifil, and with every particular which hath been disclosed to the reader in the preceding chapters.
Men over-violent in their dispositions are, for the most part, as changeable in them. No sooner then was Western informed of Mr Allworthy's intention to make Jones his heir, than he joined heartily with the uncle in every commendation of the nephew, and became as eager for her marriage with Jones as he had before been to couple her to Blifil.
Here Mr Allworthy was again forced to interpose, and to relate what had passed between him and Sophia, at which he testified great surprize.
The squire was silent a moment, and looked wild with astonishment at this account.一At last he cried out, "Why, what can be the meaning of this, neighbour Allworthy? Vond o'un she was, that I'll be sworn to.---Odzookers! I have hit o't. As sure as a gun I have hit o' the very
right o't. It's all along o' zister. The girl hath got a hankering after this son of a whore of a lord. I vound 'em together at my cousin my Lady Bellaston's. He hath turned the head o' her, that's certain一but d一n me if he shall ha her一I'll ha no lords nor courtiers in my vamily."
Allworthy now made a long speech, in which he repeated his resolution to avoid all violent measures, and very earnestly recommended gentle methods to Mr Western, as those by which he might be assured of succeeding best with his daughter. He then took his leave, and returned back to Mrs Miller, but was forced to comply with the earnest entreaties of the squire, in promising to bring Mr Jones to visit him that afternoon, that he might, as he said, "make all matters up with the young gentleman." At Mr Allworthy's departure, Western promised to follow his advice in his behaviour to Sophia, saying, "I don't know how 'tis, but d—n me, Allworthy, if you don't make me always do just as you please; and yet I have as good an estate as you, and am in the commission of the peace as well as yourself."

Chapter A Vx
Wherein the history begins to draw towards a conclusion.
When Allworthy returned to his lodgings, he heard Mr Jones was just arrived before him. He hurried therefore instantly into an empty chamber, whither he ordered Mr Jones to be brought to him alone.
It is impossible to conceive a more tender or moving scene than the meeting between the uncle and nephew (for Mrs Waters, as the reader may well suppose, had at her last visit discovered to him the secret of his birth). The first agonies of joy which were felt on both sides are indeed beyond my power to describe: I shall not therefore attempt it. After Allworthy had raised Jones from his feet, where he had prostrated himself, and received him into his arms, "O my child!" he cried, "how have I been to blame! how have I injured you! What amends can I ever make you for those unkind, those unjust suspicions which I have entertained, and for all the sufferings they have occasioned to you?" "Am I not now made amends?" cries Jones. "Would not my sufferings, if they had been ten times greater, have been now richly repaid? O my dear uncle, this goodness, this tenderness overpowers, unmans, destroys me. I cannot bear the transports which flow so fast upon me. To be again restored to your presence, to your favour; to be once more thus kindly received by my great, my noble, my generous benefactor."一"Indeed, child," cries Allworthy, "I have used you cruelly."---He then explained to him all the
treachery of Blifil, and again repeated expressions of the utmost concern, for having been induced by that treachery to use him so ill. "O, talk not so!" answered Jones; "indeed, sir, you have used me nobly. The wisest man might be deceived as you were; and, under such a deception, the best must have acted just as you did. Your goodness displayed itself in the midst of your anger, just as it then seemed. I owe everything to that goodness, of which I have been most unworthy. Do not put me on selfaccusation, by carrying your generous sentiments too far. Alas! sir, I have not been punished more than I have deserved; and it shall be the whole business of my future life to deserve that happiness you now
883
bestow on me; for, believe me, my dear uncle, my punishment hath not been thrown away upon me: though I have been a great, I am not a hardened sinner; I thank Heaven, I have had time to reflect on my past life, where, though I cannot charge myself with any gross villany, yet I can discern follies and vices more than enough to repent and to be ashamed of; follies which have been attended with dreadful consequences to myself, and have brought me to the brink of destruction." "I am rejoiced, my dear child," answered Allworthy, "to hear you talk thus sensibly; for as I am convinced hypocrisy (good Heaven! how have I been imposed on by it in others!) was never among your faults, so I can readily believe all you say. You now see, Tom, to what dangers imprudence alone may subject virtue (for virtue, I am now convinced, you love in a great degree). Prudence is indeed the duty which we owe to ourselves; and if we will be so much our own enemies as to neglect it, we are not to wonder if the world is deficient in discharging their duty to us; for when a man lays the foundation of his own ruin, others will, I am afraid, be too apt to build upon it. You say, however, you have seen your errors, and will reform them. I firmly believe you, my dear child; and therefore, from this moment, you shall never be reminded of them by me. Remember them only yourself so far as for the future to teach you the better to avoid them; but still remember, for your comfort, that there is this great difference between those faults which candor may construe into imprudence, and those which can be deduced from villany only. The former, perhaps, are even more apt to subject a man to ruin; but if he reform, his character will, at length, be totally retrieved; the world, though not immediately, will in time be reconciled to him; and he may reflect, not without some mixture of pleasure, on the dangers he hath escaped; but villany, my boy, when once discovered is irretrievable; the stains which this leaves behind, no time will wash away. The censures of mankind will pursue the wretch, their scorn will abash him in publick; and if shame drives him into retirement, he will go to it with all those terrors with which a weary child, who is afraid of hobgoblins, retreats from company to go to bed alone. Here his murdered conscience will haunt him.一Repose, like a false friend, will fly from him. Wherever he turns his eyes, horror presents itself; if he looks backward, unavailable repentance treads on his heels; if forward, incurable despair stares him in the face, till, like a condemned prisoner confined in a dungeon, he detests his present condition, and yet dreads the consequence of that hour which is to relieve him from it. Comfort yourself, I say, my child, that this is not your case; and rejoice with thankfulness to him who hath
884
suffered you to see your errors, before they have brought on you that destruction to which a persistance in even those errors must have led you. You have deserted them; and the prospect now before you is such, that happiness seems in your own power." At these words Jones fetched a deep sigh; upon which, when Allworthy remonstrated, he said, "Sir, I will conceal nothing from you: I fear there is one consequence of my vices I shall never be able to retrieve. O, my dear uncle! I have lost a treasure." "You need say no more," answered Allworthy; "I will be explicit with you; I know what you lament; I have seen the young lady, and have discoursed with her concerning you. This I must insist on, as an earnest of your sincerity in all you have said, and of the stedfastness of your resolution, that you obey me in one instance. To abide intirely by the determination of the young lady, whether it shall be in your favour or no. She hath already suffered enough from solicitations which I hate to think of; she shall owe no further constraint to my family: I know her father will be as ready to torment her now on your account as he hath formerly been on another's; but I am determined she shall suffer no more confinement, no more violence, no more uneasy hours." "O, my dear uncle!" answered Jones, "lay, I beseech you, some command on me, in which I shall have some merit in obedience. Believe me, sir, the only instance in which I could disobey you would be to give an uneasy moment to my Sophia. No, sir, if I am so miserable to have incurred her displeasure beyond all hope of forgiveness, that alone, with the dreadful reflection of causing her misery, will be sufficient to overpower me. To call Sophia mine is the greatest, and now the only additional blessing which heaven can bestow; but it is a blessing which I must owe to her alone." "I will not flatter you, child," cries Allworthy; "I fear your case is desperate: I never saw stronger marks of an unalterable resolution in any person than appeared in her vehement declarations against receiving your addresses; for which, perhaps, you can account better than myself." "Oh, sir! I can account too well," answered Jones; "I have sinned against her beyond all hope of pardon; and guilty as I am, my guilt unfortunately appears to her in ten times blacker than the real colours. O, my dear uncle! I find my follies are irretrievable; and all your goodness cannot save me from perdition."
A servant now acquainted them that Mr Western was below-stairs; for his eagerness to see Jones could not wait till the afternoon. Upon which Jones, whose eyes were full of tears, begged his uncle to entertain Western a few minutes, till he a little recovered himself; to which the
885
good man consented, and, having ordered Mr Western to be shewn into a parlour, went down to him.
Mrs Miller no sooner heard that Jones was alone (for she had not yet seen him since his release from prison) than she came eagerly into the room, and, advancing towards Jones, wished him heartily joy of his newfound uncle and his happy reconciliation; adding, "I wish I could give you joy on another account, my dear child; but anything so inexorable I never saw."
Jones, with some appearance of surprize, asked her what she meant. "Why then," says she, "I have been with your young lady, and have explained all matters to her, as they were told to me by my son Nightingale. She can have no longer any doubt about the letter; of that I am certain; for I told her my son Nightingale was ready to take his oath, if she pleased, that it was all his own invention, and the letter of his inditing. I told her the very reason of sending the letter ought to recommend you to her the more, as it was all upon her account, and a plain proof that you was resolved to quit all your profligacy for the future; that you had never been guilty of a single instance of infidelity to her since your seeing her in town: I am afraid I went too far there; but Heaven forgive me! I hope your future behaviour will be my justification. I am sure I have said all I can; but all to no purpose. She remains inflexible. She says, she had forgiven many faults on account of youth; but expressed such detestation of the character of a libertine, that she absolutely silenced me. I often attempted to excuse you; but the justness of her accusation flew in my face. Upon my honour, she is a lovely woman, and one of the sweetest and most sensible creatures I ever saw. I could have almost kissed her for one expression she made use of. It was a sentiment worthy of Seneca, or of a bishop. 'I once fancied madam.' and she, 'I had discovered great goodness of heart in Mr Jones; and for that I own I had a sincere esteem; but an entire profligacy of manners will corrupt the best heart in the world; and all which a good-natured libertine can expect is, that we should mix some grains of pity with our contempt and abhorrence.' She is an angelic creature, that is the truth on't." "O, Mrs Miller!" answered Jones, "can I bear to think that I have lost such an angel?" "Lost! no," cries Mrs Miller; "I hope you have not lost her yet. Resolve to leave such vicious courses, and you may yet have hopes, nay, if she would remain inexorable, there is another young lady, a sweet pretty young lady, and a swinging fortune, who is absolutely dying for love of you. I heard of it this very morning, and I told it to Miss Western; nay, I went a little beyond the truth again; for I told her you had refused her; but indeed I knew you
886
would refuse her. And here I must give you a little comfort; when I mentioned the young lady's name, who is no other than the pretty widow Hunt, I thought she turned pale; but when I said you had refused her, I will be sworn her face was all over scarlet in an instant; and these were her very words: 'I will not deny but that I believe he has some affection for me.'"
Here the conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Western, who could no longer be kept out of the room even by the authority of Allworthy himself; though this, as we have often seen, had a wonderful power over him.
Western immediately went up to Jones, crying out, "My old friend Tom, I am glad to see thee with all my heart! all past must be forgotten; I could not intend any affront to thee, because, as Allworthy here knows, nay, dost know it thyself, I took thee for another person; and where a body means no harm, what signifies a hasty word or two? One Christian must forget and forgive another." "I hope, sir," said Jones, "I shall never forget the many obligations I have had to you; but as for any offence towards me, I declare I am an utter stranger." "A't," says Western, "then give me thy fist; a't as hearty an honest cock as any in the kingdom. Come along with me; I'll carry thee to thy mistress this moment." Here Allworthy interposed; and the squire being unable to prevail either with the uncle or nephew, was, after some litigation, obliged to consent to delay introducing Jones to Sophia till the afternoon; at which time Allworthy, as well in compassion to Jones as in compliance with the eager desires of Western, was prevailed upon to promise to attend at the teatable.
The conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough; and with which, had it happened earlier in our history, we would have entertained our reader; but as we have now leisure only to attend to what is very material, it shall suffice to say that matters being entirely adjusted as to the afternoon visit Mr Western again returned home.
887
The history draws nearer to a conclusion.
When Mr Western was departed, Jones began to inform Mr Allworthy and Mrs Miller that his liberty had been procured by two noble lords, who, together with two surgeons and a friend of Mr Nightingale's, had attended the magistrate by whom he had been committed, and by whom, on the surgeons' oaths, that the wounded person was out of all manner of danger from his wound, he was discharged.
One only of these lords, he said, he had ever seen before, and that no more than once; but the other had greatly surprized him by asking his pardon for an offence he had been guilty of towards him, occasioned, he said, entirely by his ignorance who he was.
Now the reality of the case, with which Jones was not acquainted till afterwards, was this:一The lieutenant whom Lord Fellamar had employed, according to the advice of Lady Bellaston, to press Jones as a vagabond into the sea-service, when he came to report to his lordship the event which we have before seen, spoke very favourably of the behaviour of Mr Jones on all accounts, and strongly assured that lord that he must have mistaken the person, for that Jones was certainly a gentleman; insomuch that his lordship, who was strictly a man of honour, and would by no means have been guilty of an action which the world in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned for the advice which he had taken.
Within a day or two after this, Lord Fellamar happened to dine with the Irish peer, who, in a conversation upon the duel, acquainted his company with the character of Fitzpatrick; to which, indeed, he did not do strict justice, especially in what related to his lady. He said she was the most innocent, the most injured woman alive, and that from compassion alone he had undertaken her cause. He then declared an intention of going the next morning to Fitzpatrick's lodgings, in order to prevail with him, if possible, to consent to a separation from his wife, who, the peer
888
said, was in apprehensions for her life, if she should ever return to be under the power of her husband. Lord Fellamar agreed to go with him, that he might satisfy himself more concerning Jones and the circumstances of the duel; for he was by no means easy concerning the part he had acted. The moment his lordship gave a hint of his readiness to assist in the delivery of the lady, it was eagerly embraced by the other nobleman, who depended much on the authority of Lord Fellamar, as he thought it would greatly contribute to awe Fitzpatrick into a compliance; and perhaps he was in the right; for the poor Irishman no sooner saw these noble peers had undertaken the cause of his wife than he submitted, and articles of separation were soon drawn up and signed between the parties.
Fitzpatrick, who had been so well satisfied by Mrs Waters concerning the innocence of his wife with Jones at Upton, or perhaps, from some other reasons, was now become so indifferent to that matter, that he spoke highly in favour of Jones to Lord Fellamar, took all the blame upon himself, and said the other had behaved very much like a gentleman and a man of honour; and upon that lord's further enquiry concerning Mr Jones, Fitzpatrick told him he was nephew to a gentleman of very great fashion and fortune, which was the account he had just received from Mrs Waters after her interview with Dowling.
Lord Fellamar now thought it behoved him to do everything in his power to make satisfaction to a gentleman whom he had so grossly injured, and without any consideration of rivalship (for he had now given over all thoughts of Sophia), determined to procure Mr Jones's liberty, being satisfied, as well from Fitzpatrick as his surgeon, that the wound was not mortal. He therefore prevailed with the Irish peer to accompany him to the place where Jones was confined, to whom he behaved as we have already related.
When Allworthy returned to his lodgings, he immediately carried Jones into his room, and then acquainted him with the whole matter, as well what he had heard from Mrs Waters as what he had discovered from Mr Dowling.
Jones expressed great astonishment and no less concern at this account, but without making any comment or observation upon it. And now a message was brought from Mr Blifil, desiring to know if his uncle was at leisure that he might wait upon him. Allworthy started and turned pale, and then in a more passionate tone than I believe he had ever used before, bid the servant tell Blifil he knew him not. "Consider,
889
dear sir," cries Jones, in a trembling voice. "I have considered," answered Allworthy, "and you yourself shall carry my message to the villain. No one can carry him the sentence of his own ruin so properly as the man whose ruin he hath so villanously contrived." "Pardon me, dear sir," said Jones; "a moment's reflection will, I am sure, convince you of the contrary. What might perhaps be but justice from another tongue, would from mine be insult; and to whom?一my own brother and your nephew. Nor did he use me so barbarously一indeed, that would have been more inexcusable than anything he hath done. Fortune may tempt men of no very bad dispositions to injustice; but insults proceed only from black and rancorous minds, and have no temptations to excuse them. Let me beseech you, sir, to do nothing by him in the present height of your anger. Consider, my dear uncle, I was not myself condemned unheard." Allworthy stood silent a moment, and then, embracing Jones, he said, with tears gushing from his eyes, "O my child! to what goodness have I been so long blind!"
Mrs Miller entering the room at that moment, after a gentle rap which was not perceived, and seeing Jones in the arms of his uncle, the poor woman in an agony of joy fell upon her knees, and burst forth into the most ecstatic thanksgivings to heaven for what had happened; then, running to Jones, she embraced him eagerly, crying, "My dearest friend, I wish you joy a thousand and a thousand times of this blest day." And next Mr Allworthy himself received the same congratulations. To which he answered, "Indeed, indeed, Mrs Miller, I am beyond expression happy." Some few more raptures having passed on all sides, Mrs Miller desired them both to walk down to dinner in the parlour, where she said there were a very happy set of people assembled一being indeed no other than Mr Nightingale and his bride, and his cousin Harriet with her bridegroom.
Allworthy excused himself from dining with the company, saying he had ordered some little thing for him and his nephew in his own apartment, for that they had much private business to discourse of; but would not resist promising the good woman that both he and Jones would make part of her society at supper.
Mrs Miller then asked what was to be done with Blifil? "for indeed," says she, "I cannot be easy while such a villain is in my house."一Allworthy answered, "He was as uneasy as herself on the same account." "Oh!" cries she, "if that be the case, leave the matter to me, I'll soon show him the outside out of my doors, I warrant you. Here are two or three lusty fellows below-stairs." "There will be no need of any
890
violence," cries Allworthy; "if you will carry him a message from me, he will, I am convinced, depart of his own accord." "Will I?" said Mrs Miller; "I never did anything in my life with a better will." Here Jones interfered, and said, "He had considered the matter better, and would, if Mr Allworthy pleased, be himself the messenger. I know," says he, "already enough of your pleasure, sir, and I beg leave to acquaint him with it by my own words. Let me beseech you, sir," added he, "to reflect on the dreadful consequences of driving him to violent and sudden despair. How unfit, alas! is this poor man to die in his present situation." This suggestion had not the least effect on Mrs Miller. She left the room, crying, "You are too good, Mr Jones, infinitely too good to live in this world." But it made a deeper impression on Allworthy. "My good child," said he, "I am equally astonished at the goodness of your heart, and the quickness of your understanding. Heaven indeed forbid that this wretch should be deprived of any means or time for repentance! That would be a shocking consideration indeed. Go to him, therefore, and use your own discretion; yet do not flatter him with any hopes of my forgiveness; for I shall never forgive villany farther than my religion obliges me, and that extends not either to our bounty or our conversation."
Jones went up to Blifil's room, whom he found in a situation which moved his pity, though it would have raised a less amiable passion in many beholders. He cast himself on his bed, where he lay abandoning himself to despair, and drowned in tears; not in such tears as flow from contrition, and wash away guilt from minds which have been seduced or surprized into it unawares, against the bent of their natural dispositions, as will sometimes happen from human frailty, even to the good; no, these tears were such as the frighted thief sheds in his cart, and are indeed the effects of that concern which the most savage natures are seldom deficient in feeling for themselves.
It would be unpleasant and tedious to paint this scene in full length. Let it suffice to say, that the behaviour of Jones was kind to excess. He omitted nothing which his invention could supply, to raise and comfort the drooping spirits of Blifil, before he communicated to him the resolution of his uncle that he must quit the house that evening. He offered to furnish him with any money he wanted, assured him of his hearty forgiveness of all he had done against him, that he would endeavour to live with him hereafter as a brother, and would leave nothing unattempted to effectuate a reconciliation with his uncle.
Blifil was at first sullen and silent, balancing in his mind whether he should yet deny all; but, finding at last the evidence too strong against
891
him, he betook himself at last to confession. He then asked pardon of his brother in the most vehement manner, prostrated himself on the ground, and kissed his feet; in short he was now as remarkably mean as he had been before remarkably wicked.
Jones could not so far check his disdain, but that it a little discovered itself in his countenance at this extreme servility. He raised his brother the moment he could from the ground, and advised him to bear his afflictions more like a man; repeating, at the same time, his promises, that he would do all in his power to lessen them; for which Blifil, making many professions of his unworthiness, poured forth a profusion of thanks; and then, he having declared he would immediately depart to another lodging, Jones returned to his uncle.
Among other matters, Allworthy now acquainted Jones with the discovery which he had made concerning the £500 bank-notes. "I have," said he, "already consulted a lawyer, who tells me, to my great astonishment, that there is no punishment for a fraud of this kind. Indeed, when I consider the black ingratitude of this fellow toward you, I think a highwayman, compared to him, is an innocent person."
"Good Heaven!" says Jones, "is it possible?一I am shocked beyond measure at this news. I thought there was not an honester fellow in the world.-----The temptation of such a sum was too great for him to with-
stand; for smaller matters have come safe to me through his hand. Indeed, my dear uncle, you must suffer me to call it weakness rather than ingratitude; for I am convinced the poor fellow loves me, and hath done me some kindnesses, which I can never forget; nay, I believe he hath repented of this very act; for it is not above a day or two ago, when my affairs seemed in the most desperate situation, that he visited me in my confinement, and offered me any money I wanted. Consider, sir, what a temptation to a man who hath tasted such bitter distress, it must be, to have a sum in his possession which must put him and his family beyond any future possibility of suffering the like."
"Child," cries Allworthy, "you carry this forgiving temper too far. Such mistaken mercy is not only weakness, but borders on injustice, and is very pernicious to society, as it encourages vice. The dishonesty of this fellow I might, perhaps, have pardoned, but never his ingratitude. And give me leave to say, when we suffer any temptation to atone for dishonesty itself, we are as candid and merciful as we ought to be; and so far I confess I have gone; for I have often pitied the fate of a highwayman, when I have been on the grand jury; and have more than once applied to
892
the judge on the behalf of such as have had any mitigating circumstances in their case; but when dishonesty is attended with any blacker crime, such as cruelty, murder, ingratitude, or the like, compassion and forgiveness then become faults. I am convinced the fellow is a villain, and he shall be punished; at least as far as I can punish him."
This was spoken with so stern a voice, that Jones did not think proper to make any reply; besides, the hour appointed by Mr Western now drew so near, that he had barely time left to dress himself. Here therefore ended the present dialogue, and Jones retired to another room, where Partridge attended, according to order, with his cloaths.
Partridge had scarce seen his master since the happy discovery. The poor fellow was unable either to contain or express his transports. He behaved like one frantic, and made almost as many mistakes while he was dressing Jones as I have seen made by Harlequin in dressing himself on the stage.
His memory, however, was not in the least deficient. He recollected now many omens and presages of this happy event, some of which he had remarked at the time, but many more he now remembered; nor did he omit the dreams he had dreamt the evening before his meeting with Jones; and concluded with saying, "I always told your honour something boded in my mind that you would one time or other have it in your power to make my fortune." Jones assured him that this boding should as certainly be verified with regard to him as all the other omens had been to himself; which did not a little add to all the raptures which the poor fellow had already conceived on account of his master.

Chapter 且
Approaching still nearer to the end.
Jones, being now completely dressed, attended his uncle to Mr Western's. He was, indeed, one of the finest figures ever beheld, and his person alone would have charmed the greater part of womankind; but we hope it hath already appeared in this history that Nature, when she formed him, did not totally rely, as she sometimes doth, on this merit only, to recommend her work.
Sophia, who, angry as she was, was likewise set forth to the best advantage, for which I leave my female readers to account, appeared so extremely beautiful, that even Allworthy, when he saw her, could not forbear whispering Western, that he believed she was the finest creature in the world. To which Western answered, in a whisper, overheard by all present, "So much the better for Tom;一for d一n me if he shan't ha the tousling her." Sophia was all over scarlet at these words, while Tom's countenance was altogether as pale, and he was almost ready to sink from his chair.
The tea-table was scarce removed before Western lugged Allworthy out of the room, telling him he had business of consequence to impart, and must speak to him that instant in private, before he forgot it.
The lovers were now alone, and it will, I question not, appear strange to many readers, that those who had so much to say to one another when danger and difficulty attended their conversation, and who seemed so eager to rush into each other's arms when so many bars lay in their way, now that with safety they were at liberty to say or do whatever they pleased, should both remain for some time silent and motionless; insomuch that a stranger of moderate sagacity might have well concluded they were mutually indifferent; but so it was, however strange it may seem; both sat with their eyes cast downwards on the ground, and for some minutes continued in perfect silence.
894
Mr Jones during this interval attempted once or twice to speak, but was absolutely incapable, muttering only, or rather sighing out, some broken words; when Sophia at length, partly out of pity to him, and partly to turn the discourse from the subject which she knew well enough he was endeavouring to open, said一
"Sure, sir, you are the most fortunate man in the world in this discovery." "And can you really, madam, think me so fortunate," said Jones, sighing, "while I have incurred your displeasure?"一"Nay, sir," says she, "as to that you best know whether you have deserved it." "Indeed, madam," answered he, "you yourself are as well apprized of all my demerits. Mrs Miller hath acquainted you with the whole truth. O! my Sophia, am I never to hope for forgiveness?"一"I think, Mr Jones," said she, "I may almost depend on your own justice, and leave it to yourself to pass sentence on your own conduct."—"Alas! madam," answered he, "it is mercy, and not justice, which I implore at your hands. Justice I know must condemn me.一Yet not for the letter I sent to Lady Bellaston. Of that I most solemnly declare you have had a true account." He then insisted much on the security given him by Nightingale of a fair pretence for breaking off, if, contrary to their expectations, her ladyship should have accepted his offer; but confest that he had been guilty of a great indiscretion to put such a letter as that into her power, "which," said he, "I have dearly paid for, in the effect it has upon you." "I do not, I cannot," says she, "believe otherwise of that letter than you would have me. My conduct, I think, shews you clearly I do not believe there is much in that. And yet, Mr Jones, have I not enough to resent? After what past at Upton, so soon to engage in a new amour with another woman, while I fancied, and you pretended, your heart was bleeding for me? Indeed, you have acted strangely. Can I believe the passion you have profest to me to be sincere? Or, if I can, what happiness can I assure myself of with a man capable of so much inconstancy?" "O! my Sophia," cries he, "do not doubt the sincerity of the purest passion that ever inflamed a human breast. Think, most adorable creature, of my unhappy situation, of my despair. Could I, my Sophia, have flattered myself with the most distant hopes of being ever permitted to throw myself at your feet in the manner I do now, it would not have been in the power of any other woman to have inspired a thought which the severest chastity could have condemned. Inconstancy to you! O Sophia! if you can have goodness enough to pardon what is past, do not let any cruel future apprehensions shut your mercy against me. No repentance was ever more sincere. O! let it reconcile me to my heaven in this dear bosom." "Sincere repentance,
895
Mr Jones," answered she, "will obtain the pardon of a sinner, but it is from one who is a perfect judge of that sincerity. A human mind may be imposed on; nor is there any infallible method to prevent it. You must expect, however, that if I can be prevailed on by your repentance to pardon you, I will at least insist on the strongest proof of its sincerity." "Name any proof in my power," answered Jones eagerly. "Time," replied she; "time alone, Mr Jones, can convince me that you are a true penitent, and have resolved to abandon these vicious courses, which I should detest you for, if I imagined you capable of persevering in them." "Do not imagine it," cries Jones. "On my knees I intreat, I implore your confidence, a confidence which it shall be the business of my life to deserve." "Let it then," said she, "be the business of some part of your life to shew me you deserve it. I think I have been explicit enough in assuring you, that, when I see you merit my confidence, you will obtain it. After what is past, sir, can you expect I should take you upon your word?"
He replied, "Don't believe me upon my word; I have a better security, a pledge for my constancy, which it is impossible to see and to doubt." "What is that?" said Sophia, a little surprized. "I will show you, my charming angel," cried Jones, seizing her hand and carrying her to the glass. "There, behold it there in that lovely figure, in that face, that shape, those eyes, that mind which shines through these eyes; can the man who shall be in possession of these be inconstant? Impossible! my Sophia; they would fix a Dorimant, a Lord Rochester. You could not doubt it, if you could see yourself with any eyes but your own." Sophia blushed and half smiled; but, forcing again her brow into a frown一"If I am to judge," said she, "of the future by the past, my image will no more remain in your heart when I am out of your sight, than it will in this glass when I am out of the room." "By heaven, by all that is sacred!" said Jones, "it never was out of my heart. The delicacy of your sex cannot conceive the grossness of ours, nor how little one sort of amour has to do with the heart." "I will never marry a man," replied Sophia, very gravely, "who shall not learn refinement enough to be as incapable as I am myself of making such a distinction." "I will learn it," said Jones. "I have learnt it already. The first moment of hope that my Sophia might be my wife taught it me at once; and all the rest of her sex from that moment became as little the objects of desire to my sense as of passion to my heart." "Well," says Sophia, "the proof of this must be from time. Your situation, Mr Jones, is now altered, and I assure you I have great satisfaction in the alteration. You will now want no opportunity of being near me, and convincing me that your mind is altered too." "O! my angel," cries Jones,
896
"how shall I thank thy goodness! And are you so good to own that you have a satisfaction in my prosperity?------Believe me, believe me,
madam, it is you alone have given a relish to that prosperity, since I owe to it the dear hope--O! my Sophia, let it not be a distant one.一I will be
all obedience to your commands. I will not dare to press anything further than you permit me. Yet let me intreat you to appoint a short trial. O! tell me when I may expect you will be convinced of what is most solemnly true." "When I have gone voluntarily thus far, Mr Jones," said she, "I expect not to be pressed. Nay, I will not."—"O! don't look unkindly thus, my Sophia," cries he. "I do not, I dare not press you.一Yet permit me at least once more to beg you would fix the period. O! consider the impatience of love."一"A twelvemonth, perhaps," said she. "O! my Sophia," cries he, "you have named an eternity."一"Perhaps it may be something sooner," says she; "I will not be teazed. If your passion for me be what I would have it, I think you may now be easy."一"Easy! Sophia, call not such an exulting happiness as mine by so cold a name.----O!
transporting thought! am I not assured that the blessed day will come, when I shall call you mine; when fears shall be no more; when I shall have that dear, that vast, that exquisite, ecstatic delight of making my Sophia happy?"一"Indeed, sir," said she, "that day is in your own power."一"O! my dear, my divine angel," cried he, "these words have made me mad with joy.-----But I must, I will thank those dear lips which
have so sweetly pronounced my bliss." He then caught her in his arms, and kissed her with an ardour he had never ventured before.
At this instant Western, who had stood some time listening, burst into the room, and, with his hunting voice and phrase, cried out, "To her, boy, to her, go to her.-That's it, little honeys, O that's it! Well! what, is it all
over? Hath she appointed the day, boy? What, shall it be to-morrow or next day? It shan't be put off a minute longer than next day, I am resolved." "Let me beseech you, sir," says Jones, "don't let me be the occasion"----"Beseech mine a-----," cries Western. "I thought thou hadst
been a lad of higher mettle than to give way to a parcel of maidenish tricks.--1 tell thee 'tis all flimflam. Zoodikers! she'd have the wedding
to-night with all her heart. Would'st not, Sophy? Come, confess, and be an honest girl for once. What, art dumb? Why dost not speak?" "Why should I confess, sir," says Sophia, "since it seems you are so well acquainted with my thoughts?"-----"That's a good girl," cries he, "and dost
consent then?" "No, indeed, sir," says Sophia, "I have given no such con-sent."一"And wunt not ha un then to-morrow, nor next day?" says Western.一"Indeed, sir," says she, "I have no such intention." "But I can
897
tell thee," replied he, "why hast nut; only because thou dost love to be disobedient, and to plague and vex thy father." "Pray, sir," said Jones, interfering---"I tell thee thou art a puppy," cries he. "When I vorbid her,
then it was all nothing but sighing and whining, and languishing and writing; now I am vor thee, she is against thee. All the spirit of contrary, that's all. She is above being guided and governed by her father, that is the whole truth on't. It is only to disoblige and contradict me." "What would my papa have me do?" cries Sophia. "What would I ha thee do?" says he, "why, gi' un thy hand this moment."一"Well, sir," says Sophia, "I will obey you.—There is my hand, Mr Jones." "Well, and will you consent to ha un to-morrow morning?" says Western.一"I will be obedient to you, sir," cries she.—"Why then to-morrow morning be the day," cries he. "Why then to-morrow morning shall be the day, papa, since you will have it so," says Sophia. Jones then fell upon his knees, and kissed her hand in an agony of joy, while Western began to caper and dance about the room, presently crying out—"Where the devil is Allworthy? He is without now, a talking with that d一d lawyer Dowling, when he should be minding other matters." He then sallied out in quest of him, and very opportunely left the lovers to enjoy a few tender minutes alone.
But he soon returned with Allworthy, saying, "If you won't believe me, you may ask her yourself. Hast nut gin thy consent, Sophy, to be married to-morrow?" "Such are your commands, sir," cries Sophia, "and I dare not be guilty of disobedience." "I hope, madam," cries Allworthy, "my nephew will merit so much goodness, and will be always as sensible as myself of the great honour you have done my family. An alliance with so charming and so excellent a young lady would indeed be an honour to the greatest in England." "Yes," cries Western, "but if I had suffered her to stand shill I shall I, dilly dally, you might not have had that honour yet a while; I was forced to use a little fatherly authority to bring her to." "I hope not, sir," cries Allworthy, "I hope there is not the least constraint." "Why, there," cries Western, "you may bid her unsay all again if you will. Dost repent heartily of thy promise, dost not, Sophia?" "Indeed, papa," cries she, "I do not repent, nor do I believe I ever shall, of any promise in favour of Mr Jones." "Then, nephew," cries Allworthy, "I felicitate you most heartily; for I think you are the happiest of men. And, madam, you will give me leave to congratulate you on this joyful occasion: indeed, I am convinced you have bestowed yourself on one who will be sensible of your great merit, and who will at least use his best endeavours to deserve it." "His best endeavours!" cries Western, "that he will, I warrant un.----Harkee, Allworthy, I'll bet thee five pounds to a crown we have a
898
boy to-morrow nine months; but prithee tell me what wut ha! Wut ha Burgundy, Champaigne, or what? for, please Jupiter, we'll make a night on't." "Indeed, sir," said Allworthy, "you must excuse me; both my nephew and I were engaged before I suspected this near approach of his hap-piness."一"Engaged!" quoth the squire, "never tell me.一I won't part with thee to-night upon any occasion. Shalt sup here, please the lord Harry." "You must pardon me, my dear neighbour!" answered Allworthy; "I have given a solemn promise, and that you know I never break." "Why, prithee, who art engaged to?" cries the squire.--Allworthy then informed him, as likewise of the company.----------"Odzookers!" answered the
squire, "I will go with thee, and so shall Sophy! for I won't part with thee to-night; and it would be barbarous to part Tom and the girl." This offer was presently embraced by Allworthy, and Sophia consented, having first obtained a private promise from her father that he would not mention a syllable concerning her marriage.

Chapter 且 U
In which the history is concluded.
Young Nightingale had been that afternoon, by appointment, to wait on his father, who received him much more kindly than he expected. There likewise he met his uncle, who was returned to town in quest of his new-married daughter.
This marriage was the luckiest incident which could have happened to the young gentleman; for these brothers lived in a constant state of contention about the government of their children, both heartily despising the method which each other took. Each of them therefore now endeavoured, as much as he could, to palliate the offence which his own child had committed, and to aggravate the match of the other. This desire of triumphing over his brother, added to the many arguments which Allworthy had used, so strongly operated on the old gentleman that he met his son with a smiling countenance, and actually agreed to sup with him that evening at Mrs Miller's.
As for the other, who really loved his daughter with the most immoderate affection, there was little difficulty in inclining him to a reconciliation. He was no sooner informed by his nephew where his daughter and her husband were, than he declared he would instantly go to her. And when he arrived there he scarce suffered her to fall upon her knees before he took her up, and embraced her with a tenderness which affected all who saw him; and in less than a quarter of an hour was as well reconciled to both her and her husband as if he had himself joined their hands.
In this situation were affairs when Mr Allworthy and his company arrived to complete the happiness of Mrs Miller, who no sooner saw Sophia than she guessed everything that had happened; and so great was her friendship to Jones, that it added not a few transports to those she felt on the happiness of her own daughter.
900
There have not, I believe, been many instances of a number of people met together, where every one was so perfectly happy as in this company. Amongst whom the father of young Nightingale enjoyed the least perfect content; for, notwithstanding his affection for his son, notwithstanding the authority and the arguments of Allworthy, together with the other motive mentioned before, he could not so entirely be satisfied with his son's choice; and, perhaps, the presence of Sophia herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his concern, as a thought now and then suggested itself that his son might have had that lady, or some other such. Not that any of the charms which adorned either the person or mind of Sophia created the uneasiness; it was the contents of her father's coffers which set his heart a longing. These were the charms which he could not bear to think his son had sacrificed to the daughter of Mrs Miller.
The brides were both very pretty women; but so totally were they eclipsed by the beauty of Sophia, that, had they not been two of the best-tempered girls in the world, it would have raised some envy in their breasts; for neither of their husbands could long keep his eyes from Sophia, who sat at the table like a queen receiving homage, or, rather, like a superior being receiving adoration from all around her. But it was an adoration which they gave, not which she exacted; for she was as much distinguished by her modesty and affability as by all her other perfections.
The evening was spent in much true mirth. All were happy, but those the most who had been most unhappy before. Their former sufferings and fears gave such a relish to their felicity as even love and fortune, in their fullest flow, could not have given without the advantage of such a comparison. Yet, as great joy, especially after a sudden change and revolution of circumstances, is apt to be silent, and dwells rather in the heart than on the tongue, Jones and Sophia appeared the least merry of the whole company; which Western observed with great impatience, often crying out to them, "Why dost not talk, boy? Why dost look so grave? Hast lost thy tongue, girl? Drink another glass of wine; sha't drink another glass." And, the more to enliven her, he would sometimes sing a merry song, which bore some relation to matrimony and the loss of a maidenhead. Nay, he would have proceeded so far on that topic as to have driven her out of the room, if Mr Allworthy had not checkt him, sometimes by looks, and once or twice by a "Fie! Mr Western!" He began, indeed, once to debate the matter, and assert his right to talk to his own
901
daughter as he thought fit; but, as nobody seconded him, he was soon reduced to order.
Notwithstanding this little restraint, he was so pleased with the chear-fulness and good-humour of the company, that he insisted on their meeting the next day at his lodgings. They all did so; and the lovely Sophia, who was now in private become a bride too, officiated as the mistress of the ceremonies, or, in the polite phrase, did the honours of the table. She had that morning given her hand to Jones, in the chapel at Doctors'-Commons, where Mr Allworthy, Mr Western, and Mrs Miller, were the only persons present.
Sophia had earnestly desired her father that no others of the company, who were that day to dine with him, should be acquainted with her marriage. The same secrecy was enjoined to Mrs Miller, and Jones undertook for Allworthy. This somewhat reconciled the delicacy of Sophia to the public entertainment which, in compliance with her father's will, she was obliged to go to, greatly against her own inclinations. In confidence of this secrecy she went through the day pretty well, till the squire, who was now advanced into the second bottle, could contain his joy no longer, but, filling out a bumper, drank a health to the bride. The health was immediately pledged by all present, to the great confusion of our poor blushing Sophia, and the great concern of Jones upon her account. To say truth, there was not a person present made wiser by this discovery; for Mrs Miller had whispered it to her daughter, her daughter to her husband, her husband to his sister, and she to all the rest.
Sophia now took the first opportunity of withdrawing with the ladies, and the squire sat in to his cups, in which he was, by degrees, deserted by all the company except the uncle of young Nightingale, who loved his bottle as well as Western himself. These two, therefore, sat stoutly to it during the whole evening, and long after that happy hour which had surrendered the charming Sophia to the eager arms of her enraptured Jones.
Thus, reader, we have at length brought our history to a conclusion, in which, to our great pleasure, though contrary, perhaps, to thy expectation, Mr Jones appears to be the happiest of all humankind; for what happiness this world affords equal to the possession of such a woman as Sophia, I sincerely own I have never yet discovered.
As to the other persons who have made any considerable figure in this history, as some may desire to know a little more concerning them, we will proceed, in as few words as possible, to satisfy their curiosity.
902
Allworthy hath never yet been prevailed upon to see Blifil, but he hath yielded to the importunity of Jones, backed by Sophia, to settle £200 a-year upon him; to which Jones hath privately added a third. Upon this income he lives in one of the northern counties, about 200 miles distant from London, and lays up £200 a-year out of it, in order to purchase a seat in the next parliament from a neighbouring borough, which he has bargained for with an attourney there. He is also lately turned Methodist, in hopes of marrying a very rich widow of that sect, whose estate lies in that part of the kingdom.
Square died soon after he writ the before-mentioned letter; and as to Thwackum, he continues at his vicarage. He hath made many fruitless attempts to regain the confidence of Allworthy, or to ingratiate himself with Jones, both of whom he flatters to their faces, and abuses behind their backs. But in his stead, Mr Allworthy hath lately taken Mr Abraham Adams into his house, of whom Sophia is grown immoderately fond, and declares he shall have the tuition of her children.
Mrs Fitzpatrick is separated from her husband, and retains the little remains of her fortune. She lives in reputation at the polite end of the town, and is so good an economist, that she spends three times the income of her fortune, without running into debt. She maintains a perfect intimacy with the lady of the Irish peer; and in acts of friendship to her repays all obligations she owes her husband.
Mrs Western was soon reconciled to her niece Sophia, and hath spent two months together with her in the country. Lady Bellaston made the latter a formal visit at her return to town, where she behaved to Jones as a perfect stranger, and, with great civility, wished him joy on his marriage.
Mr Nightingale hath purchased an estate for his son in the neighbourhood of Jones, where the young gentleman, his lady, Mrs Miller, and her little daughter reside, and the most agreeable intercourse subsists between the two families.
As to those of lower account, Mrs Waters returned into the country, had a pension of £60 a-year settled upon her by Mr Allworthy, and is married to Parson Supple, on whom, at the instance of Sophia, Western hath bestowed a considerable living.
Black George, hearing the discovery that had been made, ran away, and was never since heard of; and Jones bestowed the money on his family, but not in equal proportions, for Molly had much the greatest share.
903
As for Partridge, Jones hath settled £50 a-year on him; and he hath again set up a school, in which he meets with much better encouragement than formerly, and there is now a treaty of marriage on foot between him and Miss Molly Seagrim, which, through the mediation of Sophia, is likely to take effect.
We now return to take leave of Mr Jones and Sophia, who, within two days after their marriage, attended Mr Western and Mr Allworthy into the country. Western hath resigned his family seat, and the greater part of his estate, to his son-in-law, and hath retired to a lesser house of his in another part of the country, which is better for hunting. Indeed, he is often as a visitant with Mr Jones, who, as well as his daughter, hath an infinite delight in doing everything in their power to please him. And this desire of theirs is attended with such success, that the old gentleman declares he was never happy in his life till now. He hath here a parlour and ante-chamber to himself, where he gets drunk with whom he pleases: and his daughter is still as ready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it; for Jones hath assured her that, as, next to pleasing her, one of his highest satisfactions is to contribute to the happiness of the old man; so, the great duty which she expresses and performs to her father, renders her almost equally dear to him with the love which she bestows on himself.
Sophia hath already produced him two fine children, a boy and a girl, of whom the old gentleman is so fond, that he spends much of his time in the nursery, where he declares the tattling of his little grand-daughter, who is above a year and a half old, is sweeter music than the finest cry of dogs in England.
Allworthy was likewise greatly liberal to Jones on the marriage, and hath omitted no instance of shewing his affection to him and his lady, who love him as a father. Whatever in the nature of Jones had a tendency to vice, has been corrected by continual conversation with this good man, and by his union with the lovely and virtuous Sophia. He hath also, by reflection on his past follies, acquired a discretion and prudence very uncommon in one of his lively parts.
To conclude, as there are not to be found a worthier man and woman, than this fond couple, so neither can any be imagined more happy. They preserve the purest and tenderest affection for each other, an affection daily encreased and confirmed by mutual endearments and mutual esteem. Nor is their conduct towards their relations and friends less amiable than towards one another. And such is their condescension, their
904
indulgence, and their beneficence to those below them, that there is not a neighbour, a tenant, or a servant, who doth not most gratefully bless the day when Mr Jones was married to his Sophia.
FINIS.

献辞
献给
财政五卿之一，尊贵的乔治•李特顿［1］先生
先生！
当我请求把您的名字题在这篇献辞之前的时候，您曾一再拒绝。尽管 如此，我还是坚持这一个权利一一要求您做这部作品的保护者。
先生，多亏您的启发，这部历史才得动笔。我最初想到写这样一部 书，也是由于您的愿望。事隔多年，您或许已经忘却这段经过了。但是对 我来说，您的愿望就等于命令，我当永志不忘。
如果没有您的帮助，这部历史也永不会写成。请您不要诧异。我并不 想使您蒙上小说家的嫌疑，我不过是说，在我写这部作品的大半时间里， 一部分是由于您的接济才得以衣食无缺的。这是我必须提醒您的另一点， 因为有些事情您非常健忘，但对于这些事，我希望我永远比您记得更牢。
最后，也是亏了您，这部历史才写成现在这个样子。正像某些人所乐 于指出的，如果这部作品比旁的作品更加鲜明地描绘出一颗真正仁慈的 心，那么，无论您的新知或者旧友，谁还会怀疑那种仁慈是从什么地方模 拟下来的呢？我相信人们不会那么恭维我，说我是以自己为蓝本而写的。
人们将承认我所模拟的两位一一人间最善良、最可敬的两位⑵是我的至交好 友。这一点我是不会在意的。本来我应该就此知足了，然而虚荣心又促使 我添上第三位；这一位，不仅出身贵胄，而且在每一桩公德私行中，全是 最伟大最高贵的人物之一。但在这里，当我从心坎上对贝德福公爵［3］的厚遇 发出感激之情时，请恕我提醒您：最初还是您把我介绍给这位恩人的。
那么，我恳求您接受这份光荣，您又有什么理由来拒绝呢？您既然曾 那么热烈地赞赏过这部作品，怎么会不好意思在它的献辞前头看到自己的 名字呢。说实在的，先生，如果作品本身不曾使您不好意思加以赞赏，那 么这里所写的任何话既不会也不应使您感到不好意思。我不会因为您曾赞 赏过这部作品就放弃受到您保护四和庇佑的权利。因为尽管我承认欠您许多 情分，但我并没把您对我的作品的赞赏计算在内。我深信友谊在这上头不 曾起什么作用，因为友谊既不能左右您的判断力，也不能破坏您的公正。 只要确乎值得，连一个仇人的作品也随时可以获得您的赞赏，而倘若您的 朋友有了过失，充其量只能指望您保持缄默；或者如果他受到的责备过于 严厉，就希望您稍微替他缓和一下。
简而言之，我估计您之所以拒绝我这个恳求，其实是由于您不喜欢公 开受到颂扬。我理会您同另外那两位朋友一样，也不愿听到人家称道您的 任何美德。您，正如一位大诗人［5］歌颂你们三位中间的一位（其实对三位都 可以适用）时所说的：
暗中行善事，赧然愧人知。
如果具有这种品格的人在颂扬面前退避三舍，就像别人怕受到责难一 样，那么您担心您的盛德懿行落到我的笔尖底下会将如何，当然担心得有 道理。如果一个人成为一位作家抨击的对象，而他加给这位作家的损害就 如我受您的恩惠一样深重，他又怎么能不害怕呢？
而且，如果一个人明白自己曾为攻击者提供过攻击的口实，他对攻击 的惧怕岂不会相应地增加吗？举例来说，如果他整个一生不断成为讽刺的 资料，那么一旦他落到他所得罪过的讽刺作家手里，自然会胆战心惊的。 先生，现在如果我们把这种情形应用到您憎恶颂扬的谦虚态度上，那么您 对我的害怕自是很有道理！
可是，我向您担保，我永远首先遵循您的意旨，其次才去满足自己的 愿望。这样，您就一定肯于满足我这奢望了。我要在这篇献辞里给您一个 确实的保证，我决心仿效所有献辞作者的办法，不去考虑我的保护者身上 有什么真正值得写下来的，而是考虑他最乐意谈到什么。
开场白就到此为止。现在谨将我几年来的劳动成果奉献给您。至于它 有些什么价值，您自己早已知晓。如果由于获得您的好评，我对它做出一 定的估价，那也不能归之于虚荣，因为即使您赞赏的是旁人的作品，我也 一定完全同意您的见解。反之，至少可以这么说，如果我觉察到这部作品 有什么重大缺点，我就无论如何也不会冒昧地请您来保护它。
我希望开始谈我这部作品的读者从我的保护人的名字也可以相信，他 在全书里不会遇到任何有伤宗教和道德的东西，任何不符合最谨严的礼数 的东西，也不会遇到任何使最纯洁的眼睛感到肮脏的东西。恰恰相反，我 真诚努力在这部历史中要做到的乃是扬善举德，而您也曾欣然认为我已经 达到了这个正当的目的。老实说，只有在这一类书籍里才最有可能做到扬 善举德，因为一个模范人物是这样一幅图画，其长处就成为大家视线的目 标，引起我们的美感，按照柏拉图的说法，那是道德所具有的掩饰不住的 魅力。
除了展示这种道德之美以吸引人们憧憬之外，我还试图以一个更强大 的动力来促使人们向往道德，使人们相信，从实际的利益着想也应当去追 求它。为着这一目的，我在作品里表明凭恶行而得到的好处决不足以补偿 内心所失去的真正的安乐，那种安乐乃是率真和美德的天然伴侣；也丝毫 不足以抵偿我们胸中由罪恶所生的恐怖和忧虑。其次，我还指出那些不义 的攫得本身往往不值一文，而所采用的手段不仅卑鄙龌龊，并且也极不可 靠，总是岌岌难保。最后，我竭力劝导人们，除非由于轻举妄动，美德和 率真是损害不了的。只有轻举妄动才往往会把率真和美德引入欺诈和奸邪 为它安排的陷阱中去。我所以不遗余力地宣扬这一教训，因为我觉得这个 教训是人们最有可能听得进去的。我相信使好人变得审慎要比坏人变好容 易得多。
为了这些目的，我在下面这部历史里，凭着我所能运用的一切才智和 幽默，力图以讽刺嘲笑来把人们从他们所喜爱的愚蠢及邪恶中挽救出来。 这桩好事我做得究竟有多大成效，尚请公正的读者裁夺。这里，我只提出 两点要求：第一，请不要预期这部作品已经做到+全+美；第二，如果有
些部分并没有显示出我在别的部分所希望显示出来的一些优点，也请多包 涵。
先生，不再絮烦下去了。我明明说是只题几句献辞，却写成一篇序文 了。然而此外我又有什么办法呢？我不敢赞美您；当我想着您的时候，为 了做到不去赞美您，我只晓得一个排遣的法子：要么就完全缄默，要么就 把我的思绪转到旁的题目上去。
我这里所写的不仅未得您同意，而且完全违反您的意旨，因此，请您 宽恕。无论如何请容许我以最大的敬意和最深的感激，公开宣称我是您的 受惠至深、最顺从、最谦卑的仆人。

第一卷
在这部历史的开头，先把读者所 必须知道和宜于知道的、有
关弃儿出生的神种情景,
尽量介绍一下
第一章
本书的开场白一一或者说，为这桌酒席开的菜单
—个作家不应以宴会的东道主或舍饭的慈善家自居，他毋宁应该把自 己看作一个饭铺的老板，只要出钱来吃，一律欢迎。大家都晓得，在前一 种情况下，设宴的主人高兴准备什么饭菜，就准备什么；即使客人吃来淡 然无味，甚至十分不合胃口，也不便有所挑剔。岂止如此，不管主人摆上 些什么，他们拘于礼貌，表面上还不得不满口称赞。对一个开饭馆子的老 板，那可就是另一回事了。花钱来吃饭的人，不管口味有多么考究，多么 难以捉摸，也非坚持得到满足不可。倘使不是样样菜全合胃口，那他们就 认为有权毫不留情地指责、谩骂，甚至诅咒。
因此，诚实而善意的老板为了免得开罪顾客，叫他们吃得不如意，总 准备下一张菜单，他们一进门就可以仔细过目。这样，他们可以晓得在这 里究竟能吃到些什么饭菜，合则留下来，饱餐一顿；不合，也可以去光顾 另外一家更合他们口味的饭馆。
不论何人，只要有些乖巧或明智之处足供我们借镜，我们都愿向他们 讨教。因此，我们也不耻于跟这些诚实的饭铺老板们学学乖：我们不但为 这整桌酒席开出一张总菜单，并且也将在本卷及以后各卷里，每上一道 菜，必为读者先分别开出菜单来。
这里替读者准备下的食品不是别的，乃是人性。尽管贤明的读者口味极 其讲究，我也并不担心他们会因为我仅仅报了一道菜而诧异、挑眼，甚至 不高兴。甲鱼除了鲜美的鳖黄和鳖胶以外，还有种种味道不同的肉一一这 一层，那位对饮食之道研究有素的布里斯托尔［1］郡长大人，凭着丰富的经 验，是很了解的。同样，渊博的读者不会不晓得在"人性"这个总名称下面 也包含着千变万化。一位作家要想将人性这么广阔的一个题材写尽，比一 位厨师把世界上各种肉类和蔬菜都做成菜肴还困难得多。
那些口味高的人士也许会嫌这道菜太粗俗，太普通了，坊间那些传 奇、小说、戏剧、诗歌里所描绘的，不都是这个人性吗？美食家倘使动辄 因为在穷街陋巷遇到的也叫这个名字，就斥为粗俗，他们必然会错过许多 珍馐美味。老实说，真实的人性在作家笔下之不多见，正如在店铺里轻易 买不到巴荣纳⑵火腿或波洛尼亚回香肠一样。
不过，如果继续使用这个比喻的话，关键还是在于作者烹调的手艺。 正像蒲伯先生告诉我们的：
真才华能使大自然显得更姣好， 它常能为人领略，却难以言表。［4］
同是一头牲畜身上的肉，有的部分可以荣登公爵之席，另外一部分却 降了格，有一两条腿还会倒挂在市井最肮脏的摊子上，好像是拿来示众。 倘若达官贵人与贩夫走卒吃的同是一头公牛或仔牛身上的肉，那么，还有 什么区别呢？区别在于调味、烹饪、搭配和装盘手艺。因此，甲桌菜足以 引得食欲不振的跃跃欲试，乙桌菜却连那食欲最旺盛的也感到淡而无味， 倒胃口。
同样，精神筵席的优劣与其说是在于题材本身，毋宁说是在于作者烹 调的技术。在这部作品里，我们遵循着当代、甚至从赫立欧嘎巴勒斯［5］时代 以来最卓越的一位名厨师［6］的一条最高原则。读者一旦知道了这一点，该会 多么满意啊！讲究吃喝的人们全都熟知：这位大师总是先给空着肚子的客 人摆出一些家常菜肴，随着客人的胃口越来越小，他就逐渐端出最精致的 汤汁和调味香料来。我们同样也先托出乡村习见的那种较为平凡、朴质的 人性，以飨胃口旺盛的读者，然后再用宫廷和都会所提供的那些造作、罪 恶等等法国和意大利式的上好佐料，加以清炒或红烧。我们深信，这样就 足以使读者看个不忍释卷，一如前边谈的那位大厨师使客人吃个不厌一 样。
这段话交代完毕，眼下不再耽搁那些看中我们这张菜单的顾客了，我 们立刻就端上这部历史的第一道菜来，请大家享用。
第二章
简单介绍一下乡绅奥尔华绥，较为详细地介绍他的妹妹白丽洁■奥 尔华绥4'姐
不久以前，在我国西部通称作萨默塞特郡的地方，有一位绅士（他现 在也许还住在那里），名叫奥尔华绥。这位先生很可以说是造物和命运的 宠儿。这二者似乎在比赛，看谁为他降福更多，谁使他受惠更深。有人觉 得造物在这场比赛中似乎占了上风，它赐与奥尔华绥许多礼物，而命运能 赠予的却只有一宗。尽管如此，命运给的却也极其丰厚，以致另外一些人 又认为，她这一宗礼物比起造物所赐与的总和还要多。奥尔华绥从前者得 到的是堂堂的仪表，健壮的体质，卓越的见识和一副仁慈的心肠。后者为 他安排下的，是继承郡里最大的家业之一。
这位先生年轻时候娶过一位品貌双全的小姐，他对她宠爱非常。她给 他生了三个孩子，却都在襁褓中夭折了。尤其不幸的是，在这部历史开始 前五个年头光景，他又埋葬了他那位亲爱的夫人。尽管这一损失非同小 可，他却像一切通情达理、坚贞不渝的人那样忍受下来。然而我们不能不 承认，每逢谈到这些，他的话总有些颠三倒四：有时候说，他并不认为自 己是个鳏夫，他的妻子只不过是出去旅行一趟，比他先走了几步，他迟早 总要跟上去的，他也毫不怀疑他将在他们永不再分离的地方和她重新聚 首。左近四邻听到他这些话，有的说他神经错乱，有的怪他信教不虔诚， 还有人责备他言不由衷。
眼下，大部分时间他都跟一个妹妹隐居在乡间。他对妹妹十分爱护。 这位小姐今年已经三十开外，在尖酸刻薄的人看来，女人到了这般年龄， 称作老处女也没什么不妥当了。这位小姐属于妇女界一般说的“规矩女 人"一一女读者们，再没有她那么规矩的人了。这种女人您与其夸奖她的姿 容，倒不如颂扬她的德行。老实说，她非但不把缺乏美貌看作什么遗憾， 而且每逢提到这个优点（如果生得漂亮能算个优点的话），还总摆出一副 轻蔑的神态。她时常感谢上帝幸亏自己长得没有某小姐那么漂亮，某小姐 大概就是因为生得漂亮，才犯下了过失，否则她本来是可以避免的。白丽 洁•奥尔华绥小姐（这就是那位小姐的名字）想的不错：一个女人要是长得 标致，无论对己对人都不外乎是个陷阱。尽管白丽洁小姐并不漂亮，可她 一举一动还是小心谨慎，处处留神，仿佛自己随时都面临着堕入为所有女
性设下的各种陷阱的危险。其实，尽管读者们也许觉得难以理解，依我 看，"谨慎”这个卫兵，就像训练有素的警备队一样，总是急于到危险最小 的地方去值勤。实际上，对于男人所倾心渴慕、为之憔悴叹息、害相思 病、并且千方百计布下情网来谋求的那些美貌绝伦的女人，"谨慎”往往卑 鄙胆怯地抛下不管，却经常守卫着那些德行更高的女人一一也就是说，那 些男人敬而远之（想必因为没有成功的希望），从来不敢追求的女人。
读者诸君，在咱们同程共进之前，我觉得应该说明一下：在这部历史 的全部进程中，我打算不时地离开正文，发些议论。至于什么地方才相 宜，这一层我本人比任何浅薄无知的批评家更能判断。这里，我要求他们 别多管闲事，对于与他们无关的事少来插嘴。在他们没树立起法官的威信 以前，我是决不请他们来裁判的。
第三章
奥尔华绥先生_回家就碰上一桩怪事;德波拉■威尔根斯大娘合乎 体统的举止，以及她对私生子正当的谴责
在前一章里，我已告诉读者奥尔华绥先生继承了一笔可观的遗产，也 谈到他心地善良，家里没有了妻小，从而大家必然会推想到他过的是个本 分人的生活：不欠谁一个铜板，也不妄取分文；十分好客，总殷勤招待街 坊四邻，并且经常用残羹剩饭赒济穷人一一即是说，那些宁愿乞讨而不愿 工作的人。他身后留下不少遗产，盖起一座医院。
他确乎做过许多这类事情。不过，倘若除去这些再没别的，那么，就 让他把这些善行刻在医院大门上边一块漂亮的石板上也尽够了。载入这部 历史的事情要比那突出得多，否则写这么卷帙浩繁的作品就未免太浪费时 光了；而您，贤明的读者，如果去浏览一下某些诙谐作家戏称作"英国 史”的那一类著作，也许可以得到同样的裨益和乐趣。
奥尔华绥先生为了一桩要事，在伦敦逗留了整整三个月，究竟为什么 事却不得而知；但是多年来他从没整月离家外出过，这回却走了这么多日 子，足见事情非同小可。那天晚上他回到家里，天已经不早了。兄妹俩草 草用过晚饭，他感到疲倦异常，就来到自己的卧房，做了几分钟的祷告 （不论在什么情况下，这个习惯他从没中断过），然后就准备上床安歇。 掀开被子他吓了一跳，原来被窝里有个用粗布裹着的娃娃，睡得又香又 甜。这情景使他愣了好一阵子。仁慈在他胸膛里一向是占上风的，看到眼 前这个小可怜儿，他很快就动了恻隐之心。奥尔华绥先生摇了摇铃，吩咐 马上喊起上了年纪的管家婆，请她到他房里来。睡着的婴儿的红润小脸， 十分天真可爱。这时，他为欣赏孩子生得俊秀而出神，竟然忘记身上只穿 着衬衣衬裤。其实，时间本很从容，因为管家婆出于对东家的尊重，也为 了保持体统，尽管仆人催得急如星火，并且说也许东家猝然中了风，或得 了旁的急症，眼看就要一命呜呼，她还是对着镜子整理了好半天头发。
一个如此重视穿戴齐整的女人，看到旁人在这方面稍有疏忽，便会大 为震惊，这原不足为奇。所以威尔根斯大娘推开门，-望到主人站在床 前，身穿衬衣衬裤，手里拿着蜡烛，就赶紧往后一退，吓得缩成一团。要 不是东家这时想起自己曾经脱掉衣服，马上关照她在内外稍等片刻，容他 披上点东西，使她那对纯洁的眼睛不至受惊，她也许会晕倒呢。尽管这位
德波拉•威尔根斯大娘今年已经五十有二了，但她赌咒说，生平还没见过一 个脱掉外衣的男人。说话刻薄或放肆的人也许会讥笑她最初那阵恐怖，可 是严肃的读者倘若理会到那正是夜静更深时分，她又是现从床上给喊起来 的，再加上她看到东家那般情景，就会认为德波拉大娘那样子完全是理所 当然的，并对她大为称赞，除非读者认为，女人到了德波拉大娘那把岁数 本应该变得老练一些，又会认为她并没那么值得称赞了。
当德波拉大娘重新走进房间，听东家说发现了一个小娃娃，她比刚才 奥尔华绥先生还要吃惊，声调神色都有些张皇失措，禁不住喊道："这可怎 么办呀，我的好老爷！"奥尔华绥先生对她说，当天晚上那娃娃得交她照 看，等第二天早上他再叫人去找个奶妈来。"好吧，老爷，"她说，"我还希 望老爷出张拘票孔把养这孩子的那个下贱女人抓起来，她准就住在附近这 —带。看到她给关进教养所圆，绑在大车后头挨鞭子，我才痛快哩。真的， 怎么惩办这种骚货也不算过分。我敢担保她这绝不是第一遭，不然的话， 她不会胆敢赖到老爷您的头上来。""什么？德波拉，赖到我的头上来！"奥 尔华绥回答说，"我倒不认为她有这种打算。她这么做只不过是为了替孩子 找个收养的地方。老实说，我倒高兴她没干出更坏的事来。""这个浪婊子 把自己养下的孽种推到正经人家的内前，"德波拉嚷道，"我不知道还能有 什么比这更坏的了；尽管老爷您晓得自己一身清白，世人的嘴可是从不饶 人的。就有不少正正经经的男人，孩子明明不是他的，平白无故却顶上了 老子的名号。老爷要是真收养下这个孩子，人家更会往这上头想了。何况 孩子本应该由教区负责，您又何必去收养呢？至于我，倘若他是个正经人 家的，那当然另说一一但是这种下贱货我不把他当人看待，连碰也不愿碰 一下。呸，瞧这一身臭味，连一丁点儿基督教徒的气味也没有。我斗胆向 您建议，最好把他装在一只篮子里，摆到教堂执事的门口去。今儿夜里天 气挺好，只不过刮点子风，下着点子雨。要是把他裹得严严实实的，放到 暖暖和和的篮子里，明天早晨给人发现的时候，八成他还能活着。万一他 活不到那时刻，咱们也总算尽到了责任，给了它应有的照顾。这种东西与 其让他长大了去学他娘的样儿，倒还不如乘他还清白无辜的时候让他死掉 的好。横竖他也不会有多大出息的。”
威尔根斯大娘这番话有些地方不大中听，要是奥尔华绥先生曾留意听 她讲话，也许会气恼的。可是这时候他正把一个手指头伸到娃娃的手心 里，娃娃用小手紧紧捏着，仿佛在向他哀呼求救。纵使德波拉大娘的舌头
再灵巧十倍，也抵不过这只小手恳求的力量。奥尔华绥先生立刻斩钉截铁 地吩咐德波拉大娘把娃娃抱到她自己的床上去，另外又叫一个女仆乘孩子 没醒，先替他准备下奶糊一类东西。他还嘱咐明天早晨去给孩子置办下应 有的衣裳，并且等他一醒就把他抱过来。
威尔根斯大娘是那么明辨是非，对东家的意旨又是那么懂得尊重一一 因而她才十分受东家的器重一一终于摒除自己的那些顾忌，遵照奥尔华绥 先生断然的吩咐，把娃娃抱了起来，丝毫也没有再表示出因为他是个私生 子而产生的厌恶。她口口声声喊他作惹人疼的小宝贝，把他抱回自己房里 去了。
于是，奥尔华绥先生酣然入睡了。只有当一颗急公好义的心得到充分 满足的时候，一个人才能睡得像他那么香。由于这样一种享受可能胜过一 顿丰盛的筵席，我甚愿费点笔墨向读者介绍一番这种睡眠，但我只知道换 个地方对改善胃口十分有益，我却不知道该到哪儿去才能增进善行欲。
第四章
一段描写使读者几乎跌断脖子；他如何脱离险境;白丽洁■奥尔华 绥姐如何屈尊迁就
在哥特式⑵建筑中，再没有比奥尔华绥先生的住宅更加壮丽的了。它有 一种宏伟的气派，使人望之肃然起敬，很可以与最上乘的希腊式建筑媲 美。它的外表富丽堂皇，里面舒适宽敞。
这所住宅位于一座小山的东南坡上。东北方，一片长达半哩的老橡树 林沿着山势伸展，刚好形成住宅的屏障。房子靠近山脚，位置倒也高得足 以俯瞰山谷里一片极其动人的风光。
丛林环抱中，有一片美丽的草坪，一直斜铺到房子跟前。草坪高坡 处，一股汹涌的泉水从枞树遮掩下的岩石里喷出，形成一道长达三十叭左 右、经年不息的瀑布。它并非阶梯井然，顺序而下，而是从高高低低、薛 苔斑驳的碎岩散石上翻滚下来。冲到岩石脚下，它就奔入卵石累累的涧 溪，一路上低跃浅踪，迂回注入山麓下的一个小湖。湖位于住宅之南，约 四分之一哩外的一片美丽平原的中央，从住宅向阳的每个房间里都可以眺 望到。平原上牧放着羊群，点缀着一簇簇的榆树和山毛榉。湖里流出一道 小河穿过形形色色的草地和丛林，蜿蜒曲折好几哩，然后倾注于海。辽阔 的港湾外是一座孤岛，这一面的景色到此为止。
山谷右边也是一片平原，面积较小，几座村落点缀其中。平原尽头， 在古老教堂的废墟上，可以望到爬满常春藤的一座钟楼，以及那教堂残存 的部分内墙。
左首是一座秀丽宜人的花园，依着崎岖的山势构成，其丘陵、草地、 丛林、流水，无不曲尽变幻之美，安排得极为幽雅悦目。但这一切多是出 于大自然的匠心，非人力所缔造。再过去，田畴渐次隆起，形成荒山野 岭，峰巅高耸入云。
眼下正是五月中旬，晨光异常静谧。这时候，奥尔华绥先生踱到阳台 上。晨曦把我们前边描绘过的那片妩媚景物，徐徐在他眼前展开。太阳先 射出万道霞光，使之登临蔚蓝的天空，作为它那堂皇威仪的前驱，然后才 带着遍体金光雍容大方地冉冉升起。而在人间，只有奥尔华绥先生这位仁 慈为怀的人，才能跟太阳比绚烂，争光辉。这时际，他正默想着怎样上体 天意，对造物主的子民，行最大的善事。
读者啊，请脚下当心。我一时疏忽，竟贸然将您领到像奥尔华绥先生 这样一座高峰上来，至于如何把您再引下去而不至于跌断脖子，我就不得 而知了。不管怎样，咱们大着胆子向下滑吧，白丽洁小姐正在打铃招呼奥 尔华绥先生去用早饭哩。我也得在场，如果您高兴陪我走一遭的话，我是 十分欢迎的。
兄妹二人互相问过好，斟上了茶。奥尔华绥先生吩咐把威尔根斯大娘 唤来，同时告诉他妹妹说，有一件礼物要送给她。白丽洁小姐道了谢，想 来她必定以为是一件袍子或什么装饰品。奥尔华绥先生确乎时常送给她这 类东西，而她为了让哥哥欢喜，也常花费不少工夫去打扮自己。我所以 说"为了让哥哥欢喜"，因为白丽洁小姐对于装束打扮，以及对好打扮的女 人，一向是深恶痛绝的。
倘若她是这样预料的，那么当威尔根斯大娘遵照东家的吩咐把娃娃抱 来时，她该有多么失望啊！我们晓得，极度的惊愕往往使人沉默无言，白 丽洁小姐此时正是这般光景。后来她哥哥打破寂静，把这件事情原原本本 说给她听了。这段经过读者早已知悉，此处就不再重述。
对于高贵妇女称作"贞操”的这种东西，白丽洁小姐向来表示极其重 视，她本人平时操守又十分谨严。谁都会想到（更不用说是威尔根斯大娘 了），她对这件事必然会大加责难，也许会认为孩子是个可怕的怪物，主 张立刻丢出门去。可是恰恰相反，她对这件事倒采取了较宽厚的态度，对 那个孤苦伶仃的小家伙表示了一定的同情，并且满口夸奖她哥哥的这番义 举。
善人奥尔华绥讲完经过之后，曾立刻就表示一定要把那孩子收养下 来，当作亲生儿女一样看待，从而读者也许会把白丽洁小姐适才的态度理 解为对她哥哥的迁就。老实说，她平时对哥哥总是百依百顺，难得违背他 一下。诚然，她有时也有个三言两语的，说什么男人是任性的，总好固执 己见；又说巴不得她自己有一份财产就好了等等，不过说这类话时她总是 声音放得很小，充其量只不过嘟嚷几句而已。
但是白丽洁小姐在娃娃身上所克制住的，却大大发泄在他那个可怜 的、不知名姓的妈妈身上了，骂她是个不要脸的淫妇，胡作非为的女痞 子，不知廉耻的婊子，坏透了的荡妇，下流的浪货……总之，举凡正经女 人咒骂那些丢尽女性颜面的贱东西时所惯于使用的叫法，她全使用上了。
这时，他们就开始商量怎样追查出这娃娃的妈妈来。先把本宅女仆的 品行逐一审查了一番。威尔根斯大娘认为她们全没有嫌疑，理由极其明 显：她们全是威尔根斯大娘一手物色来的，而重新再去找这么一伙丑八怪 也着实不大容易。
下一步该来审查本教区的居民了。这件事就交给威尔根斯大娘来办 理，由她想方设法去调查出来，下午回来报告。
事情这么安排停当，奥尔华绥先生把孩子交给他妹妹看顾，像往常一 样回到书房去了。白丽洁小姐也就照她哥哥所希望的，把这件事承担下 来。
第五章
几件寻常事，以及对它们一些颇不寻常的看法
奥尔华绥先生走后，德波拉大娘站在那里不吭声，先听听白丽洁小姐 的口风。这位女管事的老练稳重，对小姐在她哥哥面前所说的话决不贸然 信以为真。她不止一次留意到：小姐当着她哥哥的面与背着她哥哥所发表 的意见，往往大相径庭。好在白丽洁小姐并没让她纳闷多久。这位好心肠 的姑娘把睡在德波拉大娘膝上的娃娃端详了一阵，忍不住狠狠吻了一下， 夸奖孩子长得俊，天真可爱，说她喜欢极了。德波拉大娘一看小姐这般光 景，自己也就赶忙把孩子搂住，连连亲吻。那一瞬间的狂热情景，宛如一 位四+五岁的淑女遇上了一位生龙活虎的年轻新郎。她尖声细气地嚷 着："哎哟，我的小心肝，可爱的小宝贝！我敢发誓，天底下再没有比他长 得更俊的了。”
她正这么赞不绝口，倒还是白丽洁小姐把话给打断了。她着手办起哥 哥交代给她的事，吩咐替孩子备下一切应用的物件，并且把宅里一个十分 舒适的房间指定为婴儿室。她的安排是那么慷慨大方，即使孩子是她亲生 的，也不过如此。我担心那些重视风纪道德的读者，说不定会怪她过分抬 举了一个出身下贱的婴儿，因为对这种孩子发慈悲是违背教义，为法律所 禁止的。因此，还应该交代一下白丽洁小姐最后说过的一段话：既然她哥 哥一阵心血来潮，收养下这个小崽子，那自然就得把他当少爷看待，好生 照应。至于她自己，却不能不认为这件事无异于助长伤风败俗的行为。可 是她深深懂得男人那股执拗性子，也就不硬去反对这种荒唐想法了。
前文中已经提到过，每逢白丽洁小姐勉强顺从了她哥哥的什么心意， 她总是带着这种论调的。最能跟她这种柔顺美德相得益彰的，莫如她一方 面说她认为哥哥这些想法荒谬，有悖常情，而另一方面却仍然屈意顺从。 无言的服从意味着本人的意志并没受到什么压力，因而实行起来也较为容 易，毫不感觉痛苦。可是当我们的妻子、儿女或亲戚朋友满口怨言，带着 一脸的厌恶和不满，勉勉强强去办一件我们希望他们办的事的时候，他们 所忍受的明显的困苦，必然也就越发加深了我们的感激。
这是一点深刻的体会。我料想读者中间能有此体会的为数极少，觉得 理应帮一下忙。不过，在本书的进程中，我是轻易不肯帮这种忙的。说实
在的，只有当我们这些作家所特有的灵感能够帮助读者得出这点体会时, 我才肯助一臂之力呢。

第六章
用个比喻介绍德波拉大娘到教区去的情况;关于珍妮•琼斯的一段 简短叙述，顺便谈谈年轻妇女钻研学问时可能遇到的艰难和挫折
德波拉大娘遵照东家的吩咐，把娃娃安置停当之后，就准备去访查那 些可能隐匿着那娃娃的妈妈的人家。
正像一只巨鸟鹞鹰在高空盘旋的时候，下面那些多情的鸽子和其他一 些无害的小鸟仰首望到它，都立刻惊叫起来，颤抖着各自奔向藏身之所； 这只猛鸟凌空鼓着双翼，耀武扬威地翱翔着，准备随时攫取下方的羽族
同样，当德波拉大娘即将莅临的消息一传到街上，所有居民也都战战 兢兢地赶紧奔回家中，每个妇女都唯恐她会光顾到自己头上。德波拉大娘 大摇大摆地跨过田野，昂起脑袋，满脸挂着高人一等的倨傲，并且认为一 定有办法把案子查个水落石出。
贤明的读者看了上面这个比喻，可不要以为这些可怜的居民对威尔根 斯大娘的来意，事先早有所闻。不过，这个比喻的妙处可能要湮没几百 年，才会有评论家替本书作注，因此，我想不如在这里为读者点破。
我打算表明的是：正如吞噬小鸟是鹞鹰的天性，侮辱、欺凌小人物也 是威尔根斯大娘这种人的天性。伺候主子的时候，她们奴颜婢膝，百依百 顺，然后就这么来找补。奴才和拍马逢迎者向比他们高的人交什么税，就 一定要从比他们低的人身上照样再捞回来。这也是合情合理的。
每逢德波拉大娘在白丽洁小姐跟前作出格外卑躬屈节的表现，心里自 然感到不大痛快。通常她总是来光顾这些人，拿他们发泄一通，消消怒 气，排遣一下心中的郁闷。因此，她不是一位受欢迎的客人一一说老实 话，这一带没人对她不是又怕又恨的。
德波拉大娘一到，立刻就去拜访一位上了些年纪的妇女。不论在相貌 还是年龄上，她都跟德波拉大娘相仿佛，凭着这份福气，她一向比别人更 受德波拉大娘的赏识。德波拉大娘向她讲了所发生的事情，以及她早晨跑 来的用意。随后，她们俩就开始仔细研究那一带年轻姑娘们素日的品行， 嫌疑最重的是个叫珍妮-琼斯的姑娘，她们俩都认为事情多半是她干出来 的。
不论是五官还是身段，这位珍妮•琼斯生得都够不上漂亮。但是她在姿 容上的缺陷，造物却用一份超乎寻常的智力多少替她弥补上了一一对那些 年龄完全成熟、对事物有了判断的妇女来说，智力毋宁是更加可贵的。珍 妮仗着自己的勤勉好学，又大大发展了这种天资。她在一位塾师家里当过 几年女仆。塾师看出这姑娘聪颖过人，求知心切，发现她一得空总捧起学 生的课本来读；于是就好心地（或者说糊涂地，随读者怎么说吧）教她学 通了拉丁文，学问或许不在大部分上流社会的子弟之下。然而，跟大多数 其他不同寻常的优点一样，她这个长处也给她带来某些小小的不方便。这 么多才多艺的一位姑娘，当然不乐意跟那些身份虽与她相当、然而所受的 教育却远不如她的姑娘们交往，这原是不足为奇的。珍妮高出大家一头， 从而在举止言谈上也势必同旁的姑娘们两样，这样，在别的姑娘们当中引 起一些嫉妒和反感更是很自然的事。所以她从塾师那里辞工回来后，街坊 四邻也许一直就对她怀恨在心。
这种嫉妒心情起初还只是暗自埋在大家心里，到了一个礼拜天，才终 于公开表露出来。这一天，可怜的珍妮居然穿上一件新绸衫，戴上一顶镶 花边的帽子，还配搭上相称的装饰品，公然在大街上露面了。这可使得人 人都大吃一惊，附近这一带的姑娘没一个不恼火的。
那股先前只是闷在她们心里的妒火，这时全部爆发出来了。珍妮由于 自己有了学问，自尊心加强了，就要别人敬重她。可是偏偏哪个邻居也没 那么好心来满足她这种愿望。如今，她这身打扮给她带来的不是敬重和仰 慕，而是憎恶和诟骂。整个教区都明说她这些穿戴一定来路不明。做父母 的不但不巴望自家的女儿也穿得这么阔气，还说，谢天谢地，幸亏自己的 姑娘没有这些东西。
也许正是由于这桩事，威尔根斯大娘一到，那位好女人立刻就把这个 可怜的姑娘的名字提出来。另外还有个情况也进一步加深了威尔根斯大娘 的怀疑：珍妮近来时常到奥尔华绥先生家里走动。白丽洁小姐得过一场重 病，那回就是珍妮去看护的。一连好几夜，她通宵达旦地陪着小姐。此 外，就在奥尔华绥先生回来的前一天，威尔根斯大娘还亲眼看到她在那 里。不过，最初这位精明人并没有因此而怀疑她。正像她自己说的，她一 向认为珍妮是个稳重的姑娘（尽管她不怎么清楚珍妮的根底）。她怀疑的 倒是那些水性杨花的浪荡女人，她们神气+足，总觉得自己长得多么标 致。
这时，德波拉大娘要珍妮亲自来见她，姑娘马上就来了。德波拉大娘 立刻摆出一副法官的庄重面孔，而且比法官来得还要严峻一些。她劈头就 骂了一句："你这不要脸的婊子！ "口气不像对一个被告起诉，倒更像是对 一个犯人宣判。
虽然德波拉大娘根据以上种种情况，已经足以判断事情是珍妮干的 了，不过要奥尔华绥先生来定案，那也许还需要些更确凿的证据。然而珍 妮并没让那些控告她的人费神，她一口全招认下来了。
珍妮在招认时，言词之间已经颇有些悔过之意，但是德波拉大娘并没 因此而软下心肠来。这时，她用更加侮辱的字眼，再一次宣布珍妮的罪 状。对于越聚越多的看热闹的人来说，珍妮的招认也没起好作用。不少人 嚷着："我们早就料到你那件绸衫会带来什么结果！"也有人挖苦她的学 问。在场的妇女个个都想法表示了自己对可怜的珍妮的唾弃。除了一个女 人说的恶毒的话之外，这一切珍妮都耐着性子容忍下来了。那女人翘起下 巴，讥消珍妮的相貌说："肯把绸衫送给这种丑八怪，那个男人真可算是饥 不择食哩！"珍妮听了，狠狠地回敬了她几句。有识之士看到方才别人攻击 珍妮的贞操时，她一直都那么镇定地忍受下来了，一定会为她这些话感到 惊讶。不过忍耐这种美德，一旦用过了头，也容易使人腻烦。珍妮大概就 是到了忍无可忍的地步。
德波拉大娘这遭访查的结果，远远超出她原来的希望。她凯旋归来， 就在指定的时刻向奥尔华绥先生原原本本地回报了。她这番话使奥尔华绥 先生大吃一惊。他曾听人提起这位姑娘的才能学识很不寻常，本打算把她 配给邻村的一位副牧师，并且赠她一小笔年金当陪嫁。此时，他感到的难 过至少不亚于德波拉大娘表现出的快意，而在许多读者看来，他这么难过 似乎更要合情合理得多。
白丽洁小姐在胸前画了个十字，说："至于我自己，从今以后再也不会 对任何女人抱好感了。"因为在这以前，珍妮曾受到过她的恩宠。
奥尔华绥先生派这位稳重的女管事再跑一趟，把那倒霉的犯人带到他 跟前来；不过不是为了把她送到感化院去（像某些人所盼望和人人所估计 的），而是为了责备她几句，当面对她进行一番有益的劝诫。凡喜欢读这 种教训文字的，请阅下面一章。
第七章
这一章写的全是严肃的事，读者自始至终一次也笑不出来，除非或 许笑作者本人
珍妮来到以后，奥尔华绥先生就把她领到书房去，对她说了下面这番 话："孩子，我是这里的保安官，你做下了这样的事，你晓得我是有权严办 你的。大概你更有理由担心我会这么做，因为也可以说你是把你犯的罪过 赖在我身上了。
"可是也许正由于这个，我才决定对你宽厚些，因为做保安官的在处理 事务的时候，丝毫也不应该受到私人冤仇的影响。我不但不认为你把娃娃 放到我家就更加重了你的罪名，反而还要站在有利于你的方面来看待这件 事，认为你这么做是出于对孩子的天伦之爱。你大概希望这样一来，孩子 就能得到较好的照顾，比靠你自己的力量来抚养，或交给他那坏老子强一 些。倘若你像某些毫无心肝的母亲那样，不但丧失了贞操，好像连自己的 天性也丧失了，竟然把这个小可怜儿一丢了事，那我倒会十分震怒的。我 要责备你的，是你另一方面的罪过一一我指的是你听任自己的贞操被糟 蹋。不管那些荒淫无耻的家伙怎样把这种事等闲看待，这却是一桩严重的 罪行，后果十分可怕。
"每个基督教徒都十分清楚这种罪行的严重性质，因为它公然违背了我 们的教规也，和我主所明确吩咐的旨意。
"这种罪行后果的可怕，也是不难证明的。还有什么比违背天旨，触怒 神明更可怕的呢？何况已经明确宣布过，对你所犯的这种罪行，要处以最 严厉的惩罚！
"这些道理都十分清楚（尽管我担心大家并不怎么重视），提醒你一 下，引起你的注意也尽够了。不论人们怎样善忘，也用不着重新告诉他 们。我是想叫你听了翻然悔改，而不是要把你赶到绝路上去。
"这种罪过还会给你带来一些别的后果，虽然没有前边说的那么骇人， 那么充满了恐怖，但是倘若你们妇女仔细考虑一下，至少也全都不敢去犯 这种罪过了。
"犯了这种罪过，你就会声名狼藉，像古时候的麻风病人一样，被人从 社会上一一起码也要从恶棍无赖以外的人当中赶出去，因为除了这号人， 谁也不愿意跟你往来。
"你就是有财产，这样一来也就无从享受了 ；要是没有的话，也休想再 得到什么一一你几乎无法谋生，因为正经人家是不会让你进门的。这样， 衣食无着，往往就会把你逼到耻辱和贫困的境地。最后，肉体和灵魂必然 会同归于尽。
"不管是什么样的欢乐，怎能补偿这种灾难呢？不管是用什么样娓娓动 听的话或蒙蔽手段来诱惑，又怎能驱使你去上这样明显的当呢？不管是什 么样的肉欲，怎能压倒你的理性，或者把它完全麻痹住，使你面临这种必 然会带来严厉惩罚的罪过，而不知恐惧地逃避呢？
"要是一个女人堕落到跟禽兽一般，为了满足与最下贱的畜生所共有的 那种肉欲，就把天性里一切崇高、伟大的品质，一切神圣的东西都牺牲 掉，她该是多么卑鄙可耻！这样的女人已经完全失去了尊严和应有的自豪 感，而没有这些，我们就配不上万物之灵这个称号。当然，没有女人可以 把'受爱情所驱使'当作借口。那等于承认自己不过是个任凭男人玩弄的工具 而已。不管人们怎样歪曲、贬低爱情的意义，它总是值得赞美、因而也是 富有理性的感情。除非双方彼此倾心，它是炽热不起来的。尽管《圣经》 吩咐我们要爱我们的仇敌以，但那指的并不是我们必须待他们以对朋友的发 自内心的挚爱，更不用说是为他们牺牲我们的生命以及我们理应看得比生 命还要宝贵的东西一一清白。对于一个仅仅为了换取自己无聊、可鄙的片 刻之欢，竟然害一个女人作出那么惨重的牺牲，为她造成前边谈到的那么 多灾难的男人，头脑清醒的妇女除了把他当作仇敌看待，还能当作什么 呢？这种耻辱和它带来的一切可怕的后果，照例都只会落到女人头上。爱 情只能促使人为对方谋求幸福，哪里会要坑害一个女人，把她拖进一个会 使她遭受巨大损失的勾当中去呢？倘若这样的坏蛋居然还厚颜无耻地对女 人装出一片真心实意，难道她还不应该把他看作仇敌一一并且是一个最凶 恶的仇敌吗？他虚情假意，阴险狡猾，背信弃义；表面上装作朋友，骨子 里却不但要玷污女人的身子，同时也要败坏她的理智。”
听到这里，珍妮表示十分不安。奥尔华绥喘了口气，又接着说下 去："孩子，我这么同你谈，并不是要拿已成过去而且也无可挽回的事来辱 骂你一通，而是要忠告你，今后应更加谨慎和坚强。尽管这回你犯下了个 可怕的过失，我仍然认为你是个有见识的姑娘。既然你招认得这么真挚坦 率，我多少还是相信你会真诚悔过的，不然的话，我就不会来费这番事 了。倘若我这些估计都是实情，那么我愿意负责让你悄悄离开这个丢脸的
所在，把你送到一个陌生的地方去；那里，人们不晓得你这段经过，你也 就可以免除我刚才说的在人世应受的惩罚了。我还希望由于你的悔改，来 世你也不会受到那里对这种罪行订下的更加严厉的处分。从今以后，做个 好姑娘吧，不要让贫困驱使你走上邪路。孩子，相信我的话，就是在尘世 间，过一辈子清白、规矩日子，也比荒淫、放荡要快乐得多。
"至于这个孩子，你用不着担心。我给他安排下的一切会大大超出你的 希望。现在只剩下一件事：告诉我引诱你的那个坏人是谁，因为我对他的 气愤要比你为此所感到的要大得多。”
珍妮这时抬起头来，带着腼腆的神情，用不亢不卑的声调说道：
"任何人和您相识而不爱慕您的善良，只能证明那人不是完全没有头 脑，就是他自己心里根本缺乏这种善良。您今番对我的这份盛情，如果我 没有深刻体会，那我可就太忘恩负义了。关于我过去这段伤心事，我晓得 您会体谅我，不叫我去重复一遍，免得我羞愧难当。凭今后的行为来说明 我的感受，要比当前任何表白都强得多。先生，请容我向您保证，您的劝 告比您最后慨然做的诺言更加使我感激，因为正如您所说的，这表明您相 信我是有见识的……"说到这里，她簌簌地淌下泪来。歇了一晌，她又接着 说："真的，您的恩德使我感动得无话可说。我一定竭尽一切力量，使自己 不辜负您的褒奖。要是我真有您所说的那份见识，我就不会把您这番劝告 当作耳旁风。我衷心感谢您将要施给我那孤苦伶仃的孩子的一切恩惠。他 是没有罪的。我希望他将来长大了，永不忘记您的大恩大德。可是我现在 得跪下来哀求您，别硬要我说出这孩子的父亲是谁。我诚恳地向您保证， 终有一天您会晓得的。但是我已经凭人格庄严地许过诺言，并且发过最神 圣的誓，我目前不便透露他的姓名。我深深知道您的为人，您决不情愿我 言而无信，或违背教义的。”
只要稍稍提到这类圣洁字眼，就足以使奥尔华绥先生不再追问下去 了。他回答之前，先踌躇了一阵，然后责备珍妮不该对一个坏人许下诺 言；可是既然已经许下了，他也决不逼她破约。他说，他所以问起，并不 是徒然出于好奇，而是为了好惩罚那家伙；至少，可以避免把恩惠错赏给 一个不配享受的人。
关于这一层，珍妮十分郑重地向他担保说，那个人根本不在他左近， 他既不归奥尔华绥先生所管辖，也受不到他的垂顾。
珍妮这种坦率态度深深赢得了这位可敬的人的信任。奥尔华绥先生对 她所说的一切深信不疑。这姑娘既然不屑于用撒谎来替自己开脱，事到如 今，她宁可冒着更加惹怒奥尔华绥的危险，也不肯出卖旁人，丧失自己的 人格和信义，就更不必担心她会对他撒谎了。
于是，奥尔华绥先生答应不久就把她送到一个听不到她自己招来的恶 言恶语的地方。最后，他又教训了珍妮几句，劝她痛改前非。他说："孩 子，你还得重新得到另外一位0的欢心。对你来说，他赐的恩惠要比我的重 要多了。"说完，就放她回去了。
第八章
白丽洁小姐和德波拉大娘之间的一段谈话;比起上一章来，趣味多 而教训少
正如我们上面所看到的，奥尔华绥先生领着珍妮到书房里去的时候， 白丽洁小姐和那位可敬的管家婆就走进隔壁房间，择定了一个位置，从锁 孔眼里把奥尔华绥先生那一番谆谆教诲，珍妮的应对，以及前一章里描绘 的一切，句句都偷听了去。
白丽洁小姐确乎非常熟悉她哥哥书房门上的这个孔眼，并且经常使用 它，正像古时候提斯柏使用她墙上的那个有名的窟窿一样。珥这孔眼有种种 用处。借此，白丽洁小姐时常可以晓得她哥哥想做些什么，这样，也省得 他当面再说一遍了。靠这个办法来探听消息，诚然也有不方便的地方，难 怪有时候她会像莎士比亚剧中的提斯柏那样嚷着："啊，你这堵可恶的、可 恶的墙！ 奥尔华绥先生既然是当地的保安官，那么在审讯私生子这类案 件的时候，难免有些话语会玷污了处女的纯洁耳朵一一尤其像白丽洁小姐 这样年近四十的处女。不过，在这种情况下，她也有一种方便的地方：那 就是可以不让男人看到她脸红，而De non apparentibus，et non existentibus eadem est ration 翻译出来就是：一个女人倘若没有 人瞅见她脸红，那她的脸就没红。
在奥尔华绥先生和那姑娘谈话的当儿，这两位可敬的女人一声也没 响。可是等谈话结束后，奥尔华绥先生刚一走开，德波拉大娘就禁不住抱 怨起东家太宽大了。她特别不赞成老爷容许姑娘把孩子的爸爸隐瞒起来。 她赌咒说，不等太阳落山，非叫她吐露出来不可。
听了这话，白丽洁小姐不由得破颜而笑了一一这在她是极为罕见的。 读者莫以为她曾嫣然一笑，像荷马称维纳斯也为爱笑的女神时叫您摹想的那 种浪笑；也不是赛拉芬也夫人从剧院包厢里发出来的那种粲然一笑（倘或维 纳斯也能笑得那么迷人，她会宁愿谪为凡人的）。不，白丽洁小姐的这一 笑倒不如说宛似威风凛凛的蒂色芬也（或是她姐妹中间的一位）带有酒窝的 面庞上泛起的那种笑容。
白丽洁小姐脸上就带着这样一种微笑，声调温柔得像和煦的+—月里 波利亚斯也刮起的晚风，轻轻责备德波拉大娘不该这么好奇。这种恶习在她 身上似乎染得太深了，小姐不能不深恶痛绝地对之大加谴责，最后她还补
充说："尽管她自己毛病很多，可是谢天谢地，连最恨她的人也不能责怪她 好窥探旁人的私事。”
跟着，她夸奖珍妮做事有骨气，守信义。她说她只能赞同她哥哥的看 法，认为那姑娘招认得很坦率，她对情人又忠实到底，这都是值得称许 的。还说，她一向认为珍妮是个很好的姑娘，毫无疑问她是上了什么恶棍 的当，那个家伙应该受到比她严厉得多的责备。想必他曾许下跟她结婚或 使用了别的蒙哄手段，才把她骗了。
白丽洁小姐的这种态度，可叫德波拉大娘大吃一惊。这位素有教养的 女人不论对东家还是小姐，不先探准口风是难得开口的，她总是迎合主子 的心意。她本想，这回总该是万无一失了吧。贤明的读者谅必也不会怪她 在看风使舵上有欠功夫，看看她一发觉航线不对，马上就会掉转船头的那 种灵活机警，还会对她无限佩服呢。
"小姐，确实是这样，"这位精明强干、具有真正大政治家风度的女人 说道，"我必须承认，我跟您一样不得不佩服这姑娘的骨气。要是像小姐您 说的，这可怜虫是上了什么坏人的当，那可真值得人同情。而且正如您说 的：看起来这姑娘一向都很规矩老实，朴朴素素，从来不像左近那些轻佻 女人那样自以为脸蛋子长得漂亮。”
"德波拉，你说得完全对，"白丽洁小姐说，"咱们教区里贱女人可真不 少。这姑娘要是跟她们一路货，我哥哥对她这么宽大，那我怎么也不会答 应。有一天我瞅见两个庄稼汉的闺女上教堂，光着个脖子，可把我吓坏 啦！要是那些浪货卖弄风骚招引男人，那她们受什么罪也活该。我讨厌这 类货！对她们来说，脸上密密匝匝长满了麻子也许倒好得多。可是我从来 也没瞅见可怜的珍妮有过这类轻佻的举止。准是什么坏蛋诡计多端，害她 上了当，甚至还许是强奸了她呢。我打心坎上同情她。”
对这些看法，德波拉大娘一概表示赞同。谈话煞尾时，她们把天下的 美人都咒骂了一番，而对所有性情老实、姿色平凡，受坏人蒙骗的姑娘们 寄以无限同情。
第九章
一些令读者惊讶的事情
珍妮回到家里，对奥尔华绥先生这番接见感到十分满意，就竭力宣扬 奥尔华绥先生对她如何如何宽厚，一方面也许是为了赚回点面子，另外她 也还有个更世故的用意：想借此缓和一下街坊们的情绪，省得她们老喋喋 不休。
倘使她确有后一个用意，这似乎也是合乎情理的。可是事情并不如她 所希望的。珍妮给传去之后，大家都认为她准会被关进教养所。有些年轻 妇女还嚷着："那地方对她就算不错啦！"一面说，一面摹想着珍妮穿了绸 衫捶麻丝的情景，觉得十分开心。但另外也有不少人开始对她的处境感到可 怜起来。可是等大家一听到奥尔华绥先生对这件事的处理经过，情势马上 又对她不利了。甲说："我敢保险这位小姐交上好运啦。"乙喊道："瞧，受 宠的人多么方便！"丙说："这还不都亏了她那一肚子的学问！"大家七嘴八 舌地骂着，个个都怪保安官偏袒了珍妮。
读者诸君考虑到奥尔华绥先生掌握的权力和他为人的慈祥后，一定会 觉得这些人的行为未免显得太不识时务，太没良心了。奥尔华绥先生手里 有权，可是他从来不加使用；而那份仁厚之心，他倒总是尽量发挥，以致 惹得四邻街坊们都很不高兴。凡是伟大人物莫不熟知这个奥秘：施一次恩 惠未必能交上一个朋友，然而却准能招来一群冤家。
不论如何，没过多久珍妮就仰仗奥尔华绥先生的好心照顾，离开了这 里，再也听不到他们的指责了。人们无法再把恶毒的谩骂发泄在珍妮身 上，只好另寻目标。流言蜚语竟然落到奥尔华绥先生身上来了。很快就传 出谣言，说他本人就是那个弃儿的父亲。
这种假设是+分符合大家对奥尔华绥先生关于此事所持态度的意见 的，因而一传开来大家马上就一致同意。以前他们吵吵奥尔华绥先生不该 那么宽大，这一回却又攻击他对那可怜的姑娘太残酷无情了。有些十分庄 重的正经女人还大声疾呼，反对男人搞出孩子来，然后又丢了不认。甚至 还有一种人在珍妮走后，含沙射影地说，那姑娘准是给拐走了，背后必然 有着难以言传的恶毒阴谋，还不断暗示应请法院彻底调查一下这件事；藏 匿姑娘的，必须叫他交出来。
如果碰上一个素日品行有些站不住脚的，这种诽谤多半会引起极坏的 后果，最起码也会为本人招来一些麻烦。但这却难不住奥尔华绥先生。他 听了这些流言，睬都不睬。这只不过为左近四邻提供些插科打诨的材料而 已。
既然我们无法猜测读者是什么气质的人，而珍妮一时又还不会在书中 出现，作者理应早些告诉大家：奥尔华绥先生过去对珍妮从没有怀过歹 意，看来今后也不会怀什么歹意。老实说，如果他有什么失策的话，那就 在于他坚持恩威并施，不肯迎合群盲也的善良心愿。他们本来希望他把可怜 的珍妮关进教养所，让她受到丢人的管教，使她身败名裂，这样他们好对 她寄予同情，奥尔华绥先生却不肯把可怜的珍妮变成群盲怜恤的对象。
倘若照他们这种想法做去，珍妮改过自新的道路也就化为乌有了。纵 然她自己满心想改邪归正，路子也必全给堵死。奥尔华绥先生决不去满足 这种愿望。反之，他采用了唯一能鼓励姑娘走上正路的办法。我认为事实 确是这样：多少初次失足的妇女，只因没得到改过的机会，竟然自暴自 弃，以致沉沦到罪恶深渊里去，永不能自拔。只要失足的人仍然与旧日相 识的人处在一起，这种情势就在所难免。因此，在珍妮尝过丧失体面的滋 味之后，奥尔华绥先生把她迁到另外一个地方，叫她享受一下做体面人的 愉快，这办法是十分明智的。
因此，不管珍妮去哪里，我们都祝她一路平安。眼下，咱们暂且同她 （以及她遗弃的那个孩子）告别，因为还有重要得多的事要告诉读者。
第十章
奥尔华绥先生慷慨好客;简单描写一下他所招待的两兄弟一一一个 医生和一个大尉的性格
不论是奥尔华绥先生的家宅，还是他的心怀，对任何人都从不关门； 尤其对那些值得尊敬的人更是如此。只要你这人值得款待就一定请你吃一 顿一一老实说，走遍全英国，这样做的也只有他一家。
在客人中，有才能、有学问的格外受他垂青，这方面他很有些眼光。 尽管他自己没有机会受到高深的教育，但是他天分很高，年事稍长又刻苦 钻研过，而且由于经常和知名学者交往，也获得许多教益，因此，对好多 方面的学问他都有精湛的见解。
在我们这个时代，这方面的才能是不时兴的，所获报酬自然也十分菲 薄。难怪有才学的人都急于投奔到这个肯定会殷勤接待他们的地方来。鬼一 切豪华的享受他们几乎都享受到了，那就好像是他们自己的家当一样。有 些慷慨好客的人也为才子、学者备下珍馐美酒和下榻的地方，他们所要求 于客人的则是替他们消闲解闷，出谋画策，对他们恭维奉承，供他们驱 使。总之，这些客人应当排在仆役之列，不过是不穿东家的号衣，不领工 钱罢了。奥尔华绥先生却不是这样。
相反，住在他府上的客人完全可以自由支配自己的时间。只要不越出 法律、道德和宗教许可的范围，他可以尽情地吃喝。而如果由于健康关 系，或因本人想少喝点酒，乃至要干脆把酒戒掉，那么只要他高兴，随便 什么时候他都可以不去用膳或者中途退席，不必担心会有人来挽留他一一 这种表示倘若来自地位高于我们的人，往往就会带有强烈的命令意味。但 是在奥尔华绥先生家里，谁也不会受到这种无礼。不仅对那些因为有着与 主人同样多的财富，其光顾往往被看作赏面子的阔人是如此，甚至对那些 家境贫寒、能够有这么个寄食的地方感到很便当的人也是如此；后者正因 为迫切需要当大人物的座上宾，也就不那么受欢迎了。
在后一类客人中间，有一位布利非大夫。他本来蛮有才能，可惜没有 发展的机会，因为他父亲固执，偏要培养他去从事一门他不喜欢的职业。 为了顺从父亲执拗的脾气，他不得不在年轻时候就去学医一一或者声称自 己学了医，因为在所有的书籍当中，唯独医学书是他所不熟悉的。说来也
够倒霉的。别的学问他门内精通，单单他要指着吃饭的这一门却一窍不 通。结果，这位大夫刚交四十,就连饭也混不上了。
这样的人物来到奥尔华绥先生府上，必然受到欢迎。一个人的不幸只 要是出于旁人的卑鄙愚蠢的勾当，而不是遭到不幸的人自己造成的，那么 这种不幸就毫无例外地会在奥尔华绥先生心目中抬高这个人的身价。医生 除了这个消极的优点，还有个"积极”的长处一一他看来十分笃信宗教。至 于他是真心信奉，还是只做做样子给别人看，我不便断言，因为我并没有 一块足以辨别真伪的试金石。
如果说他这种虔诚使奥尔华绥先生满意了，那么白丽洁小姐感到的则 是喜悦。她经常跟医生讨论宗教，对医生这方面的学识十分佩服；而医生 对她的学问也恭维备至，她听了同样感到高兴。她确实读了不少英国神学 书籍，左近一带的副牧师让她难住的颇不乏人。老实说，她的谈吐是那么 纯正，神情是那么庄重，举止又是那么严肃，大可以跟与她同名的那位圣 女四，或罗马历书近上任何一位女人媲美，"圣女"这个称号她是当之无愧 的。
各种共鸣都容易产生爱情，经验更昭示我们，再也没有比宗教上的共 鸣更能在男女之间促成好事的了。医生看出自己赢得了白丽洁小姐的欢 心，不禁懊悔+来年前偶然发生的一桩不幸。就是说，那时他跟一个女人 结了婚，如今，那个女人不仅还健在人间，更糟的是，奥尔华绥先生也晓 得这一点。这可真是个致命的障碍，不然的话，对于跟这位小姐完成一段 美满姻缘，他早已有了八九成的把握。至于暧昧关系，那他是从未动过念 头的。这多半是由于他信教虔诚，更可能是由于他用情之专：因为他的满 腔热情都贯注在只有靠婚姻（而不是靠罪恶的暧昧关系）才能拿到手、或 是有权拿到手的那些财富上。
这件事他琢磨了没多久，就想起他还有个兄弟；老弟倒没有他这种不 幸的缺憾。他相信这位弟弟一定可以马到成功，因为据他看来，小姐正渴 望着早日出嫁，而读者听到这位老弟的种种条件后，也许就不会怪他哥哥 这么把握十足了。
这位先生年约三十五岁，中等身材，体格可以说是挺健壮的。额上有 块疤痕，那并无损于他的俊秀，却足以表明他的骁勇一一他是个退伍军 官。他的牙齿很美，而且只要他愿意，笑起来也能显出和蔼可亲的样子。 虽然他的相貌神情和嗓音都带着一股粗鲁气，可是他随时都可以收敛起
来，显得温柔体贴，好脾气。其实，他并非毫无教养，或完全不懂风趣， 年轻时候，他也曾十分活跃。近年来虽然摆出一副庄重面孔，可是只要他 高兴，什么时候都可以恢复旧日的神态。
跟医生一样，他也受过大学教育。他父亲曾使用前边提过的父权，一 定要他去当牧师。可是没等举行授圣职典礼他父亲就去世了。于是，他就 不在主教的麾下服役，转而接受了国王的任命。
他先在龙骑队里买了个中尉的缺，后来做到大尉。可是他跟上校吵了 架，为自己着想，只好把官职卖掉。从那以后，他一直蛰居乡间，专门研 究《圣经》，颇有些人怀疑他想要加入卫理公会丝］。
这样一位先生，遇上那样一位除了寻个丈夫别无他求的圣洁的小姐， 好事当然不难撮合。不过医生对他这位老弟本来谈不上什么深厚感情，如 今，为了他的缘故，竟然这样辜负奥尔华绥对他的一番盛情，个中道理倒 是颇为费解的。
难道有的人生来专喜作恶，就像有的人被认为性喜行善一样吗？难道 当一个人自己不能去偷盗时，给贼当个帮手也可以得到快感吗？要不就是 尽管一个人一点也不喜爱或尊重他本家的人，但只要他能叫他们发迹，自 己总会得到一种满足吗？一一就实际经验而言，这似乎是可能的。
这些动机中间，有没有一个在医生身上起过作用，我们不愿妄加断 定，但是事实确是如此。他把弟弟叫了来，然后毫不费力地就把他介绍给 奥尔华绥一家，说他是专诚来探望哥哥的，来此只不过小住几日而已。
大尉来了不上一个星期，医生就有理由庆幸自己的眼力不差。大尉确 实不愧为一位恋爱大师，其手段之高明，真与从前的奥维德四不相上下。他 还从他哥哥那里得到不少良策，这些，他自然都尽量使用上了。
第十一章
有关谈情说爱的许多规矩和若干实例;几段关于美貌以及其他一些 更应审慎对待的婚姻诱因的描写
有些聪明男女（我记不得是男是女了）曾经说过：无论什么人，一辈 子注定总要恋爱一次的。就我记忆所及，说这话的人也并没确言是在什么 特定的时期，而白丽洁小姐当前所到达的年龄，依我看来是和任何其他年 龄同样适于恋爱的。诚然，这种事儿发生的年龄通常要比她早得多，不 过，如果过去不曾发生过，到她这般年龄就一定要发生了。而且我还想指 出，这样年纪的爱情比年轻人的要严肃、稳定多了。年轻姑娘们的爱情是 摇摆不定，变幻无常的，而且糊涂得有时候叫人莫名其妙，甚至几乎让人 怀疑她们自己究竟知不知道要干些什么。
可是对于四+来岁的女人，我们没什么捉摸不定的。这些庄重、严 肃、饱经世故的女人，对自己的目的是很清楚的，因而即使最拙笨的男 人，也总能+拿九稳地看穿她们的意向。
白丽洁小姐正是我这些看法的一个例证。她和大尉只不过接触了几 回，就有了爱情。她也并没像个不懂事的毛丫头那样形容憔悴，长吁短 叹，绕着屋子里出外进，不知道自己何以会失去了常态。她相信爱情这股 甜馨的感情不但是无害的，而且还是值得嘉许的，因而她既不害羞，也不 害怕；她只是在感受着，体验着，陶醉着。
说句老实话，这般年纪的女人对男人所怀的富有理性的爱情，与少女 对小伙子的那种天真的、幼稚的爱情，在各方面都大不相同。少女往往把 爱情倾注在外貌上，或寄托在价值不大、为时不久的事物上，诸如粉红的 脸蛋、雪白的小手、黑李子般的眼睛、披垂的鬈发、柔嫩的下巴、匀称的 身材等等；有时候甚至爱上比这些更不值一顾或与情人关系更远的东西， 如身上的穿戴，这些东西并不是造物的赋与，只能归功于裁缝、织花边 的、编假发的，以及制帽子的。姑娘们往往对人对己都不好意思承认自己 在这方面的热情，这倒也情有可原。
白丽洁小姐的爱情却迥然不同。大尉在穿戴方面丝毫不倚重那些专门 为花花公子制作漂亮衣饰的人，在仪表方面他也没什么可以感激造物的。 倘若他在大庭广众之中或客厅里出现，他的尊容和打扮一定会引起在场所 有高贵妇女的轻蔑和讪笑。其实，他的服装倒还齐整，只是粗俗、难看，
而且很不时兴。至于他的仪表，前边我们已特意描绘过了。他那双颊的皮 肤不但不是粉红色的，简直无从辨认它究竟是什么颜色，因为他满脸全是 黑色的络腮胡子，一直长到眼边。他的腰身和四肢搭配得固然匀称，可是 生得又粗又大，力气壮得更像个庄稼汉。他的肩膀宽得出奇，小腿肚比一 个普通轿夫还要肥实。一句话，他通身找不到一点秀气劲儿，而这种秀气 和笨力气恰恰相反，它使上流社会的绅士们显得格外体面。这一方面是由 于他们祖先所遗传下来的高贵血液一一那是用美味的肉汁和名贵的佳酿配 合而成的，另一方面则应归之于他们自幼所受的城市教育。
尽管白丽洁小姐十分讲究雅致，可是大尉的谈吐是如此富于魅力，她 竟完全看不到他外表上的那些缺陷了。她估量跟大尉一起生活，要远比跟 一个外貌比他漂亮得多的小伙子一起生活幸福一一这种估计也许是颇为明 智的。因此，她牺牲了眼福方面的考虑，来换取一种更实惠的满足。
大尉一发觉白丽洁小姐对他有了爱情（在这方面他的眼力格外犀 利），就也马上诚心诚意地向她表示了同样的情意。小姐的姿容也并不比 她这位情郎出色多少。我本想为她画一幅肖像，怎奈一位更高明的画家贺 加斯丝先生早已留下了她的倩影。他多年前就画过她，后来把她放到一幅描 绘冬晨的版画里，最近还公开展出过。她倒是冬晨的一个很恰当的象征。 我们看到她正朝修道院花园四教堂走去（在画面上，她确实是在走着），一 个面黄肌瘦的小厮捧着祈祷书，跟在她后边。
大尉也很聪明，他懂得美貌不过是转瞬即逝的东西，他宁可娶这么一 位小姐而得到他所巴望的种种实际好处。世上有一种聪明人，他们认为女 性的姿色无非是过眼云烟，不值分文；说得更老实些，他们宁可跟一个丑 八怪结婚而过华贵生活，也不愿娶上一位如花似玉的美人而忍受清贫。大 尉就是这样一位。他胃口好，不挑肥拣瘦，所以自信尽管在婚筵上缺了美 色这味佐料，也一定颇能尽兴。
跟读者明白说吧，自从大尉来到了奥尔华绥府上一一至少也是从他哥 哥向他提起这门亲事那时起，远在他发现白丽洁小姐对他有任何倾心的表 示以前，他就已经神魂颠倒地爱上了一一那就是说，爱上了奥尔华绥先生 的家宅、花园、田亩，以及祖传下来和佃租出去的产业。大尉对这一切爱 得如此之热烈，纵令叫他娶隐多耳［鸟的女巫四作为附带条件，只要能跟这些 房屋田地成为终身伴侣，他大概也会欣然同意的。
既然奥尔华绥先生曾经对医生说过，他再也不想续弦，而这妹妹又是 他最近的亲属；医生还探听到，他打算立他妹妹膝下的孩子为嗣一一这一 点即使奥尔华绥不作表示，法律也会替他这么办的。因此，医生和他的兄 弟都认为，能替这个富贵之家养下个吃用不尽的娃娃来，倒也是桩功德无 量的事。于是，兄弟俩就使尽心机去博得这位和蔼可亲的小姐的欢心。
福神恰似慈母，它为自己的宠儿所做往往超过了他所应得的或盼望得 到的。它对大尉就大帮其忙。正当他想方设法去实现他的计划时，小姐刚 好对他也怀了同样的念头，正在考虑怎样既不显得孟浪（她对一切礼法体 统都是严格遵守的），又能适当地给大尉点鼓励。这一点她很容易就办到 了，因为大尉无时无刻不在留意着，她的一言一语，每个眼色和手势，他 都不会放过的。
大尉从白丽洁小姐对他的垂青中，得到很大满足，但这种满足却由于 他对奥尔华绥先生存有戒心而打了不小的折扣。尽管奥尔华绥先生口头上 曾表示不在乎钱财，大尉却总担心在实际行动中，奥尔华绥先生必然会按 照人之常情，不肯答应这桩对他妹妹说来是十分不合算的婚事。大尉究竟 是从什么高明人那里讨教来的这种见解，请读者自己去判断吧。不管是从 何而来，反正他陷入了一种莫名其妙的窘境，不知如何才既能向小姐表达 情意，又不让她哥哥有所察觉。他终于决定利用一切背地里追求她的机 会，当着奥尔华绥先生的面，举止则尽量检点，免得露出马脚。医生对这 办法也颇赞成。
于是，大尉就用毫不隐晦的话语向情人求起婚来，并且也得到了应有 的回答一一那是几千年前就做过的回答，尔后由母亲传给女儿，世世代代 -直这么传下来。倘或要我把它译成拉丁文，大致就是这样：Nolo Episcopar■网。这句话在另外一种场合也不知已使用过多少年了。
不管大尉是怎么知道的，反正他完全领会了小姐的心意，接着就更加 热烈、诚恳地又向她求婚。她按照规定的礼数，又谢绝了。四可是男人要求 得越来越热烈，小姐按照惯例，谢绝得也就越来越不坚决了。
我们不想把这段求婚一幕幕地描绘出来，免得读者感到厌烦。（尽管 某大作家认为，对演出者本人说来，求婚是一生中最快活不过的一场戏； 但是在观众看来，也许再没有比这更乏味的了。）总之，大尉按照礼数向 白丽洁小姐这座堡垒节节进攻，堡垒也按照礼数步步防御。最后，仍然按 照应有的礼数，无条件地投了降。
在这近一个月的攻守战中，大尉当着奥尔华绥先生的面，对他妹妹总 是冷冰冰的。暗地里他追求得越是顺利，人前他越是不动声色。至于白丽 洁小姐，她一把情人得到手，当着旁人就对他十分冷淡。这么一来，除非 奥尔华绥先生有魔鬼般的神通（要不然就是有魔鬼身上更坏的品质），否 则他丝毫也不会怀疑到在他身边玩的这些把戏。
第十二章
本章的内容也许是读者料得到的事
随便什么谈判，关于打仗也好，结婚也好，或者其他类似的事情，只 要双方确有诚意，事先不需什么繁文缛节就可以圆满解决。当前，大尉和 白丽洁小姐正是这样。不上一个月，他们俩就成为夫妇了。
现在顶重要的是如何告知奥尔华绥先生。这件事就由医生来出马。
于是，一天正当奥尔华绥先生在园子里漫步的时候，医生就踱到他跟 前，神情十分严肃，尽量装出忧心忡忡的样子说道："我有件极其要紧的事 想来告诉您。可是该怎么说好呢？我一想到这件事，就心乱如麻。"于是， 他首先把普天下的男女都痛骂了一阵，说男人就只顾自己合适，旁的一概 不去考虑；说女人家总好动邪念，可不能放她们跟男人一道厮混。"先生， 我怎能料得到，"他说，"这么稳重，这么有眼力，又这么有学问的一位小 姐，居然也会为这种轻率的感情所惑呢？我又怎能料得到我这个兄弟一一 我凭什么还称他作兄弟呢？他已经不再是我的兄弟啦一一”
"他当然还是，"奥尔华绥说，"而且他也是我的兄弟。”
"天哪，"医生说，"那么您已经晓得这件可怕的事了？"
"布利非先生，我告诉您，"那位好心人说，"'凡事总要往好处想'，这 是我一生向来遵守的一句格言。尽管舍妹比我年轻得多，她至少也到了明 辨是非的岁数。令弟要是骗上了个小姑娘，那我是不会轻易原谅他的；可 是一个三十开外的女人总应该晓得什么会使她终身幸福。她嫁的是一位绅 士。尽管论家当也许比不上她，如果她在这位绅士身上看到某些优点，足 以弥补这方面的缺陷，我没理由去反对她为自己的幸福所做的选择。跟舍 妹一样，我也不认为幸福仅仅在于拥有巨万家资。我已经三番五次地表示 过，不论谁向她求婚，我大概都会同意的；我原以为这件事她总会跟我商 量一下的。不过，男女间的事儿是非常微妙的。或许她害臊得厉害，实在 不好意思开口。至于令弟，我一点儿也不见怪。他不欠我什么情分，我也 不认为他该来征求我的同意。像我刚才所说的，既然舍妹已经到达sui juris㈤的年龄，她完全可以对自己的一切行动负责。”
医生又重复了一遍对他兄弟的责备，还嫌奥尔华绥先生未免过分宽大 了，并且表示从今以后，要跟他这个兄弟断绝关系，永不再见面。接着，
他又满口称赞奥尔华绥先生的好心肠，竭力颂扬他的隆情厚谊。末了说， 不管怎样他也不能饶恕他兄弟，害得他险些丧失了奥尔华绥先生的友谊。
奥尔华绥这样回答他说："纵令我对令弟有什么不高兴的地方，也绝不 会迁怒到无辜者的身上。不过，请放心，我对他丝毫没有不高兴。我看他 是位有头脑，讲信义的人。我不认为我的妹妹眼力差，毫不怀疑令弟也是 同样爱她的。我一向觉得爱情才是使夫妻生活美满的唯一基础。只有爱情 才能产生崇高而真挚的友谊，夫妻关系永远必须靠它来加强。在我看来， 凡出于旁的用意缔结的婚姻都是罪大恶极的，都是对这种无比神圣的结合 的侮辱；结果往往会造成家庭不和，痛苦万分。把这种至圣至洁的关系作 为贪婪或色欲的邪恶的牺牲品，当然可以说是一种亵渎行为。对那些只为 了贪图姿色或财产就贸然结成的婚姻，除此之外，还有什么更恰当的说法 呢？
"如果否认美能使人赏心悦目，甚至是颇值得赞赏的，那是虚伪的，也 是愚蠢的。《圣经》里就时常使用'美'这个形容词，而且总是带着赞扬的意 味。我自己很幸运，曾经娶过一位人人都认为长得漂亮的女人。老实说， 我也因此而更加喜爱她。可是倘若缔结婚姻时只考虑这一点，只知一味追 求美色，以致忽略了对方的一切缺点；或者对美色的要求是如此绝对，以 致只要对方有欠漂亮，就抹煞对方天性里一切更为完善得多的东西一一把 诸如信仰、道德和见识统统置之不问；这种做法不论对一个明达人或基督 教徒来说，当然都是不相称的。要是认为对这类人来说，除了满足肉欲之 外，婚姻还有别的意义，那就未免太宽厚了一一而我们都晓得，婚姻并不 是为满足肉欲而制定的。
"其次是关于财产。为了做到饱暖无虞，一个人对这方面必须有所考 虑，我也决不能不分青红皂白一概加以责备。按照社会的结构，不论从婚 后生活的需要或是从抚养子女来说，我们都必须稍微留意一下所谓的家 境。可是愚昧和虚荣心制造出许许多多不正常的欲求，贮存下的财富远远 超出实际的需要。于是，连为妻子置备下的装饰品，替子女攒下的巨额财 产，照例都列为不可缺少的项目。为了获得这一切，真正坚实而可贵的东 西，高贵而圣洁的东西，一概遭到了忽略和漠视。
"这种情形严重的程度各有不同，发展到了极端，就会跟疯狂没什么两 样。我指的是那些拥有万贯家资的人，为了进一步扩充他们那本已享用不 尽的家业，居然不惜与他们所嫌弃（也是他们不能不嫌弃）的人一一傻子
和坏蛋去结为夫妻。不用说，这种人倘若不愿意旁人把他们当作疯子，就 必得承认他们根本不懂得享受夫妻之间那种温柔体贴的情谊，要么就得承 认他们是为了迎合一些不着边际、反复无常和糊涂的世俗之见，竟然牺牲 掉他们本来可以享受的人间至福，而这种见解产生于愚昧，它的力量也来 自愚昧。”
奥尔华绥先生的一番训诫到此结束了。布利非聚精会神地倾听着，不 过他费了好大劲，肌肉才没紧张得打颤。他对听到的话句句加以赞扬，那 股殷勤勤儿有如一位年轻的教士三生有幸，与当天曾登台讲道的主教大人 同席共餐。
第十三章
第一卷到此结束;本章里有一桩忘恩负义的事，希望读者看得出它 是违反常情的
读者看完前边那段话，恐怕会料到这场和解（倘若可以这么说的话） 也只不过是一种形式而已。因此，我们也就略过不提，马上来谈谈大家想 必会认为是实质性的问题。
医生把他和奥尔华绥先生之间这段经过告诉了他兄弟之后，笑了笑 说："我确实告诉他说，我已经和你断绝了关系，我甚至要求那个好人，无 论如何也别原谅你。你要知道，他既然替你那么辩护了一番，而他为人又 是如此之宽厚，我向他这么要求是用不着担什么心的。不论是为了你还是 为了我自己，我都希望避免引起任何怀疑。”
布利非大尉当时对这番话毫没在意，可是过后却非常出色地运用了 它。
魔鬼最近一次访问人间时曾给它的徒子徒孙留下若干格言，其中一条 是：一旦爬上马背，立刻就踢开你脚下的板凳。说得浅近一些，就是当你 靠朋友帮忙发迹了之后，最好尽快把他抛开。
我不想一口咬定大尉就是按照这个格言行事的，不过我们可以有把握 地说，他的所作所为完全可以追溯到这条魔鬼的原则上去；除此之外，也 实在难以找到旁的动机。因为他一把白丽洁小姐弄到手，并和奥尔华绥言 归于好，他对哥哥的态度马上就一天比一天冷淡下来；到后来简直发展为 悍然无礼，弄得人人都看出来了。
医生私下里责备他不该如此，结果只不过招出他这么一段露骨的 话："假如您在我内兄家里住得不如意，您尽可以请便，不会有什么人来挽 留的。"可怜的医生，他为大尉这种莫名其妙、残酷而难以理解的忘恩负义 伤透了心。因为天底下最令人心碎的莫过于为了给人帮忙，自己甘愿为非 作歹，事后人家却以怨报德。假若替人帮的忙是件光明磊落的好事，那么 不管事后人家怎样看待这番效劳或如何酬答，反正自己回味起来总还会得 到一些慰藉。但是如果一方面是朋友对我们的忘恩负义，另一方面我们又 受到良心的谴责，怪我们不该为这么个小人而玷污它；在这样一种惨痛的 折磨下，还有什么能够聊以自慰呢？
奥尔华绥先生也在大尉面前替医生说话，希望知道他哥哥究竟怎么开 罪了他。这个狠心的流氓竟然这么卑鄙下流，说他永远也不能原谅他哥哥 曾为了自己的利益而在奥尔华绥先生面前竭力诋毁他。他说，这话是从他 哥哥口里套出来的。他认为他哥哥这件事做得太歹毒了，他怎么也不能原 谅。
奥尔华绥严厉责备大尉这种说法，认为这不近人情。他对大尉这种好 记仇的性格表示十分愤慨。最后，大尉只好装作被说服了，口头上答应同 他哥哥和好。
新娘这时正在蜜月中。她对新郎真是无限恩爱。在她眼里，大尉是不 会有任何过错的。她丈夫生谁的气，就足以使她也生谁的气。
前边已经交代了：大尉只是在奥尔华绥的要求下，才在表面上跟他哥 哥和解的。可是那股怨恨依然埋在心里。他不断找机会私下给他哥哥这种 暗示，终于弄得可怜的医生在这家呆不下去了。他宁可在外面挨饥受冻， 到处飘零，也不愿从他曾经帮过那么多忙的兄弟那里，忍受残酷的、翻脸 不认人的侮辱。
他一度想把事情向奥尔华绥和盘托出，可是他又鼓不起勇气，因为那 样一来，他自己又得担下一大半罪名。况且他把他兄弟形容得越糟糕，在 奥尔华绥眼中他自己的罪名就越大，而且他有理由估计奥尔华绥也越会生 他的气。
因此，他托辞有点事需要料理，就走了，答应过不多久再回来。跟他 兄弟分手的时候，他还装得春风满面，而大尉扮演得也跟他一样精彩。奥 尔华绥先生也就相信他们真的和好如初了。
医生径直到伦敦去了，过不久，就在那里伤心而死。因伤心而死的人 数实际比一般想象的要多得多。如果不是因为它与其他一切病症有个不同 之处一一没有一个医生能治疗它，它在死亡统计表上本应占有显著位置。
仔细考查了这两兄弟过去的经历，我发现除了上述那条恶魔的座右铭 之外，还有一个原因也使得大尉有这般行径：此人除了前边提过的性格 外，为人还极其傲慢凶悍，一向不把与自己的性格不同，在傲慢、凶悍方 面远不如他的那位哥哥放在眼里。但是医生的学问却比弟弟渊博得多，一 般人都说他的天分也比他弟弟高得多。大尉本人也明白这一点，并感到不 能容忍。嫉妒充其量是一种恶毒的情感，一旦再夹杂上鄙夷，那就会变得
更加恶毒。我总觉得，倘若这以外，本人又欠了情分，这三者汇合起来, 所产生的就决不会是感激，而只是愤恨。

第二卷
一对夫妻在人生不同阶段中的幸福情景; 布利非大尉与白丽洁•奥尔华绥小蛆 婚后头两年的其他种种经过
第一章
表明这是怎样一部历史，它像什么，不像什么
尽管我们恰如其分地称这部作品为历史，而不称它为传记，或者目前 更为时髦的"生平辩护录哄，可是我们在这里宁愿遵循那些以阐述各国兴衰 变迁自许的作家所采用的方法，而不去效仿那些连篇累牍、卷帙浩繁的历 史家一一他们为了保持各卷篇幅的划一，就认为不得不把逐年逐月的琐事 统统填到那些平淡无奇、没什么重大史实发生的时期里，从而与在人类历 史舞台上演出过无比壮丽场面的著名时期耗用同样多的纸张。
这种历史实际上很像报纸，不管有没有新闻，横竖它总是那么多篇 幅。还可以把它比作驿车，不管是放空车还是载满了乘客，它总是在同一 段路程上行走。这种历史家大概认为他不得不跟时光亦步亦趋，他就是时 光的记录者。不论是世界处于仿佛昏睡般的、像修道院一样死气沉沉的那 几个世纪，还是像一位优秀的拉丁诗人⑵以下面这段诗出色地加以描述的灿 烂辉煌、生龙活虎的时代，这种历史家都踅着跟他的主人（时光）同样徐 缓的步伐。
Ad confligendum venientibus undique penis,
Omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu Horrida contremuere sub altis 田theris auris ； In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum Omuibus humanis esset, terraque marique.［习
我们原希望给读者以较好的译文，但是力不从心，只好引用克利芝［4］先 生的译文如下：
可怕的迦太基动干戈威胁罗马, 剧烈的恐怖使全球震撼。 哪方将沦亡，哪方将勃兴， 称霸世界，仍在未定之天。
底下我们打算采取相反的一种写法：每逢遇到重大非凡的场面（我们 相信这种场面会时常出现的），作者就不惮麻烦，不吝惜笔墨，为读者详
详细细地描绘出来。倘若几个年头流逝过去，其间并没有发生什么值得大 家注意的事情，作者不怕让这部历史出现一段空白，就不去评论什么，而 兼程前进去描写重大事件。
老实说，我们应该把这些时期看作时间大彩票的空签。作为这种彩票 的记录员，我们要效法某些聪明人，他们经售在市政厅里抽的彩票，不论 有多少空签，他们也从来不向公众说东道西；可是倘或有一张中了大彩， 就一定在报端大登特登，让天下人都晓得彩票是哪家卖出去的。说真的， 通常总有两三家争这张彩票经销者的光荣。我料想这无非是为了让冒险家 们相信某某经纪人是财富之神的亲信，甚至还参与其内阁会议。
这样，读者在阅读本书时如果发现某几章很短，某几章又颇长；有的 只记载一天的事情，另外的又包含经年累月的事；总之，如果他发现这部 历史有时似乎停滞下来，有时又如风驰电掣地疾行，请不要感到奇怪。我 不认为有义务在任何批评家的法庭上替自己进行答辩，因为事实上我是一 种新的写作领域［5］的开拓者，我可以任意制定这个领域内的法律。我把我的 读者看作我的子民，他们必须相信并且服从这些法律。为了让他们能够毫 不勉强、心甘情愿地做到这一点，我在此向他们保证，制定这些法律时我 首先考虑的是他们的方便和利益。我并不像凭"君权神授论"来进行统治的 专制君王那样把他们视为我的奴隶或工具。我所以向读者这样指指点点， 诚然也是为了他们的好处。我是生而供他们使用，不是他们生而供我使用 的。我也毫不怀疑既然我把他们的利益看作我写作时的重大准绳，他们也 会一致维护我的权威，给我以应得或希望得到的一切荣誉。
第二章
从宗教观点劝诫人们对私生子不可过分宠爱；德波拉大娘的一个非 同小可的发见
布利非大尉和那位姿色非凡、品德既高又有资财的年轻姑娘白丽洁•奥 尔华绥小姐行过婚礼八个月之后，白丽洁小姐由于受了惊吓，立即生下个 胖儿子。这娃娃看来着实挑不出毛病，只不过接生婆发现他早产了一个 月。
对奥尔华绥先生说来，自己亲爱的妹妹添了子嗣，当然是件大喜事； 然而这事并没转移他对那个小弃儿的眷爱。他已经当了孩子的教父［6］，并且 照自己的名字给他起名为托马斯。他很少忘记到婴儿室去看他，每天至少 也要走上一遭。
他对他妹妹说，如果她愿意的话，可以把这新生的娃娃跟小汤米［刀一起 抚养。白丽洁稍微犹豫了一下，然而还是同意了。她对哥哥确乎是百依百 顺的，因此，对这小弃儿总是很仁慈，这远远不是一般严守礼法的妇女所 能做到的一一不管私生子本身多么清白无辜，他总归是淫乱行为的一个活 见证啊。
但是大尉认为奥尔华绥先生的办法十分不对头，他不大肯接受。他屡 次向奥尔华绥先生暗示收养罪恶的果实就等于纵容罪恶。他引用了好几段 经文（他把《圣经》读得烂熟），诸如"憎恨我的人我要惩罚他们"，［8］"父 亲吃了酸葡萄，儿子的牙齿酸坏了"，凹来论证在私生子身上惩罚其父母的 罪过是完全合理合法的。他说："尽管法律并没明文规定可以消灭这种出身 卑贱的孩子，然而它却把私生子看作野种。教会也认为他们是野种，养大 了充其量只能担负些社会上最卑贱的劳役。”
对大尉这番话以及关于这个问题他所发表的其他许多宏论，奥尔华绥 先生都作了答复。他说："不管做父母的罪孽多么深重，孩子确实是无辜 的。至于你所引用的经文，第一句是专门谴责犹太人崇拜偶像、背弃和憎 恨上帝的罪过的，第二句只是个比喻，意在表明罪恶所必然招致的无可避 免的后果，并非确指任何惩罚而言。但是倘若把万能之主形容成在无辜者 身上来报复有罪者所造的罪孽，那即使不是亵渎神明，也是很恶劣的；因 为这等于说，上帝是逆着天理的首要原则及是非的起码概念行事的，而那 些正是他所灌输给我们，要我们不但据以判断还未启示过的事物，甚至也
据以判断启示•也本身的真实性。"他说，在私生子这个问题上，他晓得不少 人与大尉抱同样见解，但是他自己却完全不以为然。他要好好抚养这个可 怜的娃娃，把他看作幸而在他床上被拾到的一个合法出生的孩子。
正当大尉抓住一切机会来鼓吹诸如此类的说法，想把这小弃儿从奥尔 华绥先生家里赶走的时候（他开始因奥尔华绥先生对汤姆的钟爱而感到嫉 妒），德波拉大娘发现了一件事，这个发现给可怜的汤米带来的后果恐怕 至少也比大尉所有的论证还要来得严重。
这位好女人干这件事究竟是出于她那无止境的好奇心呢，还是为了讨 布利非太太的欢心，我且不在这里断言一一尽管布利非太太表面上对弃儿 很好，暗地里却常骂他，也骂他哥哥不该那么疼爱那孩子。不管怎样吧， 德波拉大娘相信这下子可把弃儿的父亲彻底追查出来了。
既然这个发现关系重大，恐怕需要追溯一下事情的原委。因此，我们 要将这个发现的来龙去脉详详细细交代一番。为了做到这一点，我们就不 得不把迄今对读者还完全陌生的一个小户人家的一切秘密揭露出来。这个 家庭的格局真是稀奇古怪，我担心许多已婚的男女，不管平日多么轻信， 读了也将难以置信。
第三章
与亚里士多德［11】的原则完全背道而驰的一种家庭体制
读者大约还记得，前文中曾讲过珍妮-琼斯在一位塾师家里做过几年 工。由于她的恳求，塾师教了她拉丁文。她倒也不曾辜负自己那份天资， 进步很快，学得居然比老师还更胜一筹。
尽管就这位可怜人从事的行当来说，学问是必不可少的，然而他最不 擅长的却是这方面。他是天底下脾气最好的人之一，而且又善于谈笑，+ 分幽默，在乡下颇有些才子名气；左近的缙绅莫不争相和他交往。此人颇 不惯执意推谢，因此，就把大部分时间都消磨在他们的府第中。其实，倘 若他把时光用在私塾里，对他的益处也许要大得多呢。
以这位塾师的资历和生性而论，可以想见他是不会成为伊顿或威斯敏 斯特学校M的勤敌的。明确地说，他门下的学生一共分作两班：高班的学生 只有左近一位乡绅的大少爷，今年已十七岁，却刚学造句；低班的学生是 这位绅士的二少爷，他和教区里七个孩子都刚刚开蒙。
除了教书之外，这位塾师还兼营抄写及理发行当。此外，奥尔华绥先 生每年又赠给他+镑津贴。不然的话，单靠束脩，他是过不上舒适的生活 的。每逢圣诞节，这可怜人就能把津贴领到手，这笔赠金也就足以使他欢 度佳节了。
在塾师所藏的几件宝贝当中，有一件就是他的老婆。她本是奥尔华绥 先生家的厨娘，塾师是看上了她的财产才娶她的一一共计二十镑，这是她 做工时积攒下来的。
这女人长得不怎么可爱。究竟我的朋友贺加斯画过她的尊容没有，我 不能断言；不过她的相貌跟《荡妇历程》珥第三幅里那个给女主人斟茶的少 妇一模一样。此外，她还是古代赞蒂璧也］所创立的高贵教派的忠实信徒。因 此，在那私塾里，她比丈夫来得威风。说实在的，不论在私塾里还是在旁 处，只要有她在场，塾师就什么也做不了主。
从相貌上本来就看不出她性格里有多少温柔，而经常损害伉俪感情的 一种情况或许又更使她那点温柔磨灭殆尽了。孩子是爱情的保障，这是至 理名言。然而他们结婚几年了，她丈夫却还没有给她这种保障。对这一缺 陷他是找不到借口的。论年纪，他还不到三十；论体格，又是通常所谓的 血气方刚的壮小伙子。
这就又引起另一种灾难，它也给可怜的塾师带来不少的罪受。这位太 太经常要吃醋，弄得她丈夫简直不敢跟教区里的女人说话。只要他对任何 女人表示一点点礼貌，或甚至打个招呼，不论他本人还是那个女人，都免 不了要遭到她一顿打闹。
她雇用着一个女仆。为了保障她的家庭幸福不至于在自己屋里受到侵 害，在女仆的人选上她极为慎重，总是从那些相貌足以替她们本人的贞操 打保票的女人中来挑。前面介绍给读者的珍妮,琼斯就是其中的一个。
由于这个年轻女人的容貌颇足以提供上述保证，又由于她举止很有分 寸（有头脑的女人必然会如此），所以她在巴特里奇（这便是塾师的名 字）家呆了四年多而没引起过女主人丝毫的怀疑。不但如此，女主人还格 外开恩，准许巴特里奇先生教她功课，这一点前边已经提到过了。
然而妒忌心正像痛风症一样，一旦进了血液，就难保它不发作；而且 往往是借着很小一个岔子，在最意料不到的时候发作。
巴特里奇太太就是这样。四年来，她一直准许丈夫教这个年轻女人拉 丁文。为了用功，珍妮屡次耽误家务活儿，巴特里奇太太都容忍下来了。 有一天，正当那个姑娘念着书，她的老师俯在她的椅背上的时际，女主人 从旁边走过。不知怎的，那姑娘猛地站了起来。从那次起就引起了女主人 的怀疑。
不过这种怀疑当时并没表露出来，只是潜藏在她心里，像个埋伏着的 敌人，要等生力军来增援，才会公开宣战开火。转眼之间生力军果然到达 了，证实了她的怀疑。过不多日子，夫妻俩正吃饭的时候，男主人对女仆 说："Da mihi aliquid potum.m那个倒霉的姑娘听了笑了笑一一她笑的 也许是那句拉丁文太蹩脚。这当儿，女主人瞅了她一眼。她大概是由于嘲 笑了男主人而感到不好意思，就绯红了脸。巴特里奇太太看到这般情景， 立刻勃然大怒，抄起盛着饭的木盘就朝可怜的珍妮头上掼去。同时嚷 道："你这不要脸的婊子，居然当着我面就跟我男人捣起鬼来啦！"随说随 拿着刀子站了起来。倘若不是那姑娘比她更靠近门口，马上逃之夭夭，避 开了她的盛怒，女主人很可能挥动手里的武器，造成十分可怕的惨剧。至 于她那可怜的丈夫，不是由于事出意外，慌乱中不知所措，就是由于吓得 心惊胆战（这一点也是十分可能的），以致不敢起来抵抗，只是目瞪口呆 地瘫在椅子上打哆嗦，一动不动，一声不响。直到他老婆追珍妮回来，他
才采取些必要的措施来保全自己，效法那个女仆的榜样，不得不撤退。
这个好女人跟奥瑟罗一样，也是这种性格的人:
在嫉妒里消磨他的一生, 随着每次月亮的圆缺， 发生新的怀疑一一
她也跟奥瑟罗一样:
――一旦起疑， 就要登时解决。［项
于是，她吩咐珍妮立刻收拾行李滚蛋，因为她已经拿定主意，决不让那姑 娘当晚还睡在她家里。
巴特里奇先生已经有过足够的教训，对这类性质的事体决不过问。因 此，他就采用一贯有效的处方：忍耐。尽管他对拉丁文不算精通，然而他 却还记得这句格言，并且对之深有体会：
--Leve fit, quod bene fertur onus,
翻译出来就是：
――担子虽重，善挑能变轻。
这句话他总是挂在嘴边上。事实上，他倒也经常有机会来证实这句格言的 真理。
珍妮本打算替自己的清白辩护一下，可是这场风暴来势过猛，不容她 有申诉的余地。于是，她只好去收拾行李。她的东西不多，几张牛皮纸尽 够她全部包上了。结了小小一笔工钱之后，珍妮就回家去了。
那晚上，塾师夫妻俩过得自是很不愉快。可是夫妻无隔宿之怨，第二 天天还没亮，巴特里奇太太的怒气就已经消掉一些。她这才准许丈夫来辩
解，也马上相信了他的申辩，因为他并没要求把珍妮叫回来，而是对赶掉 她这件事表示满意。他说，珍妮整天只顾用功，越来越失去一个女仆的作 用了，还变得非常固执，没规矩。珍妮确实近来常跟男主人争论学问上的 问题，并且正如我们前边提到过的，在这方面她已经大大超过了主人一一 尽管巴特里奇先生无论如何也不承认这一点。珍妮坚持自己是正确的，他 却说她固执，他对她也就开始恨之入骨了。
第四章
家庭史上一场空前的大血战一一或者说，一场大决斗
由于前一章里所阐述的理由，以及大部分做丈夫的所熟知的夫妻生活 中其他某些让步（这些让步有如共济会叫的内幕，是不得向未曾加入该体面 团体的人泄露的），巴特里奇太太深信自己是无故冤枉了丈夫。于是，她 就使出种种柔情蜜意来补偿他所受的委屈。巴特里奇太太的感情不论用在 哪方面，确乎都是同样的猛烈。她可以大发雷霆，也可以变得百般温存。
她这两种情感通常总是此起彼伏的。塾师很少度过二十四小时而不在 某种程度上轮流充当它们发泄的目标。可是遇到特殊情况，每逢她的脾气 发得格外厉害时，和缓的时期也会长久一些。当前就是这样。这股醋勤过 去之后，巴特里奇太太的温柔体贴延续的时间之久，对她丈夫说来是空前 的。倘若不是赞蒂璧的全体信徒每天都必须数落几阵子作为每日功课的 话，巴特里奇先生大可享受几个月清福哩。
当海面一平如镜的时候，饱有经验的水手往往会看出风暴即将到来的 征兆。我还晓得有些人一般并不怎么迷信，可也总认为异乎寻常的和平、 宁静之后，必然会继之以风波。因此，古人每遇到这种情景，便向复仇女 神献祭，认为这位女神总是用妒忌的眼光注视着人类的幸福，并专以破坏 这种幸福为乐。
我们绝不信奉这种异教邪神，也不想去助长迷信，因此，很希望约翰， 弗XXM先生或别位哲学家动动脑筋，找出好运突然转为歹运的真正原因。 这种转变自古以来屡见不鲜，下面我们就试举一例。我们的职责只在叙述 事实，至于构成事实的原因，就只好留给高明人士去解释了。
人类一向都十分喜欢打听并谈论旁人的所作所为。因此，任何时代， 在任何国家里，都有专供公众集会的场所，好奇的人们可以在那里相聚， 彼此满足各自的好奇心。在这些场所中，理发店应当说是头等的地方。在 希腊，"理发店里的新闻"差不多成了一句谚语。贺拉斯也在他的一封书简 里就根据同一见解大为赞扬罗马的理发师。
大家都知道，英国理发师决不比他们希腊或罗马的先辈逊色。在这 里，大家纵谈起海外事务来一点也不比咖啡馆图差，谈起国内新闻来则比在 咖啡馆里更要海阔天空，无拘无束。不过理发店只是为男人而设的。既然 我们英国的妇女一一尤其下层社会的妇女一一比旁的国家里的妇女更喜欢
聚在一起谈天说地，而女性的好奇心又决不低于男性，那么倘若不另设个 场所来满足它，我们的社会就未免大有缺陷了。
在享有一个集会场所这一点上，我们英国妇女理应感到比外国的姊妹 幸运，因为不论阅读历史或赴各地游历，我都不记得曾遇到过类似的地 方。
我所指的不是别处，正是杂货铺。这是以散布各种新闻著称的地方 ――说得通俗些，也就是每个英国教区嚼舌根子的地方。
有一天，巴特里奇太太参加了女人们的这个集会。一个邻居问她近来 可曾听到什么关于珍妮的消息，她回答说没有。对方就笑了笑说，多亏她 把珍妮赶掉了，教区非常感激她。
读者都知道巴特里奇太太那股醋勤早已消失了，她又再没旁的事情可 以责怪那个女仆的，就直爽地回答说：她不晓得在这件事情上教区有什么 可感激她的。她还认为自从珍妮走了以后，她难得再找一个像她那么好的 女仆呢。
"当真找不出来啦，"那个长舌妇说，"我也巴不得是这样，虽然我估量 这种骚货咱们这儿有的是。这么说来，你大概没听到她养下了两个野种的 事吧！不过她不是在咱们这个教区里养的，所以我家男人和另一个司务丝都 说，用不着咱们教区来抚养。”
"两个野种！”巴特里奇太太赶快说，"这我可真没料到。该不该由咱们 这教区来收养，我倒不敢说。可是我相信这婊子一定是在咱们这儿怀的身 子，因为她离开这儿还不到九个月。”
再没有比思想的闪动更迅速、更突兀的了，尤其当它由希冀、恐惧或 妒忌推动的时候一一而其中又以妒忌为最。巴特里奇太太立刻想起珍妮住 在她家的时候，几乎从来没离开过屋子。一刹那间，那天她丈夫俯到珍妮 椅背上和她猛地惊起的情景，珍妮学的拉丁文，她那个笑容，以及其他种 种迹象一下子全涌上心头。看来她丈夫对赶掉珍妮这件事所表示的满意不 过是伪装而已。同时，也可以说是真的，因为他已经玩腻烦了。另外还有 种种数不尽的罪名一齐涌来，燃起她的妒火。一句话，对丈夫有罪这一 点，她认为已确凿无疑。于是，她马上就心慌意乱地走了。
尽管那美丽的老母猫在猫族中辈份最小，然而它的残酷却不亚于同族 里年长位尊的支派；它力气虽然较差，可是其凶悍却比得上那高贵的老 虎。当一只被它捉弄了半天的小耗子暂从它爪下逃脱时，它马上发起脾气
来责难，号叫，谩骂。一旦把耗子藏躲的箱笼搬开，它就会像闪电般扑到 那只猎物身上，恶狠狠地去抓、咬、撕、嚼那只小动物。
巴特里奇太太朝可怜的塾师扑去时的凶猛，也决不在这以下。她的舌 头、牙齿和双手一齐向他出动。他的假发四立即从头上给扯了下来，衬衣从 脊背上撕裂，脸上流下五道血河，标志出造物不幸用那么多只利爪把对方 武装了起来。
巴特里奇先生最初采取的只是防御战术，一味企图用双手保护自己的 脸。可是后来他发现对方的猛烈攻势丝毫也没减弱下来，于是，他想至少 也该试试解除她的武装，或者不如说，控制住她的胳膊。在这场搏斗中， 巴特里奇太太的帽子掉了，她那披不到肩头的短发直竖在她的头上。她的 胸衣只在底下有个眼，系着一根带子，一下子绷开了。两只大奶倒不像头 发那么可怜，一直垂到肚皮底下去。她脸上沾着丈夫的血，气得直咬牙， 眼睛就像铁匠的熔炉那样往外冒着火苗。即使比巴特里奇先生胆子大得多 的男人见了这位女中豪杰，也要为之吓倒的。
谢天谢地，巴特里奇先生终于抓住了她的胳膊，从而使得长在她指尖 上的武器失掉了效用。她一看到这般情势，女性的脆弱立刻压倒了她的狂 暴，她不禁涕泪如雨，随后便昏迷不醒了。
在这场他丝毫不知因何而起的风暴中，巴特里奇先生勉强保留下来的 一点点理智，这时也完全丧失了。他马上奔到街上，大声嚷叫他老婆眼看 要一命呜呼了，哀求四邻赶快来帮忙抢救。有几个好心的女人应声来到， 用通常治这种毛病的老法子，使巴特里奇太太终于缓过气来，她丈夫非常 吉\\/ 何兴。
巴特里奇太太的神志刚刚恢复一些，喝点药酒镇定一下，马上就向在 场的人控诉她丈夫如何百般虐待她；在她的床铺上干出这种不干不净的事 还不算，她刚一责备，他居然使出惨无人道的手段来对付她，扯下她的帽 子，揪掉她的头发，扯碎她的胸衣，还揍了她好几下子，害得她将来死了 都得带着伤痕进棺材！
其实，这位可怜的丈夫脸上所挂的他老婆盛怒的痕迹要多得多，也明 显得多；他却只得愕然听着她那通控诉，默不作声。我相信读者诸公也会 证明她的控诉与事实有很大出入，因为巴特里奇先生确实一巴掌也没打过 她。然而他的沉默不语却被全体法官理解为供认不讳。于是，她们立刻就 异口同声地斥责他，咒骂他，一再说只有胆小鬼才会动手打女人。
巴特里奇先生一声没吭，隐忍了这一切。可是当她老婆指着自己脸上 的血迹来证明他的残暴时，他才不禁申辩说，那是他本人的血，而事实也 确是如此。他觉得自己的血反过来作为自己动武的罪证，而非被害人的血 成为行凶的罪证，未免太荒唐了。
听到这番辩解，那几个女人只是回答说：可惜那只是从他脸上流出来 的血，而不是从他心里流出来的。她们一齐宣布，倘若自己的丈夫胆敢动 手打人的话，她们就非叫他把心里的血流出来不可。
这些女人把巴特里奇先生过去的行为斥责了一大顿，又对他今后的品 行进了不少忠告，然后才走开，留下这对夫妇去单独谈话。不久，巴特里 奇先生也就摸清他这场灾难的根由了。
第五章
许多足以锻炼读者判断和思考能力的事物
天下很少只有一个人晓得的机密，这句至理名言我看着实有些道理。 像上面叙述的这类事情，既然整个教区都晓得了，要不传到外边去，那才 近乎奇迹呢。
果然不出几天，小巴丁顿的塾师毒打老婆的消息就在附近一带（用句 通俗的话说）哄传开了。有的地方甚至说，他把巴特里奇太太谋害了 ；有 的谣传打折了她的双臂，也有的说把她的腿敲断了。总之，照各处的种种 谣传，凡是人类所能遭受的伤害，她在丈夫手里几乎全遭到了。
关于这次吵架的起因，也有各式各样的传闻。有的说巴特里奇先生正 跟女仆睡觉，当场给老婆抓住；另外也还传出许许多多很不同的说法，有 些人甚至倒过来说是老婆偷汉子，吃醋的是丈夫。
威尔根斯大娘早就听说巴特里奇两口子吵架这件事，可是由于她听到 的是和引起争吵的真正原因不同的说法，她觉得还是以不去宣扬为宜。大 家一致责备的是巴特里奇先生，而巴特里奇太太过去在奥尔华绥先生家里 做工的时候，曾为了一件什么事情开罪过威尔根斯太太一一这位女管家生 来是不大肯勾销旧账的。
然而威尔根斯大娘眼光很远，又能预卜几年以后的事。她已经看出布 利非大尉将来很可能当上她的东家，并且也很清楚布利非大尉对小弃儿不 怀什么好感。她料想倘能发现一些什么把柄足以使奥尔华绥先生减少对这 孩子的疼爱，自然也就是替大尉办了一件让他十分称心的事。奥尔华绥先 生对这孩子的疼爱显然令大尉十分不安，甚至在奥尔华绥先生跟前他也无 法完全掩饰起自己这种情绪。他的夫人在人前的举止比他要得体多了。她 时常劝他学学她的榜样，对她哥哥做的糊涂事睁一只眼闭一只眼。她说， 她至少和旁人一样看得出这种行为是不明智的，她的愤慨也不亚于别人。 尽管她这么劝说，大尉的不安却依然如故。
因此，尽管塾师夫妇吵架之后，相隔很久，威尔根斯大娘才偶然打听 到这件事情的真相，她还是把全部细节调查个一清二楚，然后告诉大尉 说，她终于把小野种的真父亲追究出来了。她还说，看到东家这么关怀弃 儿，毁了自己在这一带乡里的名誉，心里真是难受。
大尉责备她结尾那段话说得太僭妄，认为那是对东家的举动擅自乱下 判语。虽然在品德或见识上大尉允许自己跟威尔根斯大娘结成一伙，自尊 心却绝不允许他那么做。老实说，再没有比跟你朋友的仆人勾结起来反对 他们的主人更为冒失的事了，因为这么一来，事后你只能任凭那些仆人摆 布，随时还可能被他们出卖。也许正由于这种顾虑，大尉才没对威尔根斯 大娘作什么明白表示，也没助长她去说奥尔华绥的坏话。
尽管表面上他对威尔根斯大娘这个发现没露出满意的神色，心里却颇 为高兴，并且打算尽情利用一下。
这件事他在心里藏了很长一个时期，满心盼着奥尔华绥先生会从旁人 口里听到它，可是威尔根斯大娘也许被大尉的态度所惹恼，要不就是对大 尉的权术世故有些莫测高深，唯恐这个发现会使他不高兴，从那以后就再 也没提过这事。
女人们不管听到什么新闻，与其告诉男人，总更喜欢告诉别的女人。 想起来有些奇怪，这女管事可一直没把这消息报告给布利非太太。要解答 这个疑问，只有将它归之于女主人和她之间关系比较疏远。这也可能是由 于威尔根斯过分关心小弃儿，以致引起了布利非太太的妒忌。因为这位女 管事虽然为了讨好大尉，总想害那小弃儿，可是看到奥尔华绥先生越来越 疼爱他，她也就在主人面前越来越夸奖起他来了。这也许就得罪了这位难 伺候的夫人，使她对威尔根斯大娘十分怨恨，尽管她背着东家也煞费苦心 地对布利非太太说过些完全相反的话。虽然她不曾（也许是不能）把她干 脆赶走，可是总想方设法叫她不自在。这终于惹恼了威尔根斯大娘，她就 反抗起布利非太太来，公然对小汤米表示出百般的敬重和爱抚。
大尉担心那件传闻颇有烟消雾散的危险，最后只好抓个机会自己把它 吐露出来。
有一天，他跟奥尔华绥先生讨论起爱四的问题。大尉旁征博引地向奥尔 华绥先生证明，在《圣经》里"爱"这个字没有一处是当作行善或慷慨解释 的。
"基督教的建立是为了更崇高的目的，"他说，"而不是为了实行许多异 教的哲人老早就传给我们的仁爱之道。仁爱虽然也许可以称作一种美德， 但它却很少带有卓绝的基督教气息：也就是那种高超的思想境界，其纯洁 程度接近天使般的完美，而且只有靠神的恩宠才能达到、表现并感觉 到。"他还说："把爱这个字理解为心地热诚，或是对同胞持友善的看法，
对他们的所作所为给予宽厚的评价，这才接近《圣经》的意旨。这种美德 在本质上要比出于怜恤而散发些布施高尚得多，受益的人也广泛得多。纵 使肯于破费，甚至倾家荡产，我们所能救济的人总很有限。反之，倘若从 另外更真实的角度去理解爱的意义，受惠者则可以遍及人类。”
他说："只要想想圣徒都是些什么人姓，却还认为耶稣曾向他们传过待 人要慷慨或应不惜施舍这样的教义，那就太荒谬了。既然我们不能设想耶 稣把这样的道理传给根本不能实行它的人，我们就更不能设想叫那些虽然 能实行而不肯实行的人来这样理解爱了。”
"尽管这种慈善行为算不了什么功德，"他继续说，"可是我必须承认对 于一个心地仁厚的人，那还不失为一种乐趣，只可惜有一种情况使这乐趣 打了折扣一一我指的是我们时常容易受骗，往往把最丰厚的恩惠施给不配 享受的人。您不能不承认，您对巴特里奇那个无赖的恩赐正是这样。只要 有了两三件这样的事例，势必就会大大减少一个好人从这种善行所理应获 得的快慰。这种事例甚至使他施舍起来畏首畏尾，唯恐犯了助长罪恶、鼓 励坏人的过失。这是极其严重的罪过，除非我们十分审慎地选择施恩的对 象，否则事后再说我们并不是存心助长，也不能替自己开脱。我相信这些 考虑已经使许多笃信宗教、德高望重的人士在慷慨解囊方面大大受到了限 制。”
奥尔华绥先生回答说，他没资格跟大尉争论希腊文方面的问题。因 此，关于译作"爱”的这个字的真实意义，他不能表示意见。但他一向把这 个字理解为由某些行动所构成，而赒济施舍至少也构成这种德行的一个方 面。
关于功德这一点，他倒完全同意大尉的看法，因为行善只不过是尽一 个人应尽的责任，哪里谈得上什么功德呢？不管"仁爱"这个字涵义如何， 从《新约》的整个精神来看，它显然是一种责任。现在他既然认为行善是 基督教的教规和自然法则所要求人们履行的一种义不容辞的责任，那它本 身必然就是一件非常愉快的事；而且如果有任何一种责任，它本身就是一 种报偿，或者说，在履行这种责任时就能享受到报答，这个便是了。
"说实在的，"他说，"倒有一种慷慨行为（我宁愿称之为慈善行为）好 像还说得上功德，那就是，我们出于恻隐之心或基督教的爱心，为了减少 旁人的困苦，甚至把自己真正必不可缺的东西也拿出一些分给大家。我认 为这才称得起功德。但是倘若我们只不过用自己多余下来的东西来接济同
胞；倘若由于这种仁爱行为（我必须使用这个词儿）而蒙受些损失的只不 过是我们的钱柜，而不是我们自己；倘若我们从灾难中救出几个家庭的代 价只不过是壁上少挂一幅出色的绘画，或者在旁的方面少满足一项无聊的 虚荣心一一那我们也只不过是尽了做人之道而已。我甚至还可以大胆说一 句，在某种程度上我们也只不过是个美食家：因为最考究的美食家的愿望 还不就是要他的菜饭不止为一张嘴所享受，而为许多张嘴所享受吗？我觉 得这话也可以应用到那些知道由于自己的赒济而使许多人有了饭吃的人们 身上。
"至于怕把恩惠施错了人这一点一一你说事后证明受惠者不配受惠的例 子很多，我认为那并不足以妨碍一个好人去济弱扶贫。我不认为一个人碰 上几件或者许多件忘恩负义的事就使他有理由硬起心肠来，从此对同类所 遭受的苦难无动于衷，我也不相信那情况会对一颗真正仁慈的心发生这样 的影响。除非能说服一个好人，让他相信整个人类已经堕落到不可救药的 地步了，我认为，这下子他不是变成一个无神论者就会害上狂热病，否则 没有力量能封住他的善心。然而只因为有几个坏人就断言全人类都已经堕 落到不可救药的地步了，那显然是不公正的。我相信也没有人会仅仅因为 记得有那么一个出乎常规的例子，就遽然下这样的结论。"这席话说到最 后，他问大尉所说的那个无赖巴特里奇究竟是谁。
"我指的是那个理发匠兼塾师巴特里奇，那个没准行当的家伙，"大尉 说，"他就是您在床铺上发现的那个小孩子的父亲。”
奥尔华绥先生听了大为惊讶，而大尉看到奥尔华绥先生竟茫然不知， 也颇为惊讶。他说，这事他一个多月以前就听说了，然后费了好大勤才想 起是威尔根斯大娘告诉他的。
于是，奥尔华绥先生立刻把威尔根斯喊了来，她证实了大尉的话。奥 尔华绥先生就依照大尉的主意，把她派到小巴丁顿去调查事情的虚实，因 为大尉很不赞成在审理刑事案件方面草率行事。他说，他绝不愿意奥尔华 绥先生在查明巴特里奇的罪行之前，就做出任何不利于孩子或他父亲的决 定。尽管他私下早已从巴特里奇的邻居那里证实了这个消息，然而他为人 厚道，决不肯在奥尔华绥先生面前作见证。

第六章
对塾师巴特里奇淫乱行为的审判；他妻子所作的证言;略论我国法 律之高明；以及熟知底细的人所最乐闻的其他重大事实
大家也许会奇怪这么一件尽人皆知、议论纷纷的事，怎么会一直没人 向奥尔华绥先生提起呢？那一带大概只剩他一个人蒙在鼓里了。
为了就这一点向读者略作说明，我应当告诉大家在我们国家里，没有 谁比这位好人更无意于反对前一章所谈的对慈善行为的解释了。老实说， 无论根据哪种解释，慈善二字他都当之无愧，因为没有谁比他更知人的饥 寒，更乐于济人之急，同时也没有谁比他更珍惜旁人的名誉，轻易不肯听 信有损旁人名声的话。
因此，流言蜚语是绝对钻不到他的餐桌上来的。前人有言：观其友而 知其人。我也不妨大胆说，只要留神听听人们在大人物餐桌上所谈的话， 就足以知悉他对宗教、政治及生活趣味的一些看法，以至他整个的性格。 世上固然有些随处抒发己见的怪物，然而多数人还是很会阿谀奉承，顺着 比自己身份高的人的喜好和意向说话的。
闲话少说，咱们仍旧回到威尔根斯大娘身上来吧。尽管路途有十五哩 之遥，她还是很快就办完了委派给她的差事。她带回关于塾师的确凿罪 证，这样，奥尔华绥先生只好吩咐把这个犯人传来，他要亲口审问。于 是，巴特里奇先生就到庭候审，以便对指控他的这个罪名进行辩护一一如 果他尚能辩护的话。
在指定的时刻，前边提到的巴特里奇、他的妻子安妮以及控告他的威 尔根斯大娘就都来到乐园大厅，听候奥尔华绥先生审问。
这时，奥尔华绥先生在法官席上落座，巴特里奇先生就被带到他跟前 来。听完威尔根斯大娘对他的控诉之后，巴特里奇申明受了冤枉，大呼自 己是清白无辜的。
法官又审讯巴特里奇太太。她先为自己不得不讲出对丈夫不利的事实 真相表示了一番遗憾，然后就把事情的原委（这些读者早已晓得了）详细 陈述了一遍。最后她还说，她丈夫已经向她招认了自己的罪过。
至于她究竟宽恕了她的丈夫没有，这一点我不便妄下断语；可以肯定 的是，她并不情愿来作这个人证。倘若不是威尔根斯大娘手段高明，先在 她家里从她口中套出全部情节，又用奥尔华绥先生的名义向她保证对她丈
夫的惩罚决不至于影响到他的家人的话，由于其他种种原因她大概永远也 不会这么来指控自己的男人的。
巴特里奇虽然承认确曾向他的老婆招认过上述情节，可是他仍然坚持 自己是无辜的。他竭力说明，他所以不得不那么做，是因为他老婆跟他纠 缠不休。她发誓说，她确信他是有罪的，所以他一天不招认，就折磨他一 天。她还认真答应他只要招认下来，就永不再提起此事了。他说尽管自己 明明是无罪的，还是为这个诺言所动，伪称自己有罪一一他相信在同样情 形下，纵使要他招认杀人，他也一定会照办的。
巴特里奇太太可不能心平气和地听他这么非难她。然而当前除了眼泪 以外，她又没旁的可以求助。于是，她就邀来大量的眼泪来支援自己，然 后对奥尔华绥先生说道一一或者不如说，哭道："老爷，世界上再没有比我 更可怜的女人了，受这个下流痞子的欺负。他这不是头一遭骗我了。禀告 老爷，他糟蹋我的床铺不知道有多少回了。要是他光喝酒，不务正业，我 还能忍受；可是他竟触犯了这条戒律。而且，他要是在外头胡搞，我也不 会那么在乎。可是他姘的却是我的女用人，又是在我家里，在我自己家 里，糟践了我自己的干净床铺一一准是的，他跟他那个畜生骚婊子。可不 是嘛，你这个流氓，你糟践了我的床铺，你糟践了。如今你又诬告是我硬 逼你把实情招认出来的。请老爷公断，会是我硬逼他的吗？到今天我还浑 身是伤，这足可以证明他对我有多么狠毒。你这流氓！你要是个男子汉的 话，把女人打成这样子，一定会感到可耻。可是你连半个男子汉也顶不 上，你心里也明白。你也算不上我半个丈夫。你非缠婊子不可，非缠不 可，可是我准知道……禀告老爷，既然他气苦了我，我就索性发誓作证： 我是亲眼看见他俩睡在床上的。什么，你大概忘啦！只为了我委婉地劝了 你一句不该和人通奸，你就打得我死去活来，打得我额头上淌血。可是左 邻右舍都可以替我作证。你简直伤透了……伤透了我的……伤透了我的心 啦！ ”
说到这儿，奥尔华绥先生打断了她的话，劝她平静下来，答应一定替 她主持公道，然后朝巴特里奇转过身来。巴特里奇这时站在那里呆若木 鸡。他那点机智一半因惊讶，一半因恐惧，已经丧失殆尽了。奥尔华绥先 生对他说："世界上竟然有像你这么坏的人，真让我心里难过。"他告诉巴 特里奇，像这样支吾搪塞，来回扯谎，只能加重自己的罪名。巴特里奇要 是想赎罪的话，就只有坦白招认，真诚忏悔。因此，他劝他立刻把事实经
过全部供出来。事情已经十分清楚了，连他自己的老婆都出来作证，就再 不可抵赖了。
这里，请读者按捺片刻，容我把我国法律的英明睿智公公道道地赞美 一下一一它拒绝接受妻子所作的证言，不论对丈夫有利还是不利。一位学 识渊博的作者说（我记得，除了一本法律书外，他的话从来没有人引用 过），倘若允许妻子作证的话，那就会在夫妻之间酿成无尽无休的纠纷， 也一定会弄出许多伪证，从而使许多人被鞭笞、罚款、囚禁、流放和处以 绞刑。
巴特里奇站在那儿沉默了一阵子，等吩咐他说话时，他才说：一切实 情都已经讲了，并且说，老天知道他是清白无辜的。最后又说，那个女仆 本人也是知道的。他不晓得（或者至少是装作不晓得）珍妮早已离开这一 带了，他要求老爷马上把她传来作证。
奥尔华绥先生办事素来喜欢公道，又加上性情冷静，这就使他成为一 个一向极有耐性的法官，肯于听取被告为了替自己辩护而提出的一切证人 的证词。他立刻派人去找珍妮，在她来到之前，他同意对这个案子暂不作 最后判决。然后他又劝巴特里奇夫妇要和和睦睦的（可惜他这番劝导大都 说给那个不需要劝导的人听了），并且指定他们第三天再来候审，因为他 打发珍妮去的地方离他家刚好是一整天的路程。
在指定的时日，有关各方都到齐，听候审理。这时，派去传珍妮的人 回来了，说找不到她，因为前几天她已经离开住所，跟一个招募新兵的军 官走了。
于是，奥尔华绥先生宣布：这个珍妮看来只不过是个下贱女人，她作 的证言似乎也不足为凭。不过他还说，巴特里奇自己的招认以及他老婆供 出当场捉奸的许多情节，已经足以证明确有其事了；倘若珍妮能到庭并且 讲出真话，也只能进一步证实而已。因此，他再一次劝巴特里奇要坦白招 认。可是巴特里奇仍然坚持自己是清白无辜的。奥尔华绥先生说，他本人 对巴特里奇的罪名已没有疑问了，并且声明他决不能去鼓励这种坏人。因 此，他取消了那笔年金，劝他为了来世而真心悔改，为了养活他自己和老 婆，在现世要辛勤劳动。
世上比可怜的巴特里奇更倒霉的人恐怕为数不多了。由于老婆的证 言，他失掉了大部分进项，可还得天天听她责难：除了其他许多方面，失 掉那笔进项也是祸由他起。然而他的命运就是如此，他只能逆来顺受。
尽管我在上文里称他为可怜的巴特里奇，可是我宁愿读者把我使用这 个形容词归之于我生来心肠软，而不可理解为宣告他清白无辜。他究竟清 白不清白，下文大概自见分晓。倘若历史缪斯近把什么机密交我保守，那么 在没得到她的许可之前，我是决不会犯泄密罪的。
因此，请读者暂时抑制一下好奇心。不论这件事是虚是实，可以确言 的是摆在奥尔华绥面前的证据蛮够他判罪的了。如果是旁的法官的话，证 据比这再少许多也尽够确定巴特里奇通奸生子的罪名的。但是尽管巴特里 奇太太一口咬定，甚至愿意为这件事对天起誓，然而塾师完全无辜还是有 可能的。固然把珍妮离开小巴丁顿与她分娩的时间计算一下，娃娃显然是 在那儿怀的胎，然而那并不就等于证实巴特里奇准是孩子的爸爸。旁的不 提，当时家里还有个将近十八岁的小伙子，他跟珍妮来往相当亲密，理应 引起疑窦。但是人一吃起醋来就盲目了，巴特里奇的老婆在盛怒之下，一 次也没有想到这一点。
巴特里奇究竟有没有遵照奥尔华绥先生的劝告去悔罪，这倒不很明 显；可是他老婆却着实大为后悔不该去作不利于自己丈夫的见证，尤其是 她事后发现德波拉大娘完全骗了她，在奥尔华绥先生面前一句求情的话也 不肯替她说。不过，她在布利非太太那里似乎还顺利。读者谅必理会到那 位太太脾气要温和得多，她慨然答应去替她求情，要她哥哥恢复他们那笔 年金。她这样做固然是由于她心地好，然而她另外也还有个更强烈、更合 乎人情的动机，下一章自见分晓。
但是布利非太太求情却没有成功。尽管奥尔华绥先生并不像晚近某些 作家那样认为讲仁慈无非就是惩罚有罪者，然而他同样也不认为毫无理由 地任意赦免犯有严重罪过的人就符合这一美德。案情上遇有任何疑点或可 以减刑的情节，他一概都不放过；可是犯罪者的请求或旁人的求情却丝毫 不能影响他。总之，他决不因犯罪者本人或其朋友不愿意罪犯受到惩罚， 就加以赦免。
这样，巴特里奇和他的妻子就只好俯首听从命运的安排。这份命运确 实很苦：进项减少了，他不但没加倍努力，发奋图强，可以说是反而由于 绝望而颓唐下来。巴特里奇生性本就懒散，如今这个毛病更加严重了，他 那小私塾终于也关门大吉。要不是一位好心的基督教徒出于恻隐之心，接 济他们一些糊口之资，两口子非挨饿不可。
这种接济来自一位无名氏。他们认为这位隐名匿姓的施主就是奥尔华 绥先生本人，我相信读者也一定这么想。奥尔华绥先生虽然不肯公开去鼓 励罪恶，可是倘若罪人遭受的困苦大得跟他所犯的罪过不相称时，他也可 以暗地里为之减轻。如今在命运女神的心目中，巴特里奇一家的悲惨处境 正是如此。她终于同情起这对可怜虫，把巴特里奇太太的苦难完全结束， 从而也就大大减少了她丈夫的苦难一一原来不久她就患天花去世了。
奥尔华绥先生对巴特里奇作出的判决，最初博得人们一致的赞同。及 至巴特里奇刚一吃到判决所招致的苦头，邻居们的心立刻软了下来，开始 同情起他的境况，随后就责怪起他们以前所称许过的公道，认为那太严峻 苛刻了。这时，他们大声疾呼，反对无情地执行处罚，极力歌颂仁慈和宽 恕。
巴特里奇太太的去世使这种呼声更加高涨了。尽管她的死是由于患了 上述疾病，而这病并非贫困或忧伤所引起的，可是许多人却仍然厚着脸皮 说她是死于奥尔华绥先生的执法过严一一或者用他们当前的说法，就是惨 无人道。
巴特里奇丧失了老婆、私塾和年金，而今那位无名氏又把前边提到过 的救济金停掉了，眼看就要挨饿。于是，他决定迁移，在四邻的一致同情 下，离开了这里。
第七章
一幅简短的素描，说明深谋远虐的夫妇从相互憎恨中可以得到怎样 的家庭幸福一一顺便替那些姑息朋友缺点的人申辩几句
尽管大尉害得可怜的巴特里奇家破人亡，可是他并没收到自己预期的 效果：把弃儿从奥尔华绥先生的家里赶出去。
相反地，那位乡绅倒一天比一天更加喜欢起小汤米来了，仿佛要用对 儿子的百般爱抚来弥补对他父亲的苛刻似的。
正如奥尔华绥先生平日间的其他一切善举一样，这使大尉十分恼火， 因为在他心目中，所有这些施舍都等于是破费他自己的财产。
我们前边已经提过，在这个问题上大尉和他太太的意见并不一致。老 实说，在任何问题上他们的意见都是相左的。虽然有许多聪明人认为建立 在才识上的爱情比建立在美貌上的要牢靠，然而在他们身上则恰恰相反。 才识刚好是他们夫妻不和的主要原因，也是引起他们不断争吵的一个重要 来由。终于闹到妻子这一方对丈夫是无比地鄙夷，而丈夫对妻子则是由衷 地厌恶。
他们两个人的才华主要都发挥在对神学的研究上。从最初相识的时候 起，这也正是他们最常交谈的话题。婚前，大尉总像个有教养的人那样放 弃自己的见解，处处迁就女方。而且他采取的方式也决不像个自负的傻瓜 那么蠢，在争论时一方面彬彬有礼地向地位高于自己的人让步，一方面却 还要对方了解他仍然认为自己有道理。大尉则不然。尽管他是世上最倨傲 的人之一，他却把全部胜利毫无保留地让给对方，使得那位对他的诚意毫 不怀疑的小姐在每次结束争论回屋去时，都大为赞赏自己的才识，同时对 他的才识也更加爱慕。
虽然大尉对自己满心看不起的人这么恭维，还没有像为了飞黄腾达而 不得不向赫德理丝或神学界旁的大师去奉承那样难堪，可是如果他不是别有 所图，连这一点他也无论如何不甘心忍受。因此，一旦结了婚，没有什么 可贪图的了，他也就不耐烦再那么卑躬屈节了。他开始用傲慢无礼的态度 来对待他老婆的见解一一这种态度是只有那些应受鄙夷的人才拿得出，也 只有那些不应受鄙夷的人才忍受得了的。
开头那段恩爱的热潮过去之后，在情感的风暴与风暴之间总有一段漫 长的风平浪静时刻。这时，理智开始打开了夫人的眼睛，她看到大尉态度
上的改变。闹到后来，大尉对她发表的一些论点甚至只报之以"呸"、"咄”之 声。她决不肯伏伏帖帖地忍受这种侮辱。老实说，最初她气得几乎演出一 场悲剧。幸亏她采取了一种比较温和的方式来发泄，就是把她丈夫的才识 也看成一文不值，这样以略微减轻她对丈夫的憎恨一一不过她这种憎恨也 够强烈的了。
大尉对她的憎恨要单纯一些。他倒不因为她在学识见解方面的缺陷而 藐视她，正如他不会为了她身高不及六叭而藐视她一样。他对女人的看法 比亚里士多德来得还要乖戾，他把女人看作一种家畜，比猫略高一等，因 为她们担负的职务要更重要一些。然而这两者之间的差别在他心目中实在 微乎其微，以致当他跟奥尔华绥先生的房屋地产缔结婚姻时，不管饶上只 猫还是饶上一位白丽洁小姐，在他看来是没有多大区别的。可是他的自尊 心很强，他已觉察出妻子近来对他的鄙视。加之他早已对她的爱情感到腻 味了，于是他就对白丽洁产生了一种恐怕是无与伦比的厌弃与憎恶。
夫妻关系中，有一种情况是决无乐趣可言的，那就是彼此冷冷淡淡， 不关痛痒。如果许多读者已经晓得让自己所爱的人快乐是怎样一桩乐事 （但愿如此），那么我想也有些人一定曾体会到折磨自己所恨的人又是多 么痛快。夫妻婚后即使双方都很不称心，本来仍可以享受一份恬静的家庭 生活；但我想，往往就是为了图这后一种痛快，于是弄得彼此不能相安。 这时做妻子的就忽而狂爱一阵，忽而吃一阵醋，为了搅得丈夫不安，不让 他享受一点点快乐，甚至不惜牺牲自己的一切快乐。丈夫出于报复，也勉 强耐着性子呆在家里，陪着他所不喜欢的妻子，这样逼着妻子整天跟她也 同样讨厌的丈夫守在一起。想必也是由于这个缘故，经常有些寡妇在丈夫 生前一直和他吵个不休，不让他有片刻安宁；可是等丈夫死后，无法再折 磨他时，又朝着丈夫的骨灰嚎啕痛哭。
倘若世上曾有夫妻享受过这样的乐趣，当前，大尉和他的妻子就正在 体验它。两人中间，只要一个曾发表过什么意见，另一方就有充足的理由 坚决反对。如果一方提议点什么娱乐，另一方总是不赞成。他们从来不会 喜欢或憎恶、褒奖或责备同一个人。因此，由于大尉把小弃儿看成眼中 钉，他的妻子就开始把他疼得跟自己亲生的孩子一般。
读者不难想象到，大尉夫妻之间这种情况自然不会怎么增进奥尔华绥 先生的安宁。他本来蛮想这桩亲事可以为他们三个人建立起一种恬静的幸 福生活，结果却事与愿违。但是，虽然他这番热望有些落了空，他还远远
没有了解到事实的真相。大尉固然由于某种显而易见的原因，在奥尔华绥 跟前谨小慎微，避免露出马脚；他夫人也生怕惹得哥哥不悦，只好采取同 样的态度。老实说，一个第三者跟一对颇为谨慎的夫妻即使非常接近，甚 至长年同住在一所房子里，也很可能察觉不出他们之间的不睦：因为尽管 把整天的时间拿来相憎或是相爱有时还会嫌不够，然而对于稍能克制的一 对夫妻来说，在没有局外人在场的情况下，他们很自然地单独在一起度过 的许多钟头就已尽够他们发泄自己的感情了：相爱的，也无需乎当着旁人 搂搂抱抱，相恨的，也不至于在人前还对唾面孔。
然而奥尔华绥先生也可能已经看出一些使他不大放心的迹象。我们总 不能因为一个聪明人不曾孩子气或女人气地叹息流涕，就断定他没有伤心 事。但也可能尽管他已经看出大尉的某些缺点，却丝毫没感到不安；因为 真正明达善良的人，不论对人对事，总是按照其本来面目予以接受，对其 缺点，从不抱怨，也不硬去矫正。即使在朋友、亲戚或熟人身上察觉到某 种过失，他们也从不对本人或旁人提起，并且往往并不因此而在感情上同 他们疏远。老实说，深刻的辨别力若没有宽宏大量的风度来调节，我们就 只能跟那些有几分傻气，可以被我们所蒙骗的人去交朋友。希望我的朋友 们恕我直言不讳，在我认识的人中间就没有一个是毫无缺点的；同时，如 果我的朋友中间竟然有人看不到我身上存在的缺点，我也一定引以为憾。 我们对人宽厚，也要求旁人对我们宽厚。这就是友谊的表露，而且也许还 是非常愉快的表露。我们对人这样表示宽厚时，还不能存心去矫正旁人。 世上也许没有比企图去矫正我们所爱慕的人的天生缺陷更显得愚蠢的了。 最完美的人有如最精致的瓷器，也可能会有些瑕疵。这两种瑕疵恐怕都是 无可补救的；但是尽管如此，它们也许仍然属于最可贵的类型。
总的来说，奥尔华绥先生一定也在大尉身上发现了一些缺点，然而大 尉为人诡计多端，在他面前时刻提防着，因此，他只把那些缺点看作优良 品质上的瑕疵。奥尔华绥先生的仁厚使他对人包涵，他的智慧又阻止他向 大尉明白指出来。倘使他发觉全部事实，他的心情自然也会大大不同了； 而且要是大尉夫妇彼此之间这种状况长久保持下去，他迟早也会发现的。 但是仁慈的命运女神采取有效措施，防止了这一点。她逼着大尉干了一桩 事，这下子使他重新得到妻子的爱情，完全恢复了她旧日对他的种种柔情 蜜意。
第八章
-个重获妻子欢心的秘方，不管情况多么绝望，也能药到病除
大尉一个人想心思的时候总是十分愉快的，这就大大弥补了他和夫人 交谈的那几分钟（他总是尽量把这种时刻缩短）的不愉快。
他的心思全都用在奥尔华绥先生的产业上了。他先花费不少脑筋尽量 估计了一下全部家当确实值多少钱。他时常发现有必要把这种估价修改得 对自己更有利些。然后，也是最主要的，是在脑子里盘算着该对房舍花园 做哪些改建，和其他种种修缮方案，以便使这座庄园更加富丽堂皇。这样 盘算时，他总感到十分开心。为此，他孜孜钻研建筑学和园艺学，读了很 多这方面的书。这种研究确实占据了他的全部时间，成为他唯一的消遣。 他终于完成了一套精美完备的设计，可惜我们无力把它介绍给读者，因为 我相信连今天的豪华气概也无法和它匹敌。所有使这种伟大而高贵的设计 生色的两大要素，它都+足具备了。要实现这样一套设计，需要一笔大得 惊人的款子，而且即使粗具规模，也需要很长一段时间。关于钱，大尉相 信奥尔华绥先生有的是，而且肯定将由他来继承，准能如数提供。至于时 间，他体质健壮，又刚入中年，自信一定可以活到大功告成的那一天。
现在诸事齐备，只等奥尔华绥先生一死，他这个计划立刻就可以付诸 实施了。为了计算奥尔华绥先生哪一天一命呜呼，他大大运用了他的代数 学，并且把坊间一切有关估算人寿以及遗产继承等等的书籍，全都买到 手。根据这些，他得出这样一个使自己满意的结论：既然奥尔华绥先生每 天都有死亡的可能，那么他多半会在几年之内死掉。
可是，有一天正当大尉聚精会神在思索这类问题的时候，一桩极不幸 又极不合时宜的意外在他身上发生了。老实说，不管命运女神怎样恶毒， 她也难得想出这么残酷、这么不凑巧、这么毫不留情的手段来摧残大尉的 一切如意算盘。为了省得读者东猜西想，干脆说吧：正当大尉那颗心冥想 着奥尔华绥先生的死亡会带给他多么大幸福而欢跳不已的时候，他自己却 猝然中风死了。
不幸的是，大尉是在傍晚独自散步时遭到不测的，因而纵使他还救得 活的话，当场也没人来救护。于是，他就量出了足够他此后使用的那么大 一块土地，倒在上面死了。这是说明贺拉斯那句名言的真实性的一个伟大 （虽不是活生生的）例证：
Tu secanda marmora
Locas sub ipsum funus ； et sepulchri
Immemor, struis domos.[27]
下面我把它的大意传达给英国读者："你准备下最珍贵的材料，要大兴土 木；其实，一把鸭嘴锄和一把铁锹就尽够了。你盖起长五百叭、宽一百叭 的巨厦，却忘记你所需要的只不过是六叭长、二叭宽那么大一块地方。”
第九章
从寡妇的悲痛足以证明上述秘方万无一失;还有一些与死有关的其 他适当的点缀，诸如医生等等；并附一篇标准的墓志铭
奥尔华绥先生和他妹妹以及一位女客到了平素用晚餐的时刻，就都来 到饭厅。他们等了好一会儿，比往常等的时间要长多了，还不见大尉到 来。奥尔华绥先生首先表示大尉这半天还不见来，他很不放心一一因为大 尉用饭向来总是极守时刻的。他吩咐到户外去摇铃，特别朝着大尉常散步 的那些地方摇。
可是任凭怎么召唤，也是徒然，因为真是不巧，大尉那天傍晚刚好换 了一条路径。布利非太太说，她实在很担心。另一位妇女是布利非太太极 要好的朋友之一，她非常清楚布利非太太真正的心思，就极力劝她平静下 来。她说，您当然不能不挂虑，可是事情总应该朝好的方面想。说不定暮 色太可爱了，把大尉吸引住，使他比平常走远了一些；要不就是哪家街坊 把他留住了。布利非太太说，不会的，她相信准是发生了什么意外，不然 他绝不会不给她捎个信就呆在外面的，因为他晓得这会叫她多么着急。那 位女客想不出什么话来争辩了，就讲了几句在这类场合通常讲的话，劝她 不要担心，免得伤了她自己的身子。然后又为她满满斟上一杯酒劝她喝， 并且终于怂恿她饮了下去。
奥尔华绥先生曾亲自出去寻找过大尉。这时他回到饭厅，神色间充分 表露出他十分惊慌，他几乎连话也说不出来了。悲哀在各人心里会引起不 同的反应，同样的忧虑压低了奥尔华绥先生的声调，却抬高了布利非太太 的嗓门。如今她嚎啕痛哭起来，一边怨天恨地，一边泪如雨注。那位女伴 说，哭倒也怪不得她，只是劝她不要哭得太厉害了。她试图用哲学上的道 理来节制朋友的悲哀，说天有不测风云，人有旦夕祸福；说正因为这样， 我们才必须坚强起来，不测的事不论来得多么突兀，多么可怕，都要经受 得起。她劝布利非太太学学她哥哥的坚忍榜样。尽管他不会有她本人那么 着急，可是毫无疑问他也是很不放心的。然而由于他懂得乐天知命，所以 才不至于悲伤过度。
"别提我哥哥，"布利非太太说，"只有我是值得你同情的。遇到这种情 况，出于友谊的恐慌怎能跟做妻子的比呢！啊，他完啦。有人把他谋害了 ――我再也见不到他啦！"说到这儿，眼泪又如骤雨般落了下来。这眼泪在
她身上产生的效果和克制力在奥尔华绥先生身上产生的效果是同样的一一 她安静下来了。
就在这当儿，一个仆人飞跑进来，喘着气嚷道："找到大尉啦。"没等 他说下去，就又进来两个人，抬着大尉的尸体。
关于悲伤在各人身上所引起的不同的反应，好奇的读者可以看到又一 例证。同样是悲伤，奥尔华绥先生刚才一声不响，而他妹妹却哭天喊地； 如今，望到这情景，奥尔华绥先生不禁潸然泪下，布利非太太却流不出眼 泪来了。她先是猛然惊呼一声，随后就昏倒过去。
屋子里立刻挤满了仆人，有的跟那位女客一道照应大尉的妻子，有的 帮奥尔华绥先生把大尉抬到一张暖榻上，用尽一切方法来挽救他的生命。
倘使我们能告诉读者，对两个失去知觉的人所进行的抢救都很见效， 那我们当然会很高兴。照看布利非太太的人获得了很大的成功，她昏厥了 相当一段时间，就苏醒过来了，大家都十分满意。可是大尉则不然。所有 放血、按摩和滴药等等法子全试过了，都不奏效。尽管同时请来两位医生 来充当他的辩护士，并且立即致送了酬金，可是死亡这位说一不二的法官 还是把他判决了，并且不许缓刑。
为了避免有人恶意地引用两位医生的大名，我们姑且称他们作甲大夫 和乙大夫。他们先试过脉--那就是说，甲大夫试右脉，乙大夫试左脉，
然后两位一致同意大尉已经断了气。至于害的是什么病，或者致死的原 因，两位却各有各的看法。甲大夫认为大尉是中风而死的，乙大夫则断定 他死于癫痫。
于是，两位渊博的学者之间就展开了一场争论，各自提出若干论据来 支持自己的诊断，双方的论据又同样确凿有力，越争论就越各自坚持本人 的看法，丝毫也不能影响对方。
老实说，每位医生几乎都有他所偏爱的病症，并且总是把死亡取得的 一切胜利统统归之于自己所偏爱的那个症候。风痛症、风湿病、结石、尿 砂和肺痨等症在医学界都各有垂青者，其中，照顾神经炎或精神症的更大 有人在。由此可以说明对于一个患者的死因何以意见纷纭，连医学界最有 学问的人士也会这样，使得那些不了解上述底细的人大惑不解。
读者也许会感到奇怪，何以两位医学大师来到之后，不先去抢救患者 的生命，却立刻在他的死因这个题目上争论起来呢？实际上，在他们还没
来之前，各式各样的办法都已经试过了：大尉被抬到暖榻上，脉管乱扎 过，额头按摩过，嘴唇和鼻孔里都滴了各种烈性药酒。
两位医生发现他们吩咐人做的事，人家都早已做过了；而按照习惯和 礼貌，看在诊金面上也得耽搁一会儿才能走。他们不知如何消磨这段光 阴，就只好找点题目来扯扯。既然如此，还有什么话题比上边这个来得更 自然呢？
两位医生刚要告辞，这当儿，奥尔华绥先生接受了天命，放弃了救活 大尉的希望，转过来问起他妹妹怎么样了，并且请两位医生给她治治再 走。
夫人这时神志已经恢复过来了一一照通常的说法，就是恢复到在目前 状况下她所能恢复的程度。由于这是位新病人，两位医生把事先的一切手 续办完之后，就遵照奥尔华绥先生的请求替她诊治。他们就像刚才对待那 具尸体一样，每人抓起她一只手来。
夫人和她丈夫的情况恰恰相反；她丈夫是任何医药都无能为力了，而 她呢，其实任何医药也不需要。
人们通常总认为医生是死神的伙伴，再没有比这种看法更不公平的 了。相反地，倘若把被医术救活的跟殉身于医术的人数比较一下，我相信 前者还是要超过后者。有些医生在这方面十分谨慎。为了生怕万一把病人 治死，他们宁可放弃一切治疗办法，只开一些不痛不痒的药。我听说这类 医生当中还有人作为座右铭一本正经地这么说："病人应任凭自然去摆布， 医生只能袖手旁观；自然如果干得好，医生就拍拍它的肩膀，以示鼓励。”
两位医生对死亡都很不感兴趣，所以只收了一次诊金就把尸体丢开了 事。可是对于活着的病人，他们却并不那么讨厌。两位医生关于她的病状 马上取得了一致的意见，然后就十分卖力气地开起药方来。
布利非太太一开头就使两位医生相信她有病，至于他们究竟是否又反 过来让她相信她自己确实有了病，这一点我就不去断言了。然而整整一个 月，凡是病人应有的点缀她全都有了：这时期有医生们来为她诊病，有护 士们来服侍，又不断有亲友们捎口信来问候她的病情。
终于病该好、悲痛也该结束的时候到了，夫人就把医生们打发掉，又 应酬起亲友来了。跟以前相比，她唯一的改变是在装束和神态上罩了一层 悲伤的色彩。
这时，大尉已经安葬了。倘若不是奥尔华绥先生看重友谊，在他的坟 上立了一座石碑作为纪念，大尉也许已经快被人忘干净了。碑文是一位才 气横溢、天性淳厚并且熟知大尉的人执笔的，全文如下：

第三卷
汤米-琼斯十四岁至十九岁之间奥尔 华绥先生家中所发生的重要富情； 读者可由本卷得到一些有关
儿童教育的启发
第一章
几乎没有或者完全没有什么内容
读者想来还记得，在本书第二卷一开头，我们曾表示：倘若在有些较 长的阶段里并没发生什么值得这类历史一记的事情，我们就打算省略过去 了。
这样做，我们不但考虑到自己的身份和方便，并且还照顾到读者的好 处和便利，因为这个办法除了免得读者去看既乏味又无益的文章，白白糟 蹋时间之外，还可以给他一个机会来发挥他所特有的那种惊人的智慧，用 他自己的臆测去填补这些空白。因此，我们在上文里曾着意为他准备下必 要的线索。
譬如说，读者谁不知道奥尔华绥先生刚刚丧友时的那种悲痛心情？除 了铁石心肠或木头脑袋的人，谁遭到这种不幸也会那么伤心的。再说，哪 位读者不知道日久天长，哲理和宗教都会冲淡这种悲伤，终于使之消灭。 哲理教导我们悲伤是愚蠢而无益的；宗教一方面告诫我们悲伤是错误的， 同时又安慰我们，给我们以对未来的希望和保证，使得坚强而虔诚的人在 朋友床畔送终的时候，就像送朋友出趟远门那样泰然自若，而且事实上也 正像对远行的友人那样希望还能聚首重逢。
关于白丽洁•布利非太太的情况，贤明的读者也不难揣度。大家可以放 心，在整个居丧期间，举凡孀妇应恪守的一切礼数规矩，她一样也不短 缺。她的面部表情密切配合着一次次服装的更换：她的服装从丧服换成黑 色，从黑色又换成灰色，再从灰色换成白色。她的面容也从凄惨变成悲 戚，从悲戚变成哀伤，再从哀伤变为肃穆。终于，她可以恢复以往那种宁 静安详的一天来到了。
我们提到这两点，只是作为能够向程度最低的读者提出的课题的例 证。至于那些在批评方面修养更高的读者，我们不妨要求他们更加深刻、 更加勤勉地运用他们的判断和洞察力。毫无疑问，在我们认为理应略过去 的这段岁月里，明察秋毫的读者不难从这位可敬的乡绅家里所发生的事情 当中，得到许多重大发现。尽管这期间没有什么值得本书一记的，可是确 实也发生过几桩与目前日报、周刊登载的新闻同样重要的事情一一许许多 多人耗费不少时光去读那类新闻，却得不到什么好处。读者从事我在这里 所提议的那种臆测时，头脑里某些精湛功能也许会大大获益，因为在任何
情况下，能够从人物的性格揣度其行动的本事，总比能够从人物的行动判 断其性格要有用得多；前者固然需要更精辟透彻的洞察力，然而真正聪明 的人会同样有把握做到。
正因为我们深知读者大都充分具备了这种能力，所以才留出这段十二 年的空白供大家去运用。现在，就让已经十四岁左右的主人公登场吧，因 为毫无疑问，好些读者早就等得不耐烦了。
第二章
这部伟大历史的主人公登场时候兆头很不吉利;这里有件无聊琐 事，也许有人认为不值得去理会。关于一位乡绅的二三言，然后再 细说一个看猎场的和一位教书先生
从一开始坐下来写这部历史，我们就拿定主意，谁也不去奉承，笔尖 要永远跟着真理走；所以在主人公登场的时候，我们只能让他的境遇比我 们所希望的要不利得多。老实说，在他初次露面的时候，奥尔华绥先生一 家一致认为这孩子来到世间无非是为了上绞刑架的。
遗憾的是，这种推测确实似乎颇有道理。从很小的时候，这孩子就露 出种种为非作歹的倾向，特别有一种倾向看来极有可能把他径直引上方才 所提到的人家为他算定的那种厄运。他已经犯过三次盗窃案：偷过人家果 园的果子；从庄稼人院子里偷过一只鸭子；并且还从布利非少爷的口袋里 扒过一只皮球。
而且，要是跟他的同伴布利非少爷的优良品质一比较，这个小伙子的 劣迹就更显得严重了。布利非少爷的性格跟小琼斯完全不同。不但家里人 夸奖，就是左邻右舍也交口称赞。说起来他真是个气质非凡的孩子，既稳 重，又懂得分寸，而且虔诚得简直不是他那点年纪的人所能做到的。这些 品质使得认识他的人没有不爱他的，而汤姆•琼斯则是个万人嫌。好些人纳 闷何以奥尔华绥先生会让这么个孩子和他的外甥在一块儿受教育，生怕他 外甥给带坏了。
这当儿发生了一件事，在有眼力的读者面前把这两个少年的性格衬托 得格外鲜明，远胜过最冗长的谈论所能做到的。
尽管汤姆•琼斯这么没出息，他还得充当本书的主人公。家里那么多用 人，可是他偏只跟一个人要好。至于威尔根斯大娘，她早就把他撇在一 边，跟女主人完全和解了。汤姆这个朋友就是给奥尔华绥先生看猎场的一 个不大规矩的家伙。人家说他对于什么是我的，什么是你的，看得并不比 那位小绅士认真。所以他们俩的交情就在用人中间引起不少冷言冷语，说 的大半是过去的一些谚语，或至少如今已经变成谚语了。这些话里所包含 的机智大可以用那句简短的拉丁谚语来概括：“Noscitur a socio”，翻译 出来就是："睹其友而知其人。”
关于琼斯的劣迹，上面已经举过三个例子。老实说，某些坏事很可能 就是在那家伙的撺掇之下干出来的。在两三件事上看猎场的都是法律上所 谓的同谋犯，因为那整只鸭子和大部分苹果都归他和他的家人享用了。不 过，既然只有琼斯一人被抓住了，这可怜的孩子不但独自挨了打，也独自 承当了罪名。另外那件事，打骂也全落在他的头上。
紧挨着奥尔华绥先生田产的是另外一位乡绅的庄园，这类乡绅是个通 常所谓的"猎物保护人"：倘若有人打死他们一只野兔或鹧鸪，他们报复起 来十分狠毒，因此，这种人可以说跟印度拜尼教[1]徒崇尚同样的迷信一一据 说许多拜尼教徒一辈子不干别的，专门保存并且保护某些动物。所不同的 是：我们英国的拜尼教徒一方面保护动物，不让它们落到旁人手里，同时 自己却毫不留情地把它们整批宰杀；因此，也就没有人能说他们信奉了什 么异教邪说。
老实说，我对这类绅士的看法要比某些人好多了。我认为他们是替天 行道，比其他许多人更能充分地完成天赋的使命。贺拉斯告诉我们世上有 一种人：
Fruges consumere nati, [2]
生来就是为消受地上的果实的。
所以我相信世界上还有一种人:
Feras consumere nati,
生来就是为消受旷野里的走兽的。
走兽指的就是通常所谓的野味。我相信没有人能否认这班乡绅确能完 成造物赋与他们的这个使命。
有一天，小琼斯跟那个看猎场的出去打猎。他们碰巧在一座庄园的边 界附近惊起一群鹧鸪。命运女神为了实现造物的英明意图，就把一个上文 所说的那种专门消受野味的乡绅安置在这里。那群鹧鸪飞进了他的地界，
落在离奥尔华绥先生的庄园大约二三百步的金雀花丛里，被两个猎人"瞄准 了"。
奥尔华绥先生曾经吩咐过看猎场的，不论这家庄园的地界，还是对行 猎这类事儿不那么计较的邻人的地界，一概都绝对不许他侵入；如敢故 违，立即开除。其实，看猎场的在对待旁的邻人的地界上，并没经常严格 遵守这道命令；但是眼下这群鹧鸪飞过去避难的那座庄园的主人的脾气是 人所共知的，所以看猎场的过去一直也没敢侵入他的地界。他现在也还是 不敢。怎奈那位小猎人一心想追赶逃掉了的猎物，再三怂恿。琼斯坚决不 肯罢休，看猎场的也颇急于猎取，就依从下来，闯进庄园，打死一只鹧 鸪。
这时候，那位乡绅正好骑在马上，离他们不远。听见枪声，他立刻催 马过来，当场抓住倒霉的汤姆一一看猎场的已经窜进金雀花丛枝叶深处， 侥幸地躲藏起来了。
那乡绅在孩子身上搜出鹧鸪，狠狠咒骂，口口声声要加以报复，发誓 非告诉奥尔华绥先生不可。他说到办到，果然一径骑马到奥尔华绥先生家 里，抱怨他的庄园受到侵害，其气势之凶，措词之强硬，听来仿佛他家遭 了明火打劫，抢走了最贵重的家具。他说，这孩子还有个同伙没有抓到， 因为差不多在同时，他听到了两声枪响。他还说："我们只搜出这只鹧鸪， 天晓得他们还干了些什么坏事呢！”
汤姆回家之后，奥尔华绥先生马上把他叫到跟前。汤姆承认确有这么 回事，只分辩说，那群鹧鸪原是从奥尔华绥先生的庄园里飞过去的一一这 确是实情。
于是，奥尔华绥先生追问琼斯跟他在一起的那个人究竟是谁，他告诉 这罪犯，那位乡绅和两个用人已经证明当时放的是两枪，他非查出另外那 人不可。但是汤姆一口咬定就只他自己一个人。不过老实说，开头他也略 微犹豫了一下，如果乡绅和他的用人的话还需要点旁证的话，汤姆这么一 犹豫也就更足以使奥尔华绥先生相信事实确是这样。
既然看猎场的是个嫌疑犯，这时就被叫来，问他这件事有没有他的份 儿。可是他拿稳了汤姆答应独自担当下来的诺言，坚决否认曾经跟小少爷 在一起过，甚至说整个下午根本没见到他。
奥尔华绥先生带着平素罕见的怒容，朝汤姆掉过头来，要他老实招出 那个伙伴；一再说，不把那个人追查出来他决不甘休。可是孩子仍旧不动
摇，奥尔华绥先生非常生气，叫他回去好好考虑，明天早晨另有人会用另 外种办法来审他。
那一晚，可怜的琼斯心里好生忧郁，尤其因为他平素的伴侣布利非少 爷跟他母亲出门做客去了，他一个人更加闷闷不乐。当前他担心的倒不是 第二天将受的惩罚，他顶怕的是自己坚持不下来，把看猎场的招了出去。 那么一来，他知道看猎场的准会完蛋。
那一晚，看猎场的也不好过。他跟琼斯一样也担着心思：他顶关心的 倒不是那孩子皮肉将受的痛苦，而是他能不能守住信义。
第二天早晨汤姆去见牧师屠瓦孔先生，奥尔华绥先生把两个孩子的教 育都委托给他了。这位塾师把奥尔华绥先生头天问过的那几句话照样问了 一遍，汤姆也照样回答了一遍，结果是挨了一顿毒打，其凶狠与某些国家 逼供时用的酷刑不相上下。
汤姆抵死受刑，坚不改口。尽管那位老师抽一鞭子就问他一下招不招 认，可是他宁愿给打得皮开肉绽，也不肯背信弃义，出卖朋友。
这时候看猎场的才放了心，可是奥尔华绥先生看到汤姆给打得这么 苦，却心疼起来。屠瓦孔先生从这孩子口里逼不出他所希望的口供来，心 头火起，用刑过狠，竟远远超出这位好人的本意。除此之外，奥尔华绥先 生还开始怀疑那位乡绅会不会弄错了一一在他那样情急盛怒之下，这也是 很可能的。至于两个用人替他们的主人作的见证，他并不怎么重视。待人 残酷和冤枉好人这两件事，奥尔华绥先生心里是一刻也不能容忍的，所以 他把汤姆叫到跟前来，先用好言好语训诫了一番，然后说："好孩子，我相 信我冤枉了你，害你受了一场严厉的责罚，心里很过意不去。"最后就赠给 汤姆一匹小马，作为弥补，并且又说了一遍他为先前这件事多么难过的 话。
这时，汤姆倒感到了内疚，这是任何严厉的责罚所办不到的。对他来 说，屠瓦孔先生的鞭子比奥尔华绥先生的仁厚要容易忍受多了。他泪如泉 涌，跪倒在地，叫道："您老人家待我太好啦，真是太好啦，我实在不 配！"说的时候一阵激动，几乎吐出实情；幸亏那看猎场的守护神在暗中指 点，提醒他倘若说了实话，那个可怜的家伙会有怎样的下场。由于考虑到 这一点，汤姆才缄默下来。
屠瓦孔极力劝奥尔华绥先生不要可怜孩子，以致对他有任何仁慈的表 示。他说："这孩子怎么也不肯说实话，"口气之间表示，再揍他一顿，大
概就可以把案情弄个水落石出了。
但是奥尔华绥先生决不同意他再试用这个办法。他说，即便孩子撒了 谎，为了隐瞒实情他也吃够苦头了；况且他撒谎至多也只是出于对信义了 解不当罢了。
"什么信义！"屠瓦孔先生带几分怒气嚷道，"只不过是倔强、固执罢 啦！难道信义会教人去撒谎？难道离开了宗教还能谈得上信义？ ”
这段话是在刚吃完午饭的时候说的，席间除了奥尔华绥先生和屠瓦孔 先生之外，还有一位先生也参加了这场争论，我们现在先把这位先生简单 介绍一下，然后再继续讲下去。
第三章
哲学家斯奎尔先生和神学家屠瓦孔先生的性格;以及他们进行的一 场关于……的争论
这位先生名叫斯奎尔，他在奥尔华绥先生家里已经住了些日子。他的 天分算不得是头等的，不过由于受过高深的教育，倒也大大弥补上了。他 博览古书，自称对柏拉图和亚里士多德的著作部部精通。他立身治学主要 就以这两位大师为楷模，时而遵循前者的见解，时而又以后者的主张为依 归。在道德方面他自称是柏拉图派，可是在宗教上他又倾向于亚里士多德 的学说。
虽然我们刚才说他在道德方面是以柏拉图为楷模，可是他又完全同意 亚里士多德的看法，认为那位大师是哲学家或思想家，而不是立法者。这 个意见他确能笃信、力行，甚至把一切德行都看作只是理论问题。固然， 我没听他对任何人这样说过，可是只要稍稍留意一下他的举止，就不能不 认为这是他真正的想法。这样认为，倒能够完全调和不然的话就会在他的 性格上出现的一些矛盾。
这位先生几乎跟屠瓦孔先生一见面就非争辩不可，因为两个人的观点 完全相反。斯奎尔认为人类的本性就具备一切崇高的德行，犯罪是违背了 本性，正如奇形怪状不是人体的本来面目一样。屠瓦孔的看法恰恰相反。 他认为自从亚当犯罪以来，人的心灵就成为罪恶的渊薮，必须仰赖神的恩 宠才能得到洗涤和拯救。他们的见解只在一点上是一致的：在讨论道德的 时候，两人都绝口不提“善"字。斯奎尔三句话不离"生来具有的德行之 美"，屠瓦孔则总把"神恩的威力"挂在嘴上。前者用不可变更的是非法则和 事物永恒的适当性来衡量所有的行为，后者则要依靠权威来判断一切事 物。他总是援引《圣经》及各家对它的注释，一如律师引用柯克注释的李 特尔顿的著作一样，其注释与正文具有同样的权威。[3]
看了这段简单的介绍之后，请读者不要忘记牧师最后还得意洋洋地提 出一个他认为无人能回答的问题：离开宗教，难道还谈得上什么信义吗？
斯奎尔回答说，如果不先把名词的含义明确下来，那是无法从哲学上 进行讨论的，而且，简直再也没有比对方所提的这两个名词的意义更含 糊、空泛的了。因为对"信义"一词，不下于对"宗教"一词，理解上有种种 分歧。他对屠瓦孔先生说："假使你说'信义'是指生来具有的德行之美，那
么我认为它可以脱离一切宗教而独立存在。"他又补充一句："甚至你自己 也会承认，除了你所信的那个宗教之外，信义可以脱离任何其他宗教而独 立存在；那么回教徒也好，犹太教徒也好，世界上信奉其他教派的人也都 会有你这样的看法。”
屠瓦孔反驳说，这是正统教会的敌人一向怀着恶意所唱的论调。他毫 不怀疑，世上不信上帝的人和异教徒，如果办得到的话，一定极愿意把"信 义”的含义局限于他们自己的荒谬的错误和可诅咒的骗局里。"可是我们不 能因为人们对信义有各种愚蠢的看法，于是就说有各式各样的信义。也不 能因为世界上有各式各样的教派和异端邪说，就承认有各式各样的宗教。 我所谓的宗教乃是基督教；不仅是基督教，而且专指新教；不仅是新教， 而且专指英国的国教。我所谓的信义乃是神恩的一种形式，它不但与这种 宗教一致，还以它为依归;而且决不和任何其他宗教一致，或以之为依 归。倘若有人认为我在这里所说的信义（我想那就是我对信义的全部看 法）会赞成，更不用说会唆使一个人去撒谎，那简直是荒谬得不堪设想 了。”
"我有意不去作出结论，"斯奎尔说，"其实，根据我所说的话，结论已 经很清楚了。假使你已经明白了我的结论，那我肯定你就不会试图作出回 答了。也罢，咱们姑且撇开宗教不谈，我觉得从你的话里，分明可以看出 咱们俩对'信义'各有各的看法，不然的话，同一个字眼，何以会得出不同的 解释来呢？我曾经说过，真正的信义和真正的德行意思几乎相同，它们都 是建立在不可变更的正义法则和事物永恒的适当性上，而撒谎是和这二者 绝对抵触、互不相容的。毫无疑问，真正的信义当然不能支持撒谎。所以 在这一点上，我想咱们的看法是一致的。倘若宗教是指成文法律而言，那 么信义是宗教的前提，却又可以说是建立在宗教上的……”
"难道我的意见会跟把信义看成宗教的前提的人一致！"屠瓦孔气冲冲 地说，"请问，奥尔华绥先生，我可曾赞成过……”
他正要往下说，奥尔华绥先生插嘴拦住，非常冷淡地告诉他们，两个 人都误会了他的本意，他并没讲真正的信义。要不是另外一件事情结束了 眼前这段谈话，也许奥尔华绥先生还不容易劝住这两位已同样十分激动的 辩论家呢。
第四章
作者做一点必要的辩解;另外还有孩子们之间的一件事，或许也需 要辩解
在我往下叙述之前，请允许我先解释几句，免得少数读者由于热心而 发生误会；因为我不愿意得罪任何读者，尤其那些殷切关怀道德或宗教事 业的人。
因此，我希望不要有人大大误会或曲解我的意思，错认为我是有意嘲 笑人性中尽善尽美的品质。我相信完全是由于这种品质的存在才使人的心 灵纯洁而高尚，把人类提到高于牲畜的地位。读者诸君，我敢说（你们越 是好人，就越会倾向于相信我这话）：我宁愿把斯奎尔和屠瓦孔两位先生 的意见永远埋没掉，也不愿意损害道德或宗教的光荣事业。
恰恰相反，正是为了要发扬道德、宣传宗教，我才把这两个冒充道德 及宗教的捍卫者的生平事迹记载下来。背信弃义的朋友是最险恶的敌人。 我敢说，伪君子给宗教和道德带来的真正的损害远甚于最狡黠的浪荡汉或 不信教的人。不仅如此，纯正的道德和宗教可以名副其实地叫作文明社会 的纲纪，确实是上天赐于人的最大的恩惠，但如果为诡诈、虚伪和矫揉造 作所毒化、败坏，那它们就会变成社会上最大的祸害，使人对自己的同胞 做出穷凶极恶的事。
我相信这种对伪君子的嘲笑一般是允许的。我所担心的主要是，许多 真实、公正的见解也常出自这些人之嘴，从而读者也许会把一切都混淆起 来，认为我不分青红皂白一律加以嘲笑。请读者仔细想一想：既然这两位 先生都不是傻子，不能设想他们抱的一切见解全是错误的，他们发表的言 论全是荒谬的。因此，倘若我专挑他们的坏处来写，那岂不十分冤屈了他 们，使他们的论点显得支离破碎，荒谬不堪了。
总而言之，这里所揭露的不是道德或宗教，而是道德及宗教信仰的缺 乏。要不是在建立各自的体系时，屠瓦孔过于轻视道德，斯奎尔过于轻视 宗教，要不是他们二人都把善良的天性忘得一干二净，他们就不会在书中 被描绘成为嘲笑的目标了。下面我们言归正传。
前一章里，我们提到两位塾师的争论被一件事打断了，说的正是布利 非少爷和汤姆,琼斯吵了一架，结果布利非少爷给打得鼻破血流。布利非少
爷虽然岁数小，个子可比汤姆大；不过在高雅的拳术上他却远不是汤姆的 对手。
然而汤姆总是极力小心，避免跟布利非动手，因为尽管汤姆•琼斯很顽 皮，他却从不加害于人，而且他真心爱护布利非。此外，屠瓦孔先生总袒 护布利非，这也足以使他有所顾忌。
可是某位作家曾经说过："人总难免一时糊涂。"一个小孩子偶尔鲁莽 一下更是不足为奇。两个孩子在玩什么游戏的时候发生了争执，布利非少 爷开口骂汤姆是"讨饭的野种"。汤姆的脾气本来就有些暴躁，一听这话，马 上就在小少爷脸上留下了前边交代过的那个痕迹。
布利非少爷的鼻子鲜血直淌，眼泪也紧跟着滚滚而下，来到他舅父和 那位声色俱厉的屠瓦孔跟前告状，当堂控诉汤姆犯了殴打致伤罪。汤姆在 辩解时，只说自己是因为被激怒才动手的，而这正是布利非少爷的诉状里 唯一漏掉的一点。
也许布利非少爷真可能把这段情节给忘了，因为在答辩的时候，他一 口咬定没用这个字眼儿骂过汤姆，并且还说："上帝在上，那样下流的字眼 儿绝不会从我嘴里吐出来！”
汤姆不遵守法律程序，又发了言，指出布利非确实说了那句话。于 是，布利非少爷说道："这也难怪。撒过一次谎的人再撒一次，自然不当回 事。要是我像你那样在老师面前撒过那么卑鄙的一个谎，我会羞得没脸见 人了。”
"孩子，什么谎？”屠瓦孔热切地追问。
"他不是告诉过您，鹧鸪是他一个人开枪打死的，当时没有旁人跟他一 道去打猎吗？可是他自己心里明白……"说到这里，他放声大哭起来。"是 的，他自己心里明白，他亲口向我透露过看猎场的黑乔治也在场。他还说 ――你是这么说的，有本事你就抵赖好了。你还说，就是老师把你剁成肉 酱，你也绝不招出实情。”
屠瓦孔听了这话，眼里立刻冒起怒火来，洋洋得意地嚷道："哦，这就 是所谓了解偏了的信义吗？这就是再也不许鞭打的老实孩子吗？"可是奥尔 华绥先生的神情却温和得多。他转过脸来问这小伙子："孩子，这话可当 真？那天你怎么死也不肯说实话？ ”
汤姆回答说，他跟旁人一样厌恶撒谎的行为，可是他觉得当时为了守 信，只能那么说，因为他已经答应过那个可怜的人替他隐瞒。汤姆还说，
本来看猎场的央求他不要闯进那位乡绅的地界，可是经他自己再三怂恿， 看猎场的才勉强跟了过去，因此，他更加认为应该替他隐瞒。他说，他愿 意发誓，说的句句都是实话。最后，他苦苦哀求奥尔华绥先生怜悯那人的 老婆孩子，尤其因为错在他自己一个人，看猎场的本不愿意跟过去，他好 容易才把他说动的。他说："您老人家想想，其实我上次的话也不能算是撒 谎，因为在这件事情上，那个可怜的人完全是无辜的。我本来会一个人去 追鹧鸪的一一起初，我也确实是一个人去的，他跟过来只不过是怕我闹出 更大的乱子。请您老人家罚我吧，收回您赏给我的那匹小马，可是无论如 何请您饶恕可怜的乔治。”
奥尔华绥先生沉吟了一刻，然后吩咐两个孩子退下去，嘱咐他们以后 在一起要和和气气的，不准再吵嘴打架。
第五章
神学家和哲学家对两个孩子的看法;他们这种看法的若干根据，以 及其他事情
这件事当初汤姆是作为一个重大秘密透露给布利非少爷的，如今，被 他揭发出来，也许倒让汤姆免了一顿毒打。因为光为打破鼻子这桩事，屠 瓦孔先生本来蛮可以动手责罚他的，可是如今只顾研讨撒谎问题，却把打 架的事抛在脑后了。奥尔华绥先生背着孩子说，他认为汤姆在撒谎这件事 上应受的是奖赏，而不是处罚。在这种大赦之下，屠瓦孔这才不得不把手 缩了回去。
屠瓦孔心目中只有鞭子，他竭力反对这种优柔寡断的（或者照他说， 是不道德的）宽大。他说，不去惩罚这种罪恶就是助长这种罪恶。他还发 挥了一通关于管教孩子的道理，引用了所罗门四以及旁的人的许多话一一这 些话既然在其他许多书里都可以查到，这里就省略了。接着他又大谈起何 以撒谎是罪恶的道理，在这个问题上，他的学问跟管教孩子的问题同样渊 博。
斯奎尔说，他曾竭力想把汤姆这个行为跟自己对完美德行的概念调和 起来，可是办不到。他也承认那孩子的行为看来像是有着坚忍不拔的地 方，然而坚忍是美德，撒谎是罪恶，这二者是水火不相容的。他还说，既 然在一定程度上这是把道德和罪恶混淆起来了，这似乎就更值得屠瓦孔先 生考虑，责罚是否更应加重一些。
既然两位学者在惩戒琼斯的问题上意见一致，在夸奖布利非的问题上 自然也不谋而合。牧师坚持说，揭示真理乃是每个笃信宗教者的责任；哲 学家则断言，这也十分符合正义的法则和事物永恒的适当性。
可是这些论调全说不动奥尔华绥先生，他不肯签发拘票，处治琼斯。 这个孩子对伙伴始终不渝的忠实远比屠瓦孔的宗教或斯奎尔的道德更能引 起他的共鸣。因此，他断然叮嘱屠瓦孔不得为这次的事情责打琼斯。塾师 只好遵命，可是很不甘心。他嘟嚷说，这孩子一定会给惯坏的。
奥尔华绥先生对待看猎场的要严峻多了。他立刻把那个倒霉的家伙叫 到跟前，狠狠地申斥了一通，然后算清了工钱，把他辞退。奥尔华绥先生 说得很对：为了替自己开脱而撒谎，和为了袒护旁人而撒谎，这中间有很 大区别。他说他对这个家伙所以这么毫不容情，是因为他卑鄙地让汤姆•琼
斯代他受过，受到重罚；他原该自己招认，那样，汤姆也就不至于吃这个 苦头了。
这事情传出去之后，许多人都不同意屠瓦孔和斯奎尔对这两个孩子的 行为的看法。他们都骂布利非是个鬼鬼祟祟的坏蛋，一个没出息的痞子， 以及其他类似的称号；另一方面却夸奖汤姆是个勇敢的小伙子，性格爽 快，为人诚实。汤姆庇护黑乔治的举动使他博得了宅里所有用人们的好 感。尽管大家以前讨厌黑乔治，然而他刚一被撵走，人人倒都可怜起他来 了。汤姆•琼斯的友谊和义气受到大家极大的赞扬，对布利非少爷则在不至 于冒犯他母亲的情形下，尽量公开地加以贬斥。尽管大家夸奖汤姆，他的 皮肉却被打得生疼，因为屠瓦孔虽然被禁止为上述那件事再操练他的手 臂，可是俗语说得好："有心打人，不难找到棍子。"他当然也不难找到教 鞭。一旦把教鞭抓到手，谁也不能老拦住屠瓦孔，不让他去责打琼斯。
倘若促使这位塾师打孩子的只是一种单纯的癖好，那么布利非少爷也 很可能挨上几下。可是尽管奥尔华绥先生一再嘱咐他对这两个孩子不许有 偏心，然而屠瓦孔总是对布利非既慈祥又和善，对琼斯则不但粗暴，甚至 蛮横。老实说，布利非所以那么得老师的宠爱，固然因为他一向对老师表 示出深切的尊崇，更要紧的是由于他在接受教诲时候那种毕恭毕敬的态 度。他把老师的话都背了下来，时常挂在口上。小小年纪竟以惊人的热忱 恪守老师所讲的宗教教义。难怪这位可敬的教师对他这么宠爱。
汤姆•琼斯恰恰相反。他不但在礼貌上有欠周到，老师走过来时他还总 是忘记脱帽鞠躬，而且把老师的教诲和做出的榜样一概不放在心上。他确 实是个轻率、浮躁的少年，举止随便，嬉皮笑脸，时常肆无忌惮地嘲笑他 的学伴那副道貌岸然的神态。
斯奎尔先生也因为同样的原因而偏爱布利非。这位先生虽然有时候也 在汤姆•琼斯身上破费一些功夫，为他讲点高深的道理，可是这孩子也像对 待屠瓦孔的教诲一样，全不放在心上。有一次他甚至拿正义的法则开起玩 笑来。又有一回，他说不相信世界上有什么法则能创造出像他父亲（奥尔 华绥先生让汤姆这么称呼他）那样的人。
布利非少爷则不然。虽然他才十六岁，却有本领在两位水火不相容的 先生之间两面讨好。见了这一位，他是满口宗教；见了那一位，他就满口 道德。倘若两位都在座，他就一言不发。这样，双方都以为他赞成自己的 意见，都十分喜欢他。
布利非当面奉承这两位先生还嫌不够，他时常找机会背着他们在奥尔 华绥先生跟前说他们的好话。每当只有他们甥舅两人在一起的时候，倘若 舅父夸奖起布利非在宗教或道德上的见地（他经常发表种种意见），布利 非总是分别归功于屠瓦孔或斯奎尔教导有方。他明知道舅舅一定会把这些 恭维话转告给他们，而这也正中他的下怀。他从经验中发现，哲学家和神 学家听了那些话，心里都好不受用。老实说，这种辗转传来的恭维，谁听 了也没法不感到悦耳。
而且这位小绅士不久就看出奥尔华绥先生本人听了他对两位老师这番 颂赞，也颇称心，因为这又等于赞美了舅父自己独出心裁制订下的教育计 划。这位可敬的乡绅看到我们公立学校制度的缺陷和孩子们在学校里容易 沾染的种种恶习，就决定把他的外甥和那个实际上已经成为他的养子的汤 姆留在家里教育，认为这样孩子们在道德上就不至于受到腐蚀了，而在公 立学校或是大学里，这是难以避免的。
奥尔华绥先生决定给孩子们延师教读之后，就有一位挚友举荐屠瓦孔 先生担任这个教职。奥尔华绥先生素来很佩服这位朋友的见识，相信他为 人诚恳真挚。屠瓦孔这个人原是某大学的研究员，他一直住在学院里。大 家都称赞他学问好，笃信宗教，举止稳重。那位朋友当然是根据这些条件 向奥尔华绥先生推荐的。不过屠瓦孔一家是当地极有势力的人物，而奥尔 华绥先生的那位朋友是他那个区选出来的国会议员，他欠着屠瓦孔家一些 情分。
屠瓦孔初来的时候，奥尔华绥先生对他非常满意，他也确乎完全符合 那位友人的推荐。可是相处得久了，交往得亲密了，乡绅逐渐在塾师身上 看到他所不愿意看到的一些缺点。然而屠瓦孔的种种优点似乎远远盖过了 他的缺点，所以奥尔华绥先生也就不想把他辞退；而且那些缺点又确乎不 曾达到非采取这种措施不可的程度。读者如果以为奥尔华绥先生眼里的屠 瓦孔跟我们在这部书里所看到的是一个样子，那他就大错特错了；倘若读 者以为要是他亲自和这位神学家朝夕相处，就能发现我们凭着灵感而揭示 出的那些隐秘，他同样也是大错特错了。如果有些读者根据这种自负心情 遽然就责备起奥尔华绥先生见识浅陋，缺乏知人之明，那么我就要老实不 客气地说：他们滥用了我们透露给他们的底细，这就辜负了我们的一番好 意。
屠瓦孔在学说上的那些显著的错误大大缓和了斯奎尔在学说上偏到另 —极端的错误一一这些，奥尔华绥先生也看得十分清楚，并且也十分不以 为然。他确实认为这两位先生一方的偏颇正可以用来矫正对方的缺点，在 这两位教师的教导下，尤其是再加上他从旁协助，两个孩子对于正统的宗 教和道德总可以得到充分的教益。倘若结果与他所预期的正好相反，那也 可能是由于这套教育计划本身存在着什么缺点一一这方面读者如能有所发 现，就尽可以去发现，因为我们并不想让毫无缺陷的人物在这部书里出 现，我们也希望这里所描绘的一切，没有一件不是人之常情。
现在回到本题：我想读者看了上文也就不会再奇怪为什么两个孩子不 同的态度会引起不同的反响一一例子已经举了几桩。此外，我们还有个理 由足以说明哲学家和那位塾师对待两个孩子的态度何以有所不同。不过， 这是一件十分重要的事，我们要留到下一章再叙述。
A-A- I -r^r-
第六章
为上述论点提出更有力的理由
应该让大家知道，在我们这部历史的舞台上最近大为活跃的两位学 者，自从进了奥尔华绥先生的家内那天起，就十分敬爱奥尔华绥先生；一 个敬重他的道德，另一个则爱戴他信教虔诚，两个人心里都盘算着和乡绅 结为亲戚。
因此，他们两人都看上了那位美貌的寡妇一一尽管我们好久没提到她 了，我相信读者也不会把她忘掉。布利非太太正是他们一致梦寐以求的目 标。
说也奇怪：在我们提过的四个到奥尔华绥先生家来住过的男人当中， 倒有三个爱上了这位一向不曾以美貌见称，如今在年龄方面又开始走下坡 路的女人。不过，事实上知心朋友自然而然地就会爱上朋友家的某些女 眷，不管她是对方的祖母、母亲、姊妹、女儿、姑姨、侄甥女、表姊妹， 只要她们手里有钱；也不管她是朋友的妻子、姊妹、女儿、侄甥女、表姊 妹，还是管家婆或女用人，只要她们长得漂亮。
可是读者不要以为像屠瓦孔和斯奎尔这种性格的人，会不经过仔细考 虑这是不是（借用莎士比亚的话来说）"良心的问题"％轻易就干出谨严的 道学家曾略加谴责的事情来。屠瓦孔所以敢于做这件事，是因为他想到 《圣经》上从没说过不许垂涎邻人的姊妹，而他晓得对一切法律的解释， 应以Expressum facit cessare tacitum[6]为原则 这句话的意思就 是："立法者一旦把他的全部意旨明确规定下来，我们就不能再任意去解释 了。"既然《圣经》里规定不得贪图邻人的财物，而说到女眷时并没提姊 妹，因此，屠瓦孔认为在别人的姊妹身上打主意是合法的。至于斯奎尔， 他本来就是个风流男子，是个专会讨寡妇欢喜的人物，因此，他不难使他 追求布利非太太这件事符合事物永恒的适当性。
既然两位先生无孔不入地竭力在寡妇面前讨好，他们就都看出一道不 二法内，那就是处处偏向她的儿子，老叫汤姆吃弓。又由于他们猜想奥尔 华绥先生那么疼爱汤姆一定会使她很不高兴，估计抓住机会就糟蹋这孩子 准能深深赢得她的欢心；因为既然她恨汤姆，那么就一定会喜欢一切欺负 汤姆的人。在这一着上，屠瓦孔可占了上风：斯奎尔只能诋毁汤姆的名 声，而屠瓦孔却能鞭打他的皮肉。老实说，他每打一鞭子，就觉得是向那
位寡妇献了一点殷勤。这样，他就能十分得体地引用那句关于鞭打人的老 话：Castigo te non quod odio habeam, sed quod Amem。“打你不 是出于恨，而是出于爱。"实际上，这句话他时常挂在嘴边上一一或者像一 句再恰当不过的古老谚语所说的，挂在他的指尖上。
这两位先生对两个孩子的看法主要就是由于这个缘故而一致起来的。 他们两人恐怕也只有在这一点上意见一致，因为除了主张不同，他们俩还 老早就深深地疑心对方也在打寡妇的主意，因而彼此怀着强烈的憎恨。
这种相互间的忌恨又由于他们常常轮流获胜而越发加深。早在他们产 生这个念头之前，布利非太太就猜透了（或者力求猜透）他们的心事。他 们进行得十分谨慎，唯恐惹恼了她，她会去告诉奥尔华绥先生。其实，他 们大可以不必担心，她倒很喜欢他们那番热情，并且拿定主意要独自享受 其果实一一她要享受的只不过是他们献的殷勤和表示的爱慕。所以她轮流 敷衍他们，长时期都是不分厚薄，平等对待。其实，她更喜欢牧师所讲的 教义，然而斯奎尔的相貌却又更合她的心意。他长得很俊秀，而那位塾师 的长相实在颇有些像《荡妇历程》中正管教着教养所女囚的那位先生。
布利非太太究竟是吃腻了结婚生活的蜜糖，还是尝够了结婚生活的苦 果，或是别有隐衷，我不便断言；不过，她无论如何也不肯考虑再嫁了。 可是她和斯奎尔的交往终于变得非常亲昵，爱嚼舌头的人就在她背后说三 道四起来。那些话不但有损寡妇的名声，也与正义的法则以及事物永恒的 适当性十分悖谬，我们不予置信，因此，也就不去糟蹋笔墨了。至于那位 塾师，尽管他使勤鞭打汤姆，仍没能离目标更近一步。
屠瓦孔确实犯了个很大的错误，斯奎尔比他发现得早多了。布利非太 太对她丈夫的所作所为并不怎么满意（这一点读者也许以前就料到了）。 干脆说老实话，她简直恨透了他。她丈夫去世后，她才稍稍恢复了一些对 他的感情。因此，如果她并不把跟他生下的孩子当作心肝宝贝，那也不是 什么十分奇怪的事情。事实上，她对自己亲生的这个儿子漠不关心，他还 在襁褓中时，她就很少去看他，从不把他放在心上；因而，她开头虽然还 有点勉强，但过不久就同意了奥尔华绥先生对弃儿的种种宠爱一一这位好 心人把汤姆叫作自己的儿子，待他样样都跟布利非少爷一视同仁。四邻和 家里人都把布利非太太的这种同意看作是对她哥哥的迁就。大家（其中包 括屠瓦孔和斯奎尔）都认为她心里一定憎恨那个弃儿。她待汤姆越好，他 们越认为她恨他，以为她在布置更周密的圈套，好陷害他。既然他们认定
她为了自己的利益非恨汤姆不可，她也就非常难以使他们相信事实并非如 此。
屠瓦孔更是这么认为，因为布利非太太曾经不止一次乘奥尔华绥先生 不在家的当儿，暗中撺掇他去责打汤姆•琼斯一一奥尔华绥先生是最反对打 孩子的。可是她从来也没吩咐过他去打布利非少爷。在这一点上，连斯奎 尔也上了她的当。实际上，虽然她确实恨她那个亲生的儿子一一不论这显 得多么荒唐，我相信她并不是唯一的例子。尽管表面上她对哥哥是百依百 顺的，看来她对奥尔华绥先生那么宠爱汤姆，心里却很不乐意。她时常为 这件事背着她哥哥发牢骚，还在屠瓦孔和斯奎尔面前狠狠指摘过他。每逢 兄妹吵嘴一一或者像俗语说的"闹小别扭”的时候，她还为这件事当面顶撞 过奥尔华绥先生。
可是汤姆年龄渐大，表现出女人们特别喜欢的那种殷勤豪爽的性格。 于是，他小时候布利非太太对他的厌恶也逐渐减少。最后，她索性露骨地 表示出她爱汤姆远过于她亲生的儿子。这时候，也就不容人们对她的心意 再有所误会了。她渴望常见到他，每逢有汤姆在身边的时候，她总显得那 么心满意足。这样，汤姆还不上十八岁，就已经成了屠瓦孔和斯奎尔的勤 敌了。更糟的是，四邻又议论说，她对汤姆有意，说得跟过去他们议论她 对斯奎尔有意时一样响亮。为了这桩事，哲学家对我们这位可怜的主人公 积下了深仇大恨。
第七章
作者在本章中亲自登场
尽管奥尔华绥先生并不轻易从坏的方面看事物，而且他也没听到早已 传遍左邻右舍、但是很少传到做哥哥或者丈夫耳朵里去的那种风言风语， 可是布利非太太这么喜欢汤姆，这么露骨地偏爱他而冷淡自己的儿子，反 而对汤姆极其不利。
奥尔华绥先生是如此富于恻隐之心，只有在惩治恶行时，他才能克制 一下。不论谁，要是并非罪有应得而遭到不幸，就足以使这位好心人对他 很同情，并且获得他的友谊和惠助。
所以他一看出小布利非显然为他母亲所厌恶（事实确是如此），单凭 这一点，他就同情起这个孩子来。至于同情会在心地慈祥的善人身上产生 什么效果，对大多数读者说来，这是无需讲明的。
从那以后，奥尔华绥先生总是用放大镜来看那个少年的每一优点，用 缩小的镜头去看他的一切缺点。这样一来，缺点就几乎看不到了。单是这 样，也许还值得称赞他心肠软；可是底下一步就只能用人类天生的弱点来 开脱了，因为他一看出布利非太太对汤姆的偏向，她越喜欢汤姆，他就越 对那个可怜的孩子（不管他是多么无辜）冷淡起来。自然，仅仅为这件事 还不至于叫奥尔华绥先生从此心上就没有了琼斯，可是这总归让这孩子吃 了大亏。奥尔华绥先生脑子里先留下了这样的印象，为本书后面要叙述的 一连串重大事件打下了底子。同时，我们也应该承认，这个倒霉的孩子的 荒唐、胡闹，有失检点，也大大促成了那些事件的发生。
将来读此书的心地纯良的青少年，倘能正确地理解我们所记载的这些 事例，那会对他们大有裨益。他们从中可以看到仁慈的心肠和爽朗的性格 固然可以给人很大的安慰，从而感到心安理得，只可惜在处世做人上没有 多大帮助。再善良不过的人，也离不开小心谨慎四个字。它们是道德的保 护者，没有它们，道德就毫无保障。你单是居心好，行为好，这是不够 的，还得叫别人看来也觉得好才成。不管你的内心多么美好，你还必须保 持一个漂亮的外表。这一点得时刻注意，否则妒忌你的坏人就会乘机往你 脸上抹黑，使得连奥尔华绥先生那样明达、忠厚的人也不能识破别人的诽 谤，洞察你内在的美。年轻的读者，请记取这段话作为你们的座右铭：多 么善良的人也不能忽视谨慎之道。道德如果不是用端庄恭谨来装扮，就显
不出它的美来。贤明的弟子，倘若你们仔细读下去，就会找到足够的例子 来证明我这话不假。
请恕我以合唱队［刀的身份在舞台上出现了一会儿。我这样做实际上也是 为了替自己表白，因为当我指出纯洁、善良的人经常也会触着的那些礁石 的时候，我是想告诉他们当心那样一来就会身败名裂；可不要误会我是在 引导可敬的读者去触礁。这些话我又没法叫任何一位演员替我说，只好自 己来向大家交代。
第八章
一桩孩子干的事情，然而可以看出汤姆•琼斯的仁厚，国肠
读者也许还记得那次奥尔华绥先生以为汤姆•琼斯无辜受了惩罚，所以 给了他一匹小马作为补偿的事。
这匹马汤姆养了半年多，然后把它骑到附近一个集市上卖了。
回得家来，屠瓦孔追问他卖马的钱哪里去了，他老实回答说，不愿告 诉他。
"哦，不愿意告诉我！ ”屠瓦孔说，"那么我就非从你屁股上问出来不 可。"每遇到什么疑问，他总是向这块地方寻求解答。
汤姆已经被放到一个用人的背上，一切准备停当，正要动刑的当儿， 奥尔华绥先生走进屋来，吩咐先缓一下刑。他把汤姆带到另一间房里去。 这时身边没人，就向汤姆问起刚才屠瓦孔提出的那个问题。
汤姆说，无论老人家问什么，他都应该一五一+地回答出来。至于那 个蛮横无理的浑蛋，他只能用棍子回答他一一他希望不久就能用棍子来回 敬他的一切残暴行为。
奥尔华绥先生听到孩子说出这样对老师无礼的话，就严厉申斥了他一 顿，尤其责备他不该存心报复。奥尔华绥先生吓唬他说，假若再从他嘴里 听到一句这种话，就要和他割断恩情，因为他决不愿意抚养、疼爱一个无 赖。用这样一类的话，他迫使琼斯作了悔过的表示。然而在这一点上孩子 并不怎么诚恳，因为他确实想好好报答一下从老师手里领受到的一切夏楚 之恩。不过，奥尔华绥先生的申斥终于使他表示不该对屠瓦孔怀恨在心。 奥尔华绥先生晓以大义之后，就让他接着说下去：
"我比世上任何人都更敬爱您，我也知道您待我恩深义重。倘使设想我 竟然会对您忘恩负义，我自己都会憎恶自己。您送给我的那匹小马要是能 说话的话，它一定会告诉您我是多么珍爱您这个礼物，因为我喜欢喂它， 不大舍得骑它。老实说，卖掉它，我心里难过极了。如果不是为了那件 事，我是无论如何也不肯把它卖掉的。您倘若处在我的地位，我相信您也 会那么做的，因为没有人赶得上您这样同情别人的不幸。倘若您想到别人 的灾难都是自己造成的，心里该是怎么个滋味？老实说，世界上再也找不 出像他们那么可怜的了一一”
"孩子，像谁那么可怜？”奥尔华绥说，"你说的是什么呀？"
"啊，您老人家不知道，"汤姆回答说，"自从您把那可怜的看猎场的开 除以后，他那一大家子人挨饿受冻，快要活不下去了。我不忍看到他们饿 着肚子，光着身子，而同时明知他们这一切灾难都是我自己造成的。我实 在不忍，真是万分地不忍。"说到这里，他脸上淌下两行热泪。接着又 说："我是为了搭救他们一家人的性命，才把您那件宝贵的礼物卖掉的，尽 管我非常珍爱它。我是为他们卖的马，所有的钱都给了他们，我自己一文 也没留。”
奥尔华绥先生听完这话，默默地在那里呆了一会儿，还没开口，就忍 不住流下泪来。最后，他轻轻地责备了汤姆几句，嘱咐他以后再看到别人 有困难还是来找他，不要自己去想些独出心裁的办法来救济。说完，就打 发他走了。
后来，这件事成为屠瓦孔和斯奎尔之间争辩不休的题目。屠瓦孔断定 汤姆这样做是公然违抗奥尔华绥先生，因为奥尔华绥先生原本是为了那个 汉子不听话才辞退他的。他还说，照他看来，在某些事情上实行一般所谓 的仁慈是与上帝的意旨背道而驰的，因为上帝就注定了某些人要遭毁灭； 同时，汤姆这样做，也违背了奥尔华绥先生的意思。他的结论和往常一 样，还是对打屁股一举大为推崇。
斯奎尔的意见则恰恰相反。也许他是为了反对屠瓦孔的看法，要不就 是为了附和奥尔华绥先生一一看来奥尔华绥先生对汤姆卖马救人这件事是 十分赞成的。至于他讲了些什么话，这里叙述起来倒显得多嘴了，因为我 深信绝大多数读者都能够替可怜的琼斯充当更高明的辩护人。老实说，把 这样一桩不可能出自非正义法则的行为，跟斯奎尔先生的正义的法则调和 起来，并不是什么困难的事。
第九章
一件更为有罪的事情，以及屠瓦孔和斯奎尔对它的评论
一位远比我更以聪明著称的人曾说过：祸不单行。我相信那些干了许 多坏事，不幸终于露出马脚的先生们就是个例子，因为一旦在一件事上败 露，不把全部情况弄个水落石出，人家是不会罢休的。倒霉的汤姆正是如 此。他卖马的罪过刚刚得到宽恕，不久以前他曾把奥尔华绥先生送给他的 —部精装本《圣经》卖掉，卖的钱也都用来接济看猎场家的事又暴露出来 了。这部《圣经》的买主正是布利非少爷，尽管他自己已经有了一部同样 的；他这样做一半是出于对这本书的尊重，一半也是出于对汤姆的友谊， 不愿意他半价卖给外人。因此，他就自己按半价买了下来。布利非是个+ 分精明的孩子，银钱上头最仔细不过。奥尔华绥先生给他的钱，他几乎分 文不花，全都存了起来。
有些人只有自己的书才读得下去，布利非少爷则恰恰相反。自从把汤 姆这部《圣经》买到手，他就光使用这一部，而且他读的次数也比以前读 他自己的那部时勤得多。由于他不断请屠瓦孔替他解释疑难的地方，说也 倒霉，屠瓦孔就发现了书里许多地方都写着汤姆的名字。老师追问根由， 布利非少爷只好把实情和盘托出。
屠瓦孔认为卖《圣经》是亵渎神明，决不可恕，立刻就动手打了汤姆 一顿。这还不算，见到奥尔华绥先生他还把这件他认为罪大恶极的事报告 给他，用最恶毒的话咒骂汤姆，把他比作从圣殿里被赶出去的买卖人［8］。
斯奎尔却大不以为然。他说他看不出卖某一本书为什么就要比卖另一 本书罪加一等。不论按照神的还是人的法律，出卖《圣经》都是完全合法 的，因此，这件事并无不妥之处。他告诉屠瓦孔说，对这件事这么小题大 做，不禁使他想起一个故事：从前有个虔诚的女人，纯粹出于热心宗教， 她竟从一位相熟的太太那里偷了一部《提罗逊讲道集》［9］。
牧师一听这个故事，本来就不苍白的脸越发涨得通红。他气冲冲地正 要发作，在场的布利非太太却插嘴说，她完全赞成斯奎尔的看法。她引经 据典地支持他的见解，最后说，倘若汤姆有任何罪过，她的儿子也一样有 罪过，因为她看不出买主与卖主之间有什么区别，还不同样该赶出圣殿！
布利非太太表示了她的看法之后，辩论就结束了。斯奎尔即使还想说 什么，因为已占了上风也就无须说了。屠瓦孔气得要死，可是由于前面提
过的原因，也不敢违拗布利非太太的意思。至于奥尔华绥先生，他说既然 已经罚了孩子，眼下他就不再说什么了一一究竟他生没生汤姆的气，这一 点就让读者去揣摩吧。
过后不久，乡绅魏斯顿（汤姆就是在他的庄园里射死鹧鸪的）把看猎 场的告下来了，罪名是重犯盗窃罪。对看猎场的来说，这是极为不幸的 事，因为这不但会弄得他身败名裂，而且也使得奥尔华绥先生无法重新录 用他了。有一天奥尔华绥先生带着两个孩子去散步，小琼斯不声不响地把 他引到黑乔治家里。这样，他就看到黑乔治的老婆孩子挨饿受冻，衣不蔽 体，景况万分凄惨。至于汤姆接济他们的钱，几乎全都用来还了旧债。
这副景象不由得叫奥尔华绥先生心里难过起来。他马上给了那个做母 亲的两个基尼也，嘱咐她赶紧给孩子买点衣服穿上。那女人被这片好心感动 得流了泪。她向奥尔华绥先生道谢的时候，不禁也说了许多感激汤姆的 话，说倘若没有汤姆的搭救，他们一家人早就饿死了。"要不是多亏他的好 心周济，我们已经连一口面包也没得吃，这些可怜的孩子连点破烂也穿不 上啦。"的确，为了接济这家苦人，除了那匹小马和那本《圣经》，汤姆还 卖掉他的睡衣和一些旁的东西。
归途，汤姆尽量施展他的口才来陈述这家人的境遇有多么悲惨，黑乔 治对自己的罪过有多么悔恨，终于说动了奥尔华绥先生。他表示乔治为了 以往的过失已经吃够苦头了，他决定饶恕乔治，设法让他能养家糊口。
琼斯听了这话非常高兴，到家时虽然天已经黑了，他还是冒着大雨跑 回看猎场的家里，把这个喜讯告诉给那个可怜的女人。可是正像其他过早 走漏消息的人一样，他这是自找麻烦，事后还得去否认，因为黑乔治噩运 当头，就在他的朋友走开的当儿，情势又有了逆转。
第十章
布利非少爷和琼斯大相径庭
论起仁慈这种可爱的品德，布利非少爷远远不及他的同伴；然而论起 那更为崇高的品德，即公道来，他又大大超过了他。在这方面，他完全遵 循屠瓦孔和斯奎尔的教训和榜样。尽管他们两位口头上时常挂着"仁慈”二 字，然而实际上斯奎尔认为仁慈与他的正义的法则不相容，屠瓦孔则一味 赞扬主持公道而把仁慈留给上帝。只是在究竟应该对谁执行这种崇高的道 德方面，这两位先生的意见确实不大一致。为了公道，屠瓦孔可能认为人 类有一半应该毁灭掉，斯奎尔却认为应该被毁灭的是另外的一半。
布利非少爷当着琼斯的面虽然没说什么，可是后来仔细一思量，就无 论如何也不甘心让他舅舅把好处给不配受惠的人。因此，他决定把前面我 们略微提过的那件事，报告给奥尔华绥先生，事情的真相是这样的：
看猎场的被奥尔华绥先生辞退以后大约一年光景，也就是汤姆卖马之 前那段时间里，一家子饿着肚皮，急于找点什么充饥。有一天他从魏斯顿 先生的一块地里穿过，瞧见一只野兔蹲在窝里。他就卑鄙而野蛮地照它的 脑袋敲了一下，这不但违背了土地法规，也违背了有关狩猎的条例以。
这只兔子卖给了一个小贩。过了几个月，不幸这个小贩正背着许多猎 物时让人抓住。他不得不检举一两个偷猎的人，以求得那位乡绅的宽恕。 他挑上了黑乔治，一则因为魏斯顿先生对黑乔治早有恶感，二则也由于黑 乔治素日在这一带的名声也不怎么好。更加上，自从卖兔以后，黑乔治再 也没向他出售过什么猎物。因此，牺牲黑乔治以保全那些跟他交易更多的 主顾当然是很合算的，因为乡绅醉心于施展惩罚黑乔治的威风（单单一件 侵犯地界的罪名就可以把他毁掉），对其余的人也就不再去追究了。
倘若把这些事实真相全摆到奥尔华绥先生面前，看猎场的也许吃不到 多大苦头。可是再没有比热爱公道的人受到了疾恶如仇心情的激发更盲目 的了。布利非少爷忘记说明这是早已过去的事情，并且所讲情况与事实也 颇有些出入，仓促间把"一只"说成"几只"，就大大改变了事件的面貌；因 为按他说，乔治是张网捕了若干只兔子。要不是布利非少爷在透露这件事 情以前，曾要求奥尔华绥先生答应一定保密，这些不正确的说法本来也还 可以得到纠正的。这样一来，可怜的看猎场的不曾有个替自己辩护的机会
就给判了罪。既然打死兔子属实，乡绅控告他也是事实，奥尔华绥先生对 其他情节也就深信不疑了。
可怜乔治一家空欢喜了一场，因为第二天早晨奥尔华绥先生说，另外 有些事使他对乔治非常生气一一但又没说明是什么，只是严厉禁止汤姆再 提乔治的名字。他表示一定想法不让乔治的老婆孩子挨饿，至于看猎场的 本人，既然他非要犯法不可，那就只好听凭法律去处置他了。
汤姆猜不透奥尔华绥先生究竟为什么这样生气，因为他一点也没怀疑 到布利非少爷。可是不论遭到任何失望也不能动摇他对乔治的友谊，他决 定另想办法来搭救那个可怜的看猎场的人，免得他走上绝路。
近来琼斯和魏斯顿先生混得很熟。这位乡绅看到琼斯能跳过五根横档 的大门和他在狩猎方面的其他本领，很是佩服，并且对人说，这孩子只要 好好鼓励鼓励，将来一定大有出息。他常说，但愿他自己有这么个能干儿 子。在一次酒筵上，他郑重其事地宣布说，他愿意拿出一千镑的赌注来让 汤姆带着一群猎狗跟国内随便哪个猎人比赛打猎。
琼斯凭他这套本事取得了乡绅的欢心，成为他的座上宾和行猎时中意 的伙伴。凡是乡绅心爱的东西，诸如他的枪、狗和马，如今琼斯全可以随 便使用，就像他自己的一样。因此，他决定利用乡绅对他的宠爱，替朋友 帮忙，把黑乔治介绍到魏斯顿家里，仍然干他在奥尔华绥先生家里干的活 儿。
倘若读者想到魏斯顿先生对看猎场的早已发生恶感，并考虑到惹得乡 绅大发脾气的那件严重事情，也许就会认为汤姆这样做是愚蠢的，决没有 成功的希望。可是倘若读者因此而不留余地地斥责小琼斯，那么他同时也 应大大夸奖汤姆不畏困难，利用一切门路去解救旁人。
琼斯就是为了这件事去接近魏斯顿先生的女儿的。那位小姐年约十七 岁。除了上面提到的那些行猎时必需的一切以外，魏斯顿先生最珍爱的莫 过于他这个女儿了。她在乡绅面前是说得上话的，而汤姆在她面前也是说 得上话的。但是这位小姐是预定要作本书的女主人公的，作者非常敬爱 她，而许多读者在故事结束之前也一定会爱上她，所以我们不便委屈她， 让她在一卷书的结尾出场。

一年里的事
第一章
共占五页
我们这部书与那些无聊的传奇不同之处就在于它的真实性。那些传奇 满纸妖魔鬼怪，乃是不健全的头脑胡想出来的，不是自然的产物。因此， 一位杰出的批评家［1］推荐说，它只对烤点心的厨师有用。另一方面，我们也 要避免与另一种史书有任何类似之处。有一位著名的诗人⑵似乎认为那是为 了让酿酒商赚钱而写的，因为读那种史书的时候手里总离不开一杯好麦 酒，正是：
段段历史尽凄凉，
唯借麦酒解愁肠。［3］
既然麦酒是当代历史家们的饮料一一倘若按照勃特勒所持的灵感乃来 自麦酒的见解，它甚至还许是历史女神的饮料，那么它理应也是一切阅读 史籍者的饮料，因为一部书以什么精神和态度写成的，就得以同样的精神 和态度去读。《侯洛斯拉姆勃》［4］的名作者告诉一位学问渊博的主教说，主 教大人所以欣赏不出他的作品之妙处，乃是因为他读的时候手里不曾拿着 小提琴，而他自己创作的时候，手一直也没离开过那把乐器。
为了使这部作品不至和这类历史家的大著混淆起来，我们在全书各处 尽量点缀了各式各样的比喻、描绘和富有诗意的词藻。这些正是用来代替 前面所说的麦酒的，以便瞌睡虫入侵的时候给读者提提神。因为在一部长 篇巨著里读者和作者都难免受到瞌睡虫的侵袭，倘若没有这种穿插，单靠 事实的平铺直叙，不管叙述得多么娓娓动听，任何读者也忍受不了。除非 一个人具备荷马所说的那种宙斯所独有的永不懈怠的警觉，否则像这样一 部卷帙浩繁的报纸般的作品，他是无论如何也读不下去的。
我们是出于何种考虑而选定了该把这些点缀的部分穿插在书中哪些地 方的，还有待读者去判断。大家总该承认现在是再合适没有的场合了，因 为我们马上就要介绍一位非同小可的人物登场，此人非他，正是我们这部 英雄散文史诗的女主人公。因此，为了迎接她的登场，我们认为事先应当 让读者的胸怀里充满了一切从自然界临摹下来的赏心悦目的形象。这种做 法是颇有些先例可援的。首先，这是我们悲剧诗人所熟知并且习用的一种
艺术，在他们的主人公登场以前，他们很少不让观众做好迎接主要人物的 准备。
因此，英雄总是在鼓角齐鸣中出场，以便激起观众的尚武精神，并让 他们的耳朵能够适应英雄的豪言壮语一一那种语言倘若洛克先生的盲人把 它比作号角声［5］的话，谅来相去也不太远。倘若出场的是一对恋人，往往总 是先奏出柔和的音乐，不是为了用缠绵的柔情来抚慰观众，就是为了哄他 们，把他们导入温存的梦乡一一在下一场里，他们就很有可能享受这种清 福。
不但这些诗人，就是他们的老板一一剧院经理，似乎也懂得这个诀 窍：英雄出场之前，除了用前面所提到的铜鼓和其他乐器来预示之外，通 常还有六七个搬道具的人组成一支大军替他打前锋。从下面这段舞台逸事 也可以看出这些跑龙套的对英雄的出场究竟有多么必要。
扮演庇勒斯王的正在剧院隔壁一家酒馆里吃着饭。这时候，有人喊他 去登场。这位英雄既不甘心撂下手边那块羊肘，又不愿意由于害观众久候 而开罪威尔克斯先生（跟他合伙的剧院经理）。于是，就收买那些替他打 前锋的人先躲在一边。这样，当威尔克斯先生大嚷大叫着"引庇勒斯王出台 的那些木匠哪里去了 ”的当儿，这位国王却安然吃着羊肘。观众不管多么不 耐烦也只好听听音乐来消磨时光，静候他的登场。
老实说，我估量那些嗅觉通常很敏锐的政客们多少也觉察出这种办法 的妙处。我深信那位令人肃然起敬的官员一一伦敦市长大人，就是靠着走 在他的威武行列前边的壮丽的仪仗队，才终年赢得人们的尊崇的。说实 话，甚至像我这样一个轻易不会为外观所迷惑住的人，也颇为先驱队的堂 皇场面所动哩。每当我在游行行列中看到一个昂首阔步的人，走在前边的 那些人看来都只不过是替他开路的，就比在一般情况下看到他，格外感到 他的尊严。但是有一种情况完全合乎我的心意，那就是这样一种习俗：行 加冕礼的时候让一个提花篮的女人走在这辉煌行列的前头，在大人物开始 游行之前，先由她在舞台上撒满鲜花。这件事古人们一定会乞灵于弗罗拉 孔 而且尽管弗罗拉是由凡人扮成，并执行她的任务的，当时的教士和政客 也不难使老百姓相信神仙真的下了凡。但是我们并不打算这样哄骗读者。 因此，那些反对异教邪说的人要是乐意的话，大可以把弗罗拉易为上述的 那个提花篮的女人。简而言之，我们无非是想尽量严肃地，用高雅的文体 以及其他足以在读者心中引起敬意的境况下来介绍我们的女主人公。不论
这位女主人公的形象有多么可爱，既然她确实是从自然中临摹下来的，那 么我们就会发现，在乡村美人当中，有许多是值得人们倾倒的，完全符合 我们笔下所能描绘的+全十美的理想女性的形象。倘若没有这点把握，为 了某种缘故我们也就会奉劝那些稍懂风情的男性读者掩卷不要读下去了。
闲话少说，现在我们就转入下一章。
第二章
一段关于苏菲亚-魏斯顿小姐的描绘，并略示庄严文笔所能达到的 境界
安静吧，一切较大的风。愿各路风的异教主宰用铁链锁住吵吵闹闹的 波利亚斯⑵的活跃的四肢和优若士的刺人肌肤的尖鼻。温柔的采佛勒斯⑵ 请从芳榻上起来，升上西方的天空，刮起和畅的微风，把可爱的弗罗拉从 她那荡漾着露珠香气的绣房里召唤出来吧。在她的生日一一六月一日那一 天，这位丽人就轻装缓带，从碧草绿茵上徐徐飘过。百花都起而向她顶礼 膜拜，遍地五彩缤纷，丽色和芳香竞相使她心旷神怡。
愿如此美丽的苏菲亚现在出现吧。大自然的羽族合唱队，便是韩德尔口 也谱不出你们那样动人的曲调，请放开你们悦耳的歌喉，欢迎她登场吧。 你们的歌声发自爱情，又以爱情为终结。请在每个青年的心里唤起甜蜜的 情思吧，因为看哪，可爱的苏菲亚出来了。大自然把一切魅力都赋予了 她，用姿容、青春、活泼、天真、谦恭和温柔来打扮她。芬芳从她的樱唇 里呼出，她那双晶莹的眸子射出灿烂的光辉。
读者，你也许见过美第奇的爱神像以，你或者也曾鉴赏过汉普顿宫苑的 百美画廊以。你大概还记得可与丘吉尔严媲美的神采飞扬的群艳，以及吉特， 凯特也］俱乐部中大家为之干杯祝贺的美女吧。倘若你没赶上她们的风流年 华，至少会看过她们的女儿一一一个个也都是当代的绝色佳丽。如果把她 们的芳名罗列下来，怕要满满写上一卷哩。
倘若这些你都看过，那么就不必担心听到罗切斯特伯爵四某次在回答一 位见多识广的人时所说的那句唐突话。不，要是你见过这一切还不知道什 么是美，你就是有眼无珠；要是还感觉不到美的魅力，那你就是铁石心 肠。
然而，朋友，纵使你见过所有这些美人，也仍未必就能确切地想象出 苏菲亚的容貌，因为她跟其中任何一个美人长得都不完全一样。她很像蓝 妮拉夫人的那幅画像，也有人说她更像著名的玛萨琳公爵夫人也，但是她最 像的莫如时刻萦绕作者心怀的那个人儿叫。朋友，倘若你记得她，那你就会 对苏菲亚的芳容有个轮廓了。
恐怕你不会有这份眼福，我们就尽力之所及描绘一下这位绝代丽人 ――虽然我们深知纵使把全副本领施展出来，也还是难以胜任的。
魏斯顿先生的独生女苏菲亚是中等身材，或者比中等略高一些。她长 得不但端正，而且极其标致。从她那双肥瘦适中的胳膊也可以想见她的四 肢有多么匀称。她的头发是乌黑的，在她按照时兴样式把它剪短以前，本 来是又浓又密，一直垂到腰际。现在她的头发非常巧妙地鬈在颈后，很少 人会相信那是她自己的头发。倘若出于妒忌，一定要在她脸庞上吹毛求疵 的话，也许有人会说她的前额要是稍高一些就好了。她的双眉密而匀整， 像弯弯的新月，决不是人工所能描绘得出的。不管她有多么温柔，那对黑 眸子里闪着的光辉也丝毫不会减弱。她的鼻子着实端正，嘴里生着两排珠 贝。嘴唇正像约翰•塞克林爵士四的诗里所描写的：
双唇竞嫣红， 上唇似微薄;
下唇非独厚， 实为蜂所蜇。
她的脸是椭圆形的，右腮上有个酒涡，微微一笑就露出来。她面部的俊美 自然也得力于她的下巴，然而很难说它是大还是小，也许偏乎前者。她的 肤色与其说像玫瑰，不如说更像百合。然而每当她由于运动或害羞而脸上 发红的时候，连银朱也比它不上。人们一见，不禁要朗吟端恩也博士的名 句：
――她那纯洁而雄辩的血，
在脸颊上发言，那样清晰， 你几乎可以说她的肢体也会思想。
她的脖子纤秀，俯仰多姿。如果不怕对她唐突的话，说它胜过著名的美第 奇的爱神也不为过。百合、象牙或石膏全没它那么白。想必是出于妒忌， 那极细的白麻纱内衣才遮住比它本身还要白净得多的胸脯。正是：
Nitor splendens Pario marmore purius.[20]
放射出比培乐岛[21]的大理石更加皎洁的光辉。
这就是苏菲亚的外表了。寓在其中的心灵也无愧于这美丽的形体。苏 菲亚的心灵丝毫也不比她的姿容逊色。反之，她的相貌和她的灵魂的美相 得益彰。每逢她微笑的时候，她那温柔娴静的性格就在她的容颜上焕发出 光辉来，那光辉却决非仅仅来自漂亮的面孔。不过，我们既然打算介绍读 者去和这位漂亮的姑娘十分接近，而这样一来她心灵的美就会统统显示出 来，这里也就不必细讲了一一不，那样做无形中是对读者理解力的一种侮 辱，而且也剥夺了他们对这位女主人公的品格自作判断的乐趣。
不过可以这样说，苏菲亚先天带来的一切才分，多少也经过一些人为 的琢磨。她是在一位姑母抚育下长大的，这位姑母是很有见识的女人，她 年轻时曾出入过宫廷，见过不少世面，近几年才到乡间来隐居。苏菲亚由 于和她接触，得她指导，受到极好的教养；只是她的谈吐举止之间也许还 缺乏一种潇洒的风度，那只有靠上流社会的耳濡目染来养成了。然而老实 说，为了取得这种风度而付出的代价往往是太高了。尽管它有无法言说的 美妙，以致每当法国人品评一个人的短长时，有一项优点他们总说难以言 传，指的也许就是这种潇洒风度。不过苏菲亚身上的这点缺陷却早已为她 的天真纯洁所弥补了，而一个有见识和天性温柔的人是永远不需要靠这种 潇洒风度来装点的。
第三章
这段书追溯一桩若干年前发生的小事;事情虽小，对日后却颇有影 响
可爱的苏菲亚在这部书里露面的时候，正当+八岁。前面已经交代 过，她父亲对她钟爱极了，因此，汤姆•琼斯就央求她，替他那看猎场的朋 友谋个生计。
可是在叙述这件事情之前，我们必得先把某些往事扼要地补上一笔。
尽管奥尔华绥和魏斯顿两位先生由于脾气不同，交往并不很亲密，可 是两家之间倒也有着一般的来往，因而两家的小一辈人自幼就很熟；既然 年岁都差不多，自然时常在一起玩耍。
布利非少爷严肃而冷静，汤姆则愉快活泼；两人比起来，还是汤姆更 合苏菲亚的口味。她对汤姆偏袒得十分露骨，倘若遇上比布利非少爷涵养 差一些的小伙子，也许会表示出不快来。
可是既然布利非少爷自己丝毫也没流露出反感来，如果我们一定还要 向他的心灵深处去探索，那就未免有失忠厚了一一就像某些无聊之徒窥伺 朋友们的隐秘，往往偷看他们的衣橱碗柜，不过是为向世人暴露他们的寒 伧和吝啬。
然而如果一个人以为自己触怒了旁人，他往往也就很容易认定旁人真 是被触怒了。所以布利非少爷的某一举动在具有真知灼见的屠瓦孔和斯奎 尔看来虽是出于一种高尚的动机，但是苏菲亚则认为他是乘机泄愤。
汤姆-琼斯小时候曾送过一只小鸟给苏菲亚，那是他亲自从鸟窝里掏 到，把它养大的，并且教会了它唱歌。
那时候苏菲亚十三岁，她非常喜欢这只鸟，成天饲养它，照料它，她 最大的乐事就是跟小鸟玩耍。于是小汤米（这就是小鸟的名字）变得十分 驯熟，它可以在女主人的掌心啄食，栖在她的指头上，惬意地伏在她的胸 间，看起来它已意识到自己有多么幸福。但是苏菲亚总在它的腿上系一根 小绳，从不让它自由飞翔。
有一天，奥尔华绥先生举家到魏斯顿先生家吃饭，布利非少爷跟小苏 菲亚在花园里玩耍。他看出苏菲亚十分喜爱那只小鸟，就要求她把小鸟交 给他玩一会儿。苏菲亚马上答应了这位少爷的要求，先再三叮咛一下，然
后才把小汤米交给他。可是布利非刚一接到手，就松开小鸟腿上的绳子， 把它朝天空撒去。
那只愚蠢的鸟一察觉自己获得了自由，立刻就把苏菲亚对它的抚育之 恩忘得一干二净，径直飞去，落在不远处一枝树杈上。
苏菲亚看到她的小鸟跑掉了，就大声叫喊。汤姆•琼斯正在附近，他赶 紧奔过来帮忙。
他一听说事情的原委，就骂布利非是个可耻的居心不良的坏蛋，然后 脱下外衣，爬上小鸟逃去的那棵树。
小鸟落的那枝树杈直伸到水渠上。在汤姆刚刚要逮住那只跟他同名的 小鸟的当儿，树杈突然折断，可怜的孩子就一头栽到水里去了。
这时，苏菲亚所关怀的对象改变了。一看到汤姆有性命危险，她就用 比以前大十倍的声音嚷叫起来，布利非少爷也跟着她使勤地喊。
主人和客人正坐在紧靠花园的一个房间里，听到喊叫，吓得立刻奔了 出来。但是等他们走到水渠边的时候，汤姆（幸而那段渠水很浅）已经平 安地爬上了岸。
屠瓦孔恶狠狠地朝可怜的汤姆扑了过去，那孩子浑身湿漉漉的滴着 水，哆哆嗦嗦地站在他跟前。这时，奥尔华绥先生叫屠瓦孔先按捺一下， 然后转过来问布利非少爷："孩子，告诉我这是怎么搞的？"
布利非少爷回答说："舅父，对我自己所做的事，我感到十分抱歉。真 糟糕，这一切全是我引起来的。我拿着苏菲亚小姐的鸟，想到这个可怜的 小动物一定渴望着获得自由，我承认自己忍不住就把它渴望的东西给了 它。我一向认为把任何东西拴起来都未免太残酷了。在我看来，束缚任何 东西都是违反自然规律的，根据那规律万物都有享受自由的权利。这样做 甚至也不合乎教义，因为这就违背了'己所不欲，勿施于人'省这条原则。然 而倘若我料到苏菲亚小姐会这么难过，我是决不会放掉那只小鸟的。就在 琼斯少爷爬到树上捉它而跌下水去的当儿，小鸟又飞起来，随后就给一只 恶鹰叼走了。倘若我料到小鸟本身会落到这样的下场，我也不会把它放掉 的。”
可怜苏菲亚到此刻才听说她那小汤米所遭到的厄运（因为这件事发生 的时候，她的心神正贯注在琼斯身上，没来得及去理会它），于是她泪如 雨下。奥尔华绥先生竭力宽慰她，答应送她一只更好看的鸟，可是苏菲亚 说，她绝不要旁的鸟了。她父亲责备她不该为一只傻鸟这么哭哭啼啼，可
又禁不住对小布利非说，如果他是他的儿子，屁股上少不得要挨一顿好 打。
苏菲亚这时回到自己的房间，两位年轻哥儿也给打发回家了，其余的 人又饮起酒来。他们把话题转到那只鸟上去，这席谈话饶有趣味，我们认 为值得单独用一章来叙述。
第四章
这一章里写的事情既深奥又严肃，未必投合有些读者的口味
斯奎尔刚点上烟斗，就对奥尔华绥先生讲开了。他说："先生，我真不 能不向您道贺，跟前能有这么好的一位外甥。一般像他这样年纪的孩子， 脑子里只会在看得见、摸得着的东西上打转，而他居然有明察是非的能 力。束缚任何东西，在我看来，都是违反自然规律的，根据这条规律，万 物都有享受自由的权利。这是您外甥说的话，而这几句话在我心上留下的 印象，是永远也不会磨灭的。对于正义的规律和事物永恒的适当性，还有 谁比他理解得更透彻？他小小年纪就如此出众，我不禁预料这位青年来日 登峰造极的时候，必然会与大、小布鲁图鬼不相上下的。”
这时候，屠瓦孔赶紧也插了进来。他撒了些酒，急忙把余酒一饮而 尽，然后接下去说："从布利非少爷所说的另外一句话看来，我认为他日后 会比布鲁图还要了不起哩。自然规律不过是胡说八道，我从来也没听说过 这样一条规律，也不晓得它能产生出什么权利来。’己所不欲，勿施于人'这 句话倒确实是基督教的教旨，那孩子说得不错。我真高兴我的教育发生了 这样好的效果。”
"倘若虚荣心符合事物的适当性的话，"斯奎尔说，"那么我也有理由来 夸夸口。小少爷这种对善恶是非的观念究竟是从哪里学来的，我看是不言 而喻的。如果没有自然规律，也就没有了善恶是非。”
"怎么？"牧师说，"你难道否定上帝的启示姓吗？我究竟是在跟一个自 然神论丝］者谈话，还是跟一个无神论者谈话？”
"还是喝酒吧，"魏斯顿说，"什么自然规律不规律的，去它的吧！我不 懂你们俩讲的那善恶是非指的是什么，在我看来，把我女儿的鸟抢去就是 不对。咱街坊奥尔华绥爱怎么办就怎么办，可是纵容孩子去干这种勾当， 就是把他们养大了好上断头台。”
奥尔华绥回答说：为他外甥所干的事，他表示抱歉，然而他不同意去 处罚他，因为他原是出于一种崇高的动机，没存什么恶意。他说，倘若布 利非偷走了那只鸟，他会比谁都更坚决主张处罚这孩子的，可是显然他没 有这种打算。事实上，他认为除了孩子所表白的以外，他不可能有别的用 心一一至于苏菲亚所怀疑的那种恶意，奥尔华绥先生是从来想也没想过
的。最后，他再一次责备他外甥的轻举妄动，姑念他年幼无知，才勉强饶 恕。
斯奎尔已经明白说出了他自己的看法，倘若现在闭口不言，那就只好 听任对方指责他的判断。因此，他颇为激动地说："奥尔华绥先生对所有权 这样的污秽的东西，未免太过于重视了。当我们对伟大、卓越的行为下判 断的时候，一切个人考虑都应置诸度外。正是拘于这种狭隘的准则，人们 才骂小布鲁图忘恩负义，大布鲁图犯了弑父之罪丝。"
"要是这两个人因此而给送上了绞刑架，"屠瓦孔嚷道，"那也只能说他 们罪有应得。一对异教的痞子！谢天谢地，咱们如今没有什么布鲁图啦。 斯奎尔先生，我希望你再也别往我这两个学生的头脑里灌输这种违背基督 教义的邪说了，因为只要他们在我的训导之下一天，我就会用鞭子把这种 邪说照样给抽出去的。你的高足汤姆差不多已经毁掉了。那天我听见他跟 布利非少爷争论说，光有信仰而没有善行，信仰就是空的。我素知这是你 的一个论点，想必是你传授给他的。”
"你休要责备我毁掉他吧，"斯奎尔说，"是谁唆使他嘲笑一切合乎道德 的，一切合情合理、尽善尽美的事物的？他倒真是你的高足，我不承认他 是我门下的。不，布利非少爷才是我的学生呢。尽管他年纪那么轻，我却 瞧不出你有什么本领能够摧毁这孩子正直的道德观！”
屠瓦孔听了带着轻蔑神情讥讽说："我敢放心大胆地把他交给你。他已 经打下了深厚的基础，你的任何冒牌哲学也不足以把他引入邪道。不， 不，事先我已经注意把道理灌输给他……”
"我也把道理灌输给他了 ！"斯奎尔嚷道，"除了崇高的道德观，还有什 么更能启发人心，使它产生释放小鸟这样仁慈的想法呢？我再向你说一 遍：如果骄傲符合事物的适当性的话，那么，把这些观念灌输给布利非少 爷的光荣理应属于我。”
"倘若自豪感是可以容许的话，"屠瓦孔说，"我敢夸句口说，布利非少 爷本人认定是自己行动指南的那种责任感，正是我培养起来的。”
"原来你们俩一道教那个小少爷来抢我女儿的鸟呀！"乡绅说，"看来我 得好好当心我的鹧鸪笼，不然的话，就会让什么讲究道德或笃信宗教的人 全给放掉了。"说完这话他就拍了拍在座的一位律师的背，大声嚷道："律 师先生，你怎么说？这件事违不违法？ ”
律师十分庄重地讲出一番道理：
“如果这个案子涉及鹧鸪,诉讼当然可以成立，因为这虽然是fer无 natures,然而既然有人要求归还，这就产生了所有权问题。但是案情所 牵涉的是一只唱歌的鸟，这是一种下等动物，尽管有人要求归还，法院必 须把它看作nullius in bonis四。在这种情势之下，原告必须撤回诉状。因 此，鄙人认为还是不要起诉为妙。”
“得啦，"乡绅说，"既然是nullus bonus［鸟，咱们就还是来喝酒，聊聊 国家大事或者大家都懂得的事吧。我敢说，刚才你讲的那些，我一个字也 不懂。你那些话也许蛮有学问和道理，可是你总没办法叫我听进耳去。见 鬼，你们谁也不曾提一声那个值得夸奖的可怜的孩子，他冒着摔断脖子的 危险去替我女儿效劳，这就是一种侠义行为一一我还没有糊涂到连这一点 也看不出。妈的，咱们该为汤姆的健康干上一杯！我活着一天，就要疼这 孩子一天。”
两位塾师间的争论就这样给打断了。要不是奥尔华绥先生接着就吩咐 备车，把双方都带走的话，他们还会又争起来的。
小鸟事件以及由此而引起的一段对话，到此就结束了。尽管这事发生 的时间比本书这里所讲的时期要早几年，我们还是不能不在此追记一笔。
第五章
一些雅俗共赏的事
“Parva leves capiunt animos”四 “细微的事打动轻快的心”，这 是一位恋爱大师的体会。果不其然，从那天起苏菲亚就开始对汤姆•琼斯有 了好感，而对他那个同伴则十分厌恶。
不时有许许多多出其不意的事情更加深了她这两种感情。不用细说， 读者从前边介绍的这两个孩子截然不同的性格，以及汤姆如何远比另外那 个孩子投合苏菲亚的心意，也可以加以推断。老实说，苏菲亚很小的时候 就看出，尽管汤姆是个懒散、马虎的调皮鬼，可是除了他自己，他谁也不 曾损害过。那布利非少爷虽然举止稳重，是个既精明又谨慎的小绅士，然 而他一心一意就只关心一个人的利益一一至于那个人是谁，不消我们指点 读者也一定猜得出来。
就人类本身的利益而言，对这两种人本应分别看待，然而大家对待他 们的态度却往往并不那么泾渭分明。这也许有策略上的考虑：当人们发现 一颗真正善良的心时，他们很该认为是发现了一件珍宝，像获得任何好东 西一样，渴望独自占有它。想来他们思量如果大声颂扬这样一个人，那就 无异于（用粗浅的话来说）大声喊人来分享他们打算独自享受的烤肉。倘 若这个理由不足以使读者信服，我就没有旁的办法来说明何以大家对一个 真正替人类争光夺彩、造福社会的人，会那样等闲看待。然而苏菲亚却不 是这样。几乎从她刚懂得敬重和鄙夷的含义的那天起，她就敬重汤姆-琼 斯，鄙夷布利非少爷。
苏菲亚曾经跟她姑妈住过三年多。在她离家这段期间，她很少见到这 两个少年，不过她陪她姑妈到奥尔华绥家里吃过一次饭。那是在我们上文 讲过的鹧鸪事件之后不久。席间，她听到了这件事情的前后经过，然而她 一句话也没说。在回家的途中，她姑妈也没能从她嘴里问出什么来。可是 当她的女仆帮她卸装、无意中说了一句"小姐，您今天见到布利非少爷了 吧”的时候，她才十分气愤地回答说："我讨厌布利非少爷这个名字，正像 我讨厌一切无信无义的下流东西一样。真奇怪，只为了汤姆的一片好心 肠，奥尔华绥先生竟然让那个野蛮的老学究把那可怜的孩子重重打了一 顿！ ”随后，她把事情的经过向她的女仆叙述一遍，最后说："你看他不是 个富有侠义心肠的孩子吗？ ”
如今，这位小姐回到她父亲身边，魏斯顿让她主持家政，用饭的时候 叫她坐在上席，汤姆也时常来做客一一他由于嗜好打猎，大受乡绅的宠 爱。胸襟开朗、性情豁达的小伙子自然容易待人殷勤，倘若再像汤姆那样 聪颖而又有见识，那么这种殷勤就会变为对一切妇女的关怀体贴。这一 点，不论跟那些粗暴浮躁的乡绅们还是跟态度严肃、性格有几分阴沉的布 利非少爷相比，都是大大不同的。如今在二十岁上，汤姆在这一带妇女当 中就以漂亮小伙子驰名了。
汤姆对待苏菲亚并无任何特殊之处，也许只不过对她比对旁人更敬重 一些。就苏菲亚的容貌、家财、见识和温柔可亲的风姿而论，这似乎也是 理所当然的。然而汤姆在她身上却从来没动过其他念头。我们姑且让读者 们去责难他愚钝，但也许以后将能作出令人满意的说明。
苏菲亚极其天真柔顺，性情又异常活泼。每当汤姆在场的时候，她就 更加活泼起来一一汤姆要不是过于年轻和疏忽大意，他一定会察觉到这一 点的；而倘若魏斯顿先生不是一心一意只惦记着他的猎场、马厩和犬舍， 这种情形也许会多少引起他的妒忌了。然而那位可敬的乡绅从来也没起过 疑心，所以他使汤姆获得了一个恋人梦寐以求的一切接近他女儿的机会。 汤姆只是依着他那生来殷勤、纯良的性子行事，可是这么一来，倒使他比 常存觊觎之心处于更加有利的地位。
难怪大家对这事都没加理会，因为连可怜的苏菲亚自己也不曾察觉。 没等她意识到自己身临险境，她已经深深堕入情网，不能自拔了。
就在这种情势下，一天下午，汤姆乘苏菲亚独自呆着的时候，跑过 去，先客气了几句，然后庄重地对她说，他想求她一件事，希望她出于好 心，肯帮帮忙。
其实，不论这年轻人的举动或他恳求的方式，都完全不应使姑娘疑心 汤姆是有意向她表示爱情，然而不知是大自然在她耳畔低语了什么呢，还 是由于旁的缘故，她心里却蓦然冒出了这个想法，于是她面颊顿然失色， 周身都战栗起来。要是汤姆这时停下来等她答话，那她一定会张口结舌 的。可是汤姆接着就提出了他的请求，因而解除了她的困惑：他求苏菲亚 可怜可怜那个看猎场的，说如果魏斯顿先生把这个人告到法院，就非断送 他和他那一大家人不可。
这时，苏菲亚已经从适才那阵慌乱心情中恢复过来了。她嫣然一笑， 回答说："这就是你那么郑重其事地向我提出的重大请求吗？好，我一定全
心全意地替你效劳。其实，我也很同情那个可怜的人，就在昨天还送了点 东西给他的妻子。"那点东西指的就是她的一件长衫、几件内衣和+先令现 款。汤姆已经听说了，事实上，正因为如此他才想到来求她帮忙。
这个请求得到成功，越发鼓起我们这位小伙子的勇气。他决定更进一 步，大胆恳求苏菲亚在她父亲跟前举荐黑乔治，强调他认为这一带没有比 这个人更老实的了，最适合于干看猎场这个差事，而当时又恰巧有个空 缺。
苏菲亚回答说："好，这个我也应承下来。关于前一个要求，我准保死 说活说，一定说到我爹答应了才罢休。可是对后一个要求，我可不敢担保 一定也能行。不过我一定尽力帮这个可怜人的忙，因为我打心坎上同情他 和他的一家。那么，琼斯先生，现在我也有件事请你帮忙。”
"帮忙，小姐！"汤姆大声说，"您只要晓得我一听说您可能吩咐我做点 什么就会多么高兴，那么您一定会认识到：您的吩咐就是对我莫大的恩 宠。凭您这只可爱的手起誓，我情愿牺牲自己的性命来为您效劳。”
说完这话，他就热烈地抓住苏菲亚的手，吻了起来。这是他的嘴唇初 次接触到她。适才苏菲亚的双颊上失去的血色，这时猛地冲上了脸，一下 子连脖子也绯红了。她此刻体验到一种前所未有的感觉。等她稍微平静下 来，回味这种感觉时，才开始领会到自己心中一些秘密一一倘若读者还没 猜到那是什么样的秘密，到了应该知道的时候，就一定会知道的。
苏菲亚刚一说得出话来（她不是马上就说得出话来的），她就告诉汤 姆，要他帮的忙是：以后再去打猎，别领她爹冒那么多风险。关于这方面 她听到过种种说法，因而每回他们两个一道出去打猎，她总是提心吊胆 的，生怕有朝一日她爹折臂断腿给抬了回来。因此，她求汤姆为了她的缘 故，千万要多加小心。既然他准知道魏斯顿先生总是在他后边追赶，那么 以后骑马就不要跑得那么快，也不要跨越危险的地方。
汤姆答应一定遵照她的嘱咐，对苏菲亚惠然允诺他的请求表示了谢 意；他对自己取得的成功心满意足，就告辞走了。
可怜的苏菲亚也心满意足，但是原因却大大不同。她感到的究竟是怎 样一种滋味，读者心里（倘若他或她有一颗心的话）一定会有更深刻的体 会。纵使我有诗人所希望的那么多张嘴，吃下为他准备的种种美味，也不 能描绘得那么深刻。
魏斯顿先生有个习惯，每天下午吃醉了酒就要听女儿弹琴。他十分爱 好音乐，倘若他住在城里，还可能会被当作一位鉴赏家，因为他总是反对 韩德尔先生的杰作。在音乐方面，除了轻松活泼的小曲之外，他一概都不 喜欢。他最心爱的曲子就是《国王老西蒙爵士》、《效忠英格兰的圣乔 治》、《快活的琼》和几首别的。
尽管他的女儿精通音乐，除了韩德尔先生的作品之外她从来不愿意弹 旁的曲子；可是为了讨她父亲的欢心，还是把那些小曲都学会了，好弹给 他听。不过有时她也想法把魏斯顿先生对音乐的兴趣引导到她这方面来。 每当魏斯顿要她把那些小曲再弹一遍时，苏菲亚就说："好爸爸，别这 样！"她往往央求魏斯顿先生准许她奏点旁的什么。
可是这一天晚上，魏斯顿放下酒瓶来听他女儿弹琴的时候，苏菲亚不 等她父亲开口，就把所有他心爱的曲子全都一连弹了三遍。这下使得乡绅 高兴得从躺椅上跳起来，亲了他女儿一下，发誓赌咒说，她的琴技大大长 进了。她就乘这机会来履行她向汤姆许下的诺言。事情办得十分成功，乡 绅甚至说，要是她肯把《老西蒙爵士》为他再弹上一遍，他明天早晨就派 乔治去看猎场。《老西蒙爵士》一遍又一遍地弹了下去，直弹到音乐的魅 力使魏斯顿先生昏然入睡了。第二天早晨，苏菲亚自然没有忘记提醒她父 亲许下的诺言，乡绅立刻派人把他的律师找来，吩咐他不要再进行诉讼， 同时，叫他委派给黑乔治看猎场的差事。
汤姆办的这件事，很快就传遍了那一带，并引起种种不同的议论。有 的夸奖说是一件善举，也有的讥谓说："二流子当然怜惜二流子。"小布利 非则气愤异常。长久以来，他对黑乔治的仇恨程度不亚于汤姆对黑乔治的 喜爱。这倒不是因为黑乔治什么地方开罪了他，而是由于他自己笃信宗 教，崇尚道德，而黑乔治却是个有名的浪荡汉。因此，布利非把这件事说 成是汤姆有意跟奥尔华绥先生作对。他十分痛心地说，对这样一个痞子做 好事，决找不出旁的动机来。
屠瓦孔和斯奎尔也唱着同样的论调。由于那位寡妇的关系，他们两个 （尤其是斯奎尔）非常忌恨小琼斯。因为现在汤姆•琼斯快二十岁了，小伙 子长得着实英俊漂亮。那位太太越来越宠爱他，似乎也越来越觉得他漂 亮。
然而奥尔华绥先生并不曾受到他们的挑唆，他对琼斯所做的事表示+ 分满意。他认为这种始终不渝的真挚友谊很值得赞扬，他还希望更多地看
到这样的善举。
但是命运女神总不大赏识像我们的朋友汤姆这类的漂亮小伙子一一也 许由于他们并不怎么热切地向她献殷勤。突然之间，命运女神把汤姆的一 切举动全加以颠倒，使得仁厚的奥尔华绥先生忽然换了个眼光，他原来认 为可以嘉许的事现在却不那么看了。

第六章
表白一下琼斯先生何以对妩媚的苏菲亚种种可爱之处无动于衷;在 那些赞赏当代喜剧里的男主角的风流雅士心目中，他的身价可能因
由于我们男主人公对待苏菲亚的态度，恐怕有两种人已经对他有了些 轻蔑之意：一种人怪他不够精明，竟然错过一个可以攫取魏斯顿先生全部 家产的大好机会；另外一种人因为他在这么一位漂亮小姐面前裹足不前， 也同样藐视他，而只要他张开臂膀，这位姑娘似乎就会扑进他的怀抱里去 的。
尽管对他两方面的罪名我也许都无法替他开脱掉（对于不够精明这一 点他是无可推诿的，而关于后一点，我所能提出的辩护看来也难以令人满 意），然而有时候也可以通过证词使被告获得减刑，所以我就把事实原原 本本地摊开，全部是非曲直任凭读者来裁决。
琼斯先生具有某种气质，究竟应该称它什么，作家们还没取得一致的 意见，然而它确乎存在于某些人的心中。这种气质的作用与其说是辨别善 恶，倒不如说是激发人去行善，阻止人去作恶。
这真有些像剧院里那位著名的"箱子匠”也］。因为当具有这种气质的人做 得对的时候，再也没有比狂热的、友好的观众那么喝彩喝得响亮而热烈的 了。反之，倘若他演得砸了锅，再也没有比批评家那么急于喝倒彩，轰他 下台的了。
用一个更高深一些的，同时也是我们这个时代更熟悉些的比喻来说明 我心中所指的这个原则吧。这东西坐在我们心灵王国的宝座上，就像英国 大法官坐在审判厅里一样，它根据公道和正义来主持、审理、指挥、裁判 各种案件，对被告判刑或作出免予起诉的决定。他的知识使他能洞察一 切，明智不容他受任何人的欺骗，廉正不容他被任何人收买。
我们与禽兽之间的主要分野，也许正是在于这样一种行为的准绳。倘 若只具备人的外形，而又不受这一准绳的约束，我宁愿把他看作从人群中 逃到禽兽那边去的叛徒。既然是叛徒，在禽兽当中他们也算不得佼佼者。
究竟是由于屠瓦孔还是斯奎尔的教诲，我不便断言，总之，我们的主 人公确乎坚决按照这个准绳行事。尽管他不是事事都做得对，然而每逢做 了什么错事，他从没有不感到痛心疾首的。正是这个准绳使他懂得：人家
殷勤款待你，你却把他家抢劫一空来报答他，那是天底下最卑鄙下流的盗 贼行为。他更不认为造成的损失增大，就会减轻这种行为的卑鄙程度。反 之，依他看来，倘若偷了人家一碗一碟都要判处死刑，褫夺公权，那么既 抢了人家的全部家产又夺走人家的女儿，这样的罪恶是不论怎样惩罚都不 算过分的。
由于有这个准绳，他从不曾想到靠这种手段来发迹一一我前边已经说 过，这是一种行为的准绳，仅仅懂得或相信它还是不够的。倘若汤姆真正 爱上了苏菲亚，他也可能会另有想法。可是请容我说一句：为了爱情同为 了霸占财产而夺取一个人的女儿，这是截然不同的两回事。
尽管这位年轻人对苏菲亚的种种迷人之处不是毫无所觉一一他十分爱 慕她的美貌，钦佩她的人品才能，可是苏菲亚在他心上并没留下很深的印 象。人们可能因此而怪汤姆愚钝不灵，至少也会嫌他缺乏审美的能力，所 以我们现在就来解释一下。
事实真相是：他的心已经给另外一个女人占去了。读者听了谅必感到 诧异，何以书里一直没提到过这件事。既然我们丝毫没透露过有什么人会 成为苏菲亚的情敌，读者也就无从猜出她究竟是谁来。至于布利非太太， 尽管我们不得不提到她对汤姆似乎颇有感情，然而我们从来没让读者以为 汤姆也很爱她。遗憾的是，事实上少男少女对于上了年纪的人向他们表示 的眷爱关怀，往往不懂得去感恩报德。
读者不必再猜下去了。您大概还记得我们时常提到乔治•西格里姆（一 般都称他作"看猎场的黑乔治”）的一家，眼下是夫妻两个带着五个孩子过 活。
这家的老二是个女儿，名叫毛丽。大家都认为她是那一带生得最美的 姑娘之一。
康格利夫图说得好，真正的美，其中必有俗眼鉴赏不到的东西。即使衣 着褴褛或满身泥垢也不能瞒过独具慧眼的人。
汤姆本来并没理会这个姑娘生得俊美，可是毛丽到了十六岁上，差不 多大她三岁的汤姆才开始对她有了情意。而且在他对她有了感情之后很 久，他也没想到要占有她。虽然他健壮的体质常怂恿他去那么做，他所恪 守的行为准绳却仍强力制止了他。诱奸一个少女一一不论她多么贫贱，在 他看来总是件伤天害理的恶行，他对姑娘的父亲的一片好意以及他对这家
人的同情也都一再促使他慎重。因此，他曾经一度下过决心，有整整三个 月确实没进过西格里姆家的大门，也没和这家的女儿会面。
我们前边已经说过，大家都认为毛丽长得很漂亮，事实也确是这样。 然而她的美可并不是那种柔媚的美。她身上很少女人味儿。她的美对男人 起码是同样的相宜。说句老实话，青春和健壮在她的姿容上倒占了相当的 位置。
她的心灵也不比她的外貌更带女人气。她个子高大健壮，性格也粗率 孟浪。她丝毫不懂得羞涩腼腆，以致汤姆对她的贞洁比她自己更为担心。 她喜欢汤姆，谅必不下于汤姆喜欢她，所以当她看出汤姆裹足不前时，她 就越发向他追求起来。她一发现汤姆根本不到她家里来了，就设法在路上 撞见他，拼命挑逗他，除非汤姆是个大英雄，或者是个胆小鬼，才能不受 她的摆布。总之，没多久毛丽就把汤姆那些洁身自好的宏愿粉碎得一干二 净了。尽管在最后她还按照礼数装出半推半就的样子，然而我还是认为胜 利属于她，因为是她的计谋得到了成功。
在这件事上毛丽进行得+分巧妙，倒使琼斯把胜利完全归到自己头 上，认定那位年轻姑娘是屈服于他的热烈追求了。同时，他还把毛丽的首 肯看作是她对他有一腔热爱而情不自禁。读者谅必也会承认汤姆这种猜度 原是极其自然而合情合理的。前面我们已不止一次提到过他生得+分俊 秀，确乎是世界上最漂亮的小伙子之一。
世上有一种人一一例如布利非少爷，他们只爱自己一人，处处只考虑 本人的利益和享受；倘若不涉及自己的快乐和好处，对于旁人的祸福则完 全无动于衷。可见也有另一种秉性的人，他们即使出于利己的动机，却也 表现出一定程度的高尚品德。也就是说，这种人如果从旁人身上得到任何 快乐，就一定喜爱那个给予他们快乐的人，并把为这个人谋求幸福看作使 自己的心情获得安宁必不可少的条件。
我们的主人公就属于后一种。他认为这样一来，可怜的姑娘一生是幸 福还是痛苦，就完全靠他来决定了。汤姆仍然为她的美貌所吸引，虽然更 漂亮、更新鲜的目标也许更能吸引他。可是由于考虑到毛丽显然对他十分 钟情，以及这个姑娘为了他而陷入的境地，因欲望得到满足而出现在他心 中的低潮，又开始回涨。毛丽对他的钟情使他感激，毛丽的处境使他同 情；这两种情感之外，他还很喜欢毛丽的身子。这些在他心中产生了一种
感情，便是称它作"爱情"也不为过甚，虽然这么说，开头也许是不很妥帖 的。
汤姆之所以对苏菲亚的风姿毫不动心，对她的一些大可理解为鼓励他 去诉说爱情的言语动作，也熟视无睹，真正的原因就在于此。既然他不肯 遗弃毛丽（尽管她贫穷而且可怜），他自然不会想到去欺骗像苏菲亚这样 的人。而且，倘若他纵容自己对那位小姐滋生一点点爱情的话，他就必将 犯下这种或那种罪行。我在书中初次介绍他时，曾提过大家一致认为他的 下场将会如何；在我看来，不论他犯哪种罪过，他都必然逃不脱那个命 运。
第七章
本卷最短的一章
毛丽的母亲头一个看出女儿的肚子大了起来。为了遮掩四邻的耳目， 她糊里糊涂叫毛丽把苏菲亚送她的那件长衫穿上。那位小姐决没料到这可 怜的女人竟然会愚蠢到让她女儿在这种情况下去穿它。
这是毛丽生平头一遭有机会把自己打扮一下，她真是开心极了。尽管 即便穿得破破烂烂，对镜一照她也觉得自己蛮漂亮，而且就是穿得那么褴 褛她也征服了琼斯（也许还有别的人），但如再加上这件漂亮衣服，她准 会更惹人爱，因而也就会有更多的人为她倾倒了。
于是，到了星期日毛丽立刻就穿上那件长衫，戴上汤姆送她的镶花边 的新帽子和旁的装饰品，摇晃着扇子上礼拜堂去了。达官和贵人倘若认为 虚荣和野心是他们所专有的，那可大错特错了。不论在乡村教堂里或教堂 公墓边，不论在客厅还是在内室里，这种高贵的品德到处都有其突出的表 现。在小教堂圣器间里进行密谋不一定比教廷秘密会议上搞的阴谋诡计逊 色。这里同样有在朝和在野的；有圈套、权术，有党派和派系之争，与宫 廷里的情况完全一样。
这里的女人在运用那种卓越的女性艺术的能力方面，一点也不逊于那 些比她们显贵而富有的夫人小姐。这里有假正经，也有卖弄风情；有装模 作样，也有挤眉弄眼；有虚伪、妒忌、中伤、诽谤一一总之，举凡高雅集 会、上流社会中常见的一切勾当，这里都应有尽有了。因此，上流人士再 也不要藐视地位低贱于他们的人，说他们愚昧无知；小户人家也用不着去 嘲笑地位高于他们的人，说他们伤风败俗。
毛丽坐了好一会儿，邻座的人们还不曾认出她来。登时教堂里做礼拜 的人们就嘁嘁喳喳地耳语起来。"她是谁？”但是一认出她是毛丽，妇女中 间立刻就哄起一阵明讥暗笑、冷嘲热讽，以致奥尔华绥先生不得不用他的 权力来保持体统。
第八章
缪斯［33】仿荷马体咏唱的一场战斗，只有精谟古籍的人才能欣赏
魏斯顿先生在这个教区里有一片地，同时，他的宅院离这边的教堂并 不比离他本区的教堂远多少，所以他时常到这里来做礼拜。这时他和可爱 的苏菲亚恰好在场。
苏菲亚觉得毛丽长得好看，很是高兴。但是她又可怜毛丽不懂事，把 自己打扮成那个样子，在身份跟她不相上下的人们中间显然引起了妒忌。 苏菲亚一到家，马上就派人把看猎场的喊来，要他把毛丽带来，说她打算 在家里替毛丽安插个差事，也许就放在她身边服侍，因为苏菲亚的女仆这 时已经辞工不干，正要离去。
可怜的西格里姆听了这话，真是晴天霹雳，因为他完全清楚他女儿的 身子已出了毛病。他结结巴巴地说："恐怕毛丽笨手笨脚的，服侍不好小姐 ――她从来没服侍过人。”苏菲亚说："没关系，用不了多久她就会熟练 的。我喜欢这个姑娘，我一定要试用她。”
黑乔治立刻去找他的老婆，指望叫她出条妙计帮他摆脱这种窘境。可 是一回去，家里正闹得天翻地覆。原来那件长衫竟然惹起了一片激烈的妒 火，等奥尔华绥先生和其他绅士离开教堂后，那股一直抑制住的怒气就猛 然爆发了。始而还只是用辱骂、讥笑、嘘声和手势来发泄，继而就飞起某 些武器。尽管都是些软瘫瘫的东西，既不至于伤害性命，也打不断四肢， 然而对于一位穿得体体面面的姑娘，那还是十分可怕的。毛丽是个有血性 的，决不肯忍受下去。于是一一但是且住！既然我们对自己的能力信心不 足，还是让我们请一位高手来帮助一下吧。
那么，众缪斯，啊，不管您是哪一位，只要您喜欢歌咏战争一一尤其 是曾经咏过虎迪布拉斯和特鲁拉巡战场上的杀戮情景的，倘若您不曾和尊友 勃特勒一道饿死的话，就请乘这个伟大的时机助我一臂之力吧。人人并非 都是万能的。
倘若一群母牛正在一家殷实农家场院里挤奶的时候，听到远处它们的 牛犊因奶水被劫而发出哀鸣，必然会狂吼怒号。萨默塞特郡这批乌合之众 发出的喧闹也正是如此，这里人各不一，每人的情绪也不相同，他们发出 的声音也随之而异一一有的粗声呼叫，有的尖声嘶喊。这些人中间，有的 是怒气冲天，有的充满了恐怖，也有些人只不过是寻寻开心。主要还是妒
忌，这魔鬼的姊妹和忠实的伙伴，在这些人中间作祟，煽起妇女们的怒 火，所以她们一走到毛丽跟前，就用乌七八糟的脏东西往她身上乱投。
毛丽原想体面地撤退出去，然而情势不允许她那样；于是她掉转头 来，一把抓住敌军的前锋，衣衫褴褛的贝丝，把她打倒在地。尽管敌军有 约百人之众，可是看到了主帅的下场，便后退了若干步，撤到一座新掘的 墓穴后面一一这场血战是在教堂公墓上打的，那里当晚有人要安葬。毛丽 乘胜直追，抄起墓旁一只骷髅，猛力掼去，刚好命中裁缝的脑袋。这两个 脑壳骨一碰，咕隆一声，裁缝立刻倒了下去，直挺挺地躺在那块地上了； 两个脑壳骨并排摆着，简直说不清哪个更有用处一些。随后，毛丽又拾起 一根胯骨杀入那东逃西散的人群，朝四下里尽兴打去，把那些剽悍的男女 英雄们打得人仰马翻。
啊，缪斯，请你列举在这不幸的日子里倒下去的那些人们的名字吧。 首先就是杰米•特乌德尔，他的后脑壳让那可怕的胯骨揍了一下。他是在温 柔多姿的斯沱尔河美丽的河岸上长大起来的，在那里学会了声乐的艺术， 以后就各处流浪，在节日夜会和集市上，用他那歌喉为乡村的少男少女们 助兴：他们在草地上轻快地翩翩起舞，杰米站在一旁拉着提琴，随拉还随 跟着自己的节拍跳动。可是如今提琴对他是多么无用啊！他现在只能用自 己的身躯来敲打那绿色的草坪了。其次是阉猪的老埃奇普，他在脑内子上 挨了我们这位亚马孙女杰国一下，登时栽倒在地。他是个又肥又大的家伙， 倒下去就像塌了房一般。同时，他的烟盒子从口袋里掉出来，毛丽就作为 理所当然的战利品收了下来。再就是磨坊的凯特，她不幸绊倒在一块墓碑 上，碑石勾住她那不曾系住的长袜，于是颠倒了自然的顺序，把她栽个头 朝地脚朝天。贝蒂•派平和她的情人小罗吉尔都栽倒了。古怪的命运！她来 了个嘴啃地，而罗吉却栽个仰面朝天。毛丽在盛怒之下，让铁匠的儿子汤 姆,弗里克也大吃其亏。他是个手艺灵巧的匠人，他做的木套鞋十分出色， 现在把他踏倒在地的那一只正是他自己的杰作。倘若当时他仍在教堂里唱 圣诗，也就不至于落个头破血流了。还有庄稼汉的女儿克罗姑娘、约翰•吉 底士（他自己就是种庄稼的）、南,斯劳赤、爱塞•克德琳、维尔•斯普雷、 汤姆•班乃德、波特家的三姊妹（"红狮"酒店就是她们的父亲开的）、婢女 贝蒂、马夫杰克，以及其他许多出身寒微的人，都七零八落地倒在一片坟 墓中。
这些人并不都是被毛丽那双有力的胳膊打倒的，许多人都是在狼狈鼠 窜中互相撞倒的。
但是这时命运女神担心她过于偏袒一边，有失公允，特别是怕让有理 的一边占了上风，于是赶忙调转过来一一勃朗大娘反攻了。她是塞吉尔•勃 朗宠爱的老婆，同时和教区里一半男人都有勾搭。这个女人在情场上是一 位名手，在战场上也不逊色。她的战绩经常铭刻在她丈夫的脑袋和脸上。 有史以来要是男人曾以绿帽之多炫耀过妻子的多情的话，那就是塞吉尔 了。他那张遍是抓伤的脸上也正标志着这个女人的另一种才能一一或者不 如说，利爪［约。
这位女大力士看到她那一队人马这么丢脸地四散奔逃，再也按捺不 住。她突然停下来，向所有逃跑的人大叫说："喂，你们这些萨默塞特人 ――或者不如说，你们这些萨默塞特女人，叫她这么一个女人把你们吓得 东逃西散的，你们不觉得丢脸吗？要是没人来抵挡她的话，那么我和这儿 的琼•陶普就要拿下这个战功了。"说完这话，她就朝毛丽•西格里姆扑去， 没费多大力气就从她手中夺过那根胯骨，同时，还抓下她头上的帽子。然 后用左手揪住毛丽的头发，右手猛揍毛丽的脸，打得她的鼻子里马上淌下 血来。这时际，毛丽也决不会干等着挨打的。她把勃朗大娘头上那块破布 给扯了下来，然后一只手死死拽住她的头发，另一只手也把敌人打得鼻血 直流。
当两个斗士各自从对方的头上俘获了足够的头发以后，她们的怒火就 转到衣服上来了。在这场进攻中，双方都打得十分猛烈，不上几分钟，两 人的上半身就都扯得一丝不挂了。
幸而女人交手的时候，她们瞄准的方位和男人不一样。但是，尽管在 战斗的开始，她们可能不完全按照女人的打法，而我留意到她们从来不会 忘记袭击对方的胸部的，大多数女人在那里挨上几下就会一命呜呼。我知 道有些人因而认为这是由于女人比男人更嗜血成性。为了使对方流血，她 们总朝鼻子打，那里最容易出血。不过这个说法太勉强，而且也太不厚道 了。
就这部位来说，勃朗大娘却比毛丽占优势，她根本没有乳房。她的胸 部（倘若可以称作胸部的话）的肤色以及其他许多特征都和老羊皮纸一模 —样，你就是在上面擂上一阵，也不会伤着她什么。
毛丽除了肚皮大起来，胸部也大大不同；她很可能惹起勃朗的妒忌， 给她致命的一击。幸而汤姆•琼斯这当儿赶到，立刻结束了这场血战。
这个巧遇理应归功于斯奎尔先生。做完礼拜之后，他带着布利非少爷 和琼斯一道骑马去逛逛。已经走出四分之一哩路，斯奎尔先生忽然改变主 意（他也并非是无缘无故的，个中道理我们等有空再向读者交代），要两 个年轻人陪他走另外一条路，这个提议得到赞同以后，他们就只好又折回 教堂墓地上来。
骑在前边的布利非少爷望见那里聚着一大群人，两个女人正摆出我们 刚才所描述的战斗姿态，就勒住马，查问是怎么回事。一个乡下佬搔着头 皮回答说："知不道，少爷，俺知不道。禀告少爷，好像是勃朗大娘和毛丽, 西格里姆干了一场架。”
"谁呀，谁？”汤姆大声问，可是没等回答，他已经认出他的已变得狼 狈不堪的毛丽，立刻跳下马来，丢开缰绳，翻过墙头，向她奔去。这时， 她才迸出眼泪，对他诉说那些人多么蛮不讲理地欺负她。汤姆一听，忘记 勃朗大娘是个妇道人家，就用马鞭子抽了她一两下一一也许在盛怒之下， 他根本没看出来那是个女人，事实上，除了身上一件衬裙之外，她没什么 女性的样子，而汤姆可能也没理会到衬裙。然后，他就朝着统统被毛丽所 指控的那群人扑过去，他的鞭子像雨点般向四下抽打。除非我再祈求缪斯 来帮忙（好心的读者也许会认为她刚刚为我们出过一番力，那未免使她太 辛苦了），否则我是没法把那天鞭打的情况详细描绘出来的。
像荷马笔下的英雄或者像堂吉诃德以及其他骑士侠客一样把战场上的 敌人全部肃清之后，汤姆就回到毛丽身边。倘若把他看到的她当时那副景 象写出来，不论作者自己或本书读者都会感到很不愉快的。汤姆气得像个 疯子一样捶胸顿足，扯着自己的头发赌咒发誓说，对闹事的人他非狠狠地 报复一番不可。接着，他脱下自己的外衣给毛丽披上，把他的帽子也给毛 丽戴上，用自己的手帕尽量把她脸上的血揩干，然后吩咐仆人去取一副后 鞍或横鞍来，他好把毛丽护送回去。
布利非少爷反对把仆人派走，因为他们身边只有一个仆人；可是斯奎 尔赞成，布利非也只好同意了。
仆人去了不大一会儿就把后鞍取来。毛丽尽可能把被扯碎的长衫整理 一下，就坐在仆人背后，由斯奎尔、布利非和琼斯一路陪着回了家。
琼斯接过自己的衣服，偷偷吻了毛丽一下，悄声告诉她晚上再来，然 后就和她分手，骑马去追他的同伴。
第九章
本章讲一件不很平和的事情
毛丽刚刚换上平素穿的那套破衣裳，她的姐妹们就朝她气势汹汹地扑 过来一一尤其是她的大姐，说毛丽这是活该。"她凭什么大模大样地穿上魏 斯顿小姐送给妈妈的那件长衫！"她说，"要是由咱姐妹中一个来穿的话， 最有权利的也该是我呀！不用说，你一定以为自己长得漂亮，就该穿它。 你大概觉得比我们谁都长得好看！"另一位又嚷道："把碗柜上那块破镜子 拿给她照照。要是我的话，就先洗干净脸上的血，再来谈自己的美貌。"大 姐嚷道："你最好听听牧师讲了些什么，别净追着男人跑。"她母亲哭哭啼 啼地说："孩子，真是这样。她把咱们一家的脸都丢光了。咱家从来也没人 养过汉子。”
"妈，你用不着拿这种话来骂我，"毛丽大声嚷着，"你自己跟爸爸结婚 不到一星期就生下姐姐的。”
"对呀，你这婊子，”她母亲气呼呼地说，"是那样，又有什么了不起 的！横竖我跟你老子正式成了亲。你要是正正经经地嫁了人，我也不会生 你的气。但是你这骚货偏偏跟人家少爷勾搭上了！你一定会养出个野杂种 来的。可是天下没人敢说我这种闲话。”
当黑乔治回来办理前边提过的那件事情的时候，他家里正这么闹得一 塌糊涂。他老婆和三个女儿都同时在嚷着，并且大多是连哭带喊的，他等 了好一阵子才得到说话的机会。他立刻把苏菲亚的话告诉了她们。
西格里姆的老婆听了又重新骂起她的女儿来。"瞧，你害得我们多么为 难！"她说，"小姐瞅见你那大肚子会怎么说呢？我不如早点死了好！”
毛丽趾高气扬地问她父亲说："那么你替我弄到什么好差事了呢， 爹？”（黑乔治并没十分懂得苏菲亚所说的放在她身边服侍的意思。）"大 概是在厨房里当个下手吧。给人家洗盘洗碗的活儿我可不干。我那位少爷 替我安排的比那要好得多。你们瞧瞧今天下午他给我的，他答应永远不让 我缺钱花。妈妈，你要是不多嘴多舌，懂得好歹，你也不会缺钱花的。"说 着她就掏出几枚金币来，给了她母亲一枚。
金子一碰到手心，那位好妇人的性子立刻就温和下来。（这服万应丹 就是如此之灵验！）她说："孩子他爹，世上哪里找你这样的笨蛋，不先问 —声是个什么差事就答应下来！也许真像毛丽说的，是给大师傅当下手
呢。我尽管穷，还有我的身份，不能让我的闺女到厨房去干下贱活儿。虽 然我那个当牧师的爹死的时候欠了一屁股债，连一个先令的遗产也没分给 我，只好将就嫁了个穷光蛋，可是要知道我把志气看得比什么都重要。
哼，魏斯顿小姐最好查查家谱，看看她自己爷爷是干什么的。说不定当我 的先人坐着马车的时候，她的祖宗还靠两只脚走路呢。我估量她送给咱们 那件旧长衫，心里一定觉得做了件了不起的事呢。我娘家的人要是在街上 看到这种破烂，拾也不会拾的。穷人总得受人糟蹋。教区里的人用不着为 毛丽这么大惊小怪。孩子，你尽可以对他们说，你姥姥穿的比这要阔气多 了，样样都是从店里买新的。”
"不过得想想我该怎么回复小姐好呢？"乔治问道。
"我怎么晓得！"她说，"你总是给家里人找种种难题做。你还记得你打 死鹧鸪那回，叫我们遭的殃吗？我不是劝过你，再也别进魏斯顿家的庄园 吗？多年前我不是就告诉过你，这样做对咱们不会有什么好处吗？可是你 总是由着你那牛性子，哼，你这个浑蛋！”
大体说来，黑乔治是个好性子的人，不卤莽，不暴躁。可是也有点古 人所谓的"肝火”。倘若他老婆是个聪明人的话，她也会有所顾忌了。根据多 年的经验，黑乔治懂得家里起风波的时候，用道理去争辩不过是火上浇 油。因此，他手边总预备着一根小鞭子，这是他多次尝试过的灵丹妙药。 如今这声"浑蛋”提醒他又该使用这服药了。
因此，刚一露出大吵的苗头，他马上就拿出上述的药剂。像一切特效 药一样，刚服下时虽然似乎使病症恶化，病情加剧，可是转眼之间一切就 都平静下来，患者随之也完全恢复了宁静。
然而这终究是专给骡马预备的一种药，需要十分壮实的体格才经受得 住，因此，只对一般粗人适用一一除非遇到一种情况，即对方炫耀起自己 的内第来，那时，我们认为任何做丈夫的使用这种药都未可厚非，只要使 用时不要过于下流一一像使用某些这里不须指明的外用药一样，以至于把 使用者的手都玷污了，任何体面人便是想一想如此卑劣下贱的勾当也忍受 不了。
不一会儿，全家又都回到宁静状态。这服药的效力有如电流，往往能 从一个人传到并没触到它的别人身上。老实说，既然二者都是由摩擦而产 生的，它们之间也可能真有些共同之处。弗里克先生那部大著四再版的时 候，很可以对这个问题研讨一下。
于是，他们开起家庭会议来了。经过反复的辩论，毛丽仍然不肯就 任。最后决定由西格里姆的老婆亲自去问候魏斯顿小姐，好歹替她的大女 儿谋得了那个差事，而大女儿也非常乐意。可是命运似乎偏要跟黑乔治一 家为难，这个腾达的想法后来又成了泡影。
第十章
副牧师撒波尔先生讲的故事。乡绅魏斯顿的眼力。他对女儿深厚的 爱以及苏菲亚对他的孝心
第二天早晨，汤姆•琼斯跟魏斯顿先生一道去打猎，回来的时候，乡绅 邀他来家用饭。
这一天，美丽的苏菲亚大放光彩，比平时更加轻快活泼。她的目标所 在当然是我们的主人公，虽然我相信她未必意识到自己的意图。倘若她存 心想让汤姆迷上她的话，那么如今她已如愿以偿了。
同桌吃饭的还有奥尔华绥先生那个教区的副牧师撒波尔先生。他是位 德高望重、脾气温和的人，主要特点是在餐桌上能够一语不发，然而嘴巴 却一刻也不闭上。简短地说，此公有世上头等的好胃口。可是一旦餐布撤 去，他总尽量去弥补适才的沉默，因为他为人心肠好，谈话往往饶有风 趣，从来也不令人讨厌。
他是在烤牛肉刚要端上之前来到的。一进门就声明带来了一条新闻。 他开头讲自己适才是从奥尔华绥先生府上来的。这当儿，他看到烤牛肉端 上来了，马上就一声不响，只顾上念了餐前的祷文，并且宣布他必须向"小 男爵"致敬一一他总是管牛腰部的肉叫作"小男爵”的。
吃完饭，苏菲亚提醒他要讲的那条新闻，于是他就这样讲开了："小 姐，昨天礼拜堂里举行晚祷的时候，我想您一定理会到一个年轻女人穿了 您的一件式样特别的长衫一一我记得看见您穿过这件长衫。不过，这样的 衣裳在乡下却是
Rara avis in terris, nigrcque simillima cygno.
小姐，意思就是说：’世间一珍禽，有如黑天鹅。’这是玉外纳四的一句诗。 还是言归正传吧。我刚才说，那样的衣裳在乡下是很少见的，但也许更令 人感到奇怪的是穿这件衣裳的人。先生，我听说她就是替您看猎场的那个 黑乔治的女儿。我本以为黑乔治已经吃够苦头，理应学点乖，不至于让他 家的浪丫头还穿这种花花绿绿的衣裳了。做礼拜的时候，她在教堂里引起 一片混乱，倘若不是奥尔华绥先生出来制止，礼拜就做不下去了，因为第
一段经文我念到半中间，就给搅得几乎念不下去了。可是祷告结束，我回 家以后，教堂墓地上竟为这事打了起来，闹了不少乱子，其中，一个巡游 各地的提琴手的头部受了重伤。今天早晨他到奥尔华绥先生那里请求拘捕 肇事人，于是，那个浪丫头就给传了去。乡绅的意思本打算替他们和解一 下，可是突然之间那个浪丫头显出（小姐，对不起）马上要养出个野种的 样子。乡绅追问她：胎儿的父亲是谁？但是她死也不肯吭声。我走开的时 候，他正要把这丫头押解到教养所去呢。”
"牧师，原来你带来的新闻只不过是一个骚丫头养私生子的事呀，"魏 斯顿说，"我还以为是什么国家大事、社会要闻呢。”
"这件事确实没什么稀奇，"牧师说，"不过，我还是觉得很值得一提。 至于国家大事，大人您知道得最清楚；我的见闻只限于本教区而已。”
"对，对，"乡绅说，"正像你说的，国家大事我确乎晓得一二。来吧， 汤米，痛痛快快地喝吧，酒瓶就在你跟前。”
汤姆请他原谅，说有件急事去办，就离开了餐桌。乡绅站起来拦他， 汤姆生怕给他拉住，再没说什么客气话就匆忙走了。
汤姆走后，乡绅狠狠地骂了他一声，然后掉过身来对牧师嚷道："我看 出苗头来了，我看出来啦。汤姆准是这个野种的老子。哼，牧师，你还记 得他多么热心地把那个丫头的爹推荐给我吗？他妈的，好一条狡猾的狗。 嗯，一点不差，汤姆就是那个野种的老子！ ”
"要是那样的话，我可真难过，"牧师说。
"有什么可难过的呢？"乡绅嚷道，"这算得了什么大事？难道你还假装 从来没弄出过野种来吗？见鬼，不过你运气更好些罢了！我敢打赌，你一 定不止弄出一个来。”
"您真爱开玩笑，"牧师回答说，"可是我不但因为这是件有罪的行为而 责备他（这当然是应该遭到严重谴责的），我担心他这样胡作非为会损害 奥尔华绥先生对他的好感。老实说，这小伙子生性虽然野点，可是我从不 曾见他干过什么损人的事；除了您刚才提到的这件，我也不曾听说他干过 什么。我确实希望做礼拜的时候，他的应答能更规矩一些，然而整个说 来，我觉得他
Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris.
"小姐，这是一句古诗四，翻译过来就是：’既有坦率的外表，又有坦率的风 度的青年。’这种品格无论在希腊人或罗马人当中都是极受推崇的。在我看 来这位少爷（尽管他是那样的出身，我认为还是应该这么称呼他）是很谦 逊、很知礼的人，要是他失掉奥尔华绥先生的宠爱，我会十分难过的。”
"瞎扯！"乡绅说，"失掉奥尔华绥的宠爱！奥尔华绥自己就爱上过一个 娘儿们。这一带哪个不晓得汤姆是谁的儿子！你这种话只好跟旁人说去。 我还记得奥尔华绥在大学时候的事哩。”
"我还以为他从没上过大学呢，"牧师说。
"不，他上过，"乡绅说，"我们俩一道嫖过许多回婊子。周围五哩地以 内，谁也没他嫖得出名。不会的，你放心，他不会为这件事讨厌汤姆的， 别人也不会。问问苏菲丝，你不会因为一个小伙子弄出个野种来就瞧不起他 吧，姑娘？不，不，女人会反而更加喜欢他的。”
对于可怜的苏菲亚，这句话真问得残忍。当牧师讲这件事的时候，她 就注意到汤姆脸上变了颜色；又加上他那么匆匆忙忙地离席而去，在在都 使她觉得她父亲的揣度是不无根据的。很长一段时间里，她已经断断续续 地看出些蛛丝马迹，这时，隐秘一下子全都揭开了，她发现自己对这件事 极为关切。在这种情况下，苏菲亚的父亲突然问了她那么莽撞的一个问 题，她脸色的变化，让有心人看到，一定会感到吃惊的。可是说句公道 话，乡绅却不是这种人。因此，当他的女儿站起身来对他说，他只需暗示 —下她就会告退的，魏斯顿就让她离开了。然后，他带着十分庄重的神色 说：他宁可看到自己的女儿过于拘谨些，也不愿看到她过于放肆。这个见 解牧师颇为赞同。
于是，乡绅与牧师畅谈起政治来，根据报纸和政论小册子，谈得甚为 精彩。为了国泰民安，他们还一连喝去四瓶酒。接着，乡绅酣睡起来，牧 师点上烟斗，骑着马回家去了。
乡绅睡了半个钟头的觉，醒来之后就喊女儿给他弹琴，可是苏菲亚央 求父亲原谅她，因为那天晚上她的头痛得厉害，魏斯顿立刻答应了。事实 上，苏菲亚不论要求什么，她总用不着说二遍的，因为她父亲十分钟爱 她，他自己总是从满足她的要求中得到极大的快乐。苏菲亚确实是他的小 宝贝，他时常这么叫她，而她也当之无愧。她用极大的孝心来报答他的疼 爱，事事都尽到了做女儿的责任。由于对父亲的爱，使她在尽孝上头丝毫 不感到勉强，而是十分愉快。一个女友曾经笑话她过于重视对父亲百依百
顺的美德（那位小姐这么说），苏菲亚回答说："小姐，您要是以为我在这 件事情上感到自豪，那你可就误会了。我这么做只不过是尽一点做女儿的 责任，而且，我自己也得到很大的快乐。说实在的，天下再没有比增进我 父亲的幸福更能使我高兴的事了。亲爱的，倘若我有什么引以为荣之处， 那也只不过是我有可能尽尽孝道，而不是真的尽了孝。”
然而可怜的苏菲亚今晚是无法享受这份快乐了。她不但要求父亲别让 她给他弹琴，还央求准许她不陪他用饭。这个请求乡绅也答应了，虽然多 少带着勉强；除非他正把心思用在马、猎狗或酒瓶上，否则他轻易不让女 儿离开他的身边一步。不过魏斯顿还是答应了她的请求，虽然这个可怜人 （如果我可以这样说的话）很怕就自己一个人呆着，他因而只得派人请来 邻近一位庄主陪他聊天。
第十一章
毛丽■西格里姆险遭拘捕，以及我们不得不向人性深处探索而得出 的一些看法
汤姆•琼斯那天早晨打猎的时候骑的是魏斯顿先生的马，这样，乡绅的 马厩里没有他的牲口，他只好徒步回家。汤姆走得很快，不到半个钟头就 走了三哩多路。
到了奥尔华绥先生的大门，刚好碰上警长和他手下的差役押解着毛 丽，正要把她带到那个专门惩治下等人的地方，即是说，教下等人懂得尊 敬并服从上等人的地方去；由于在这里必须让他们知道命运在那些有过失 需要惩治和不需要惩治的人们中间树立了怎样一道鸿沟，倘若他们不肯接 受这个教训，那恐怕教养所对他们的德行的改进是不会有什么帮助的。
当律师的或许会认为奥尔华绥先生在这件事情上未免有些越权。老实 说，既然没经正式的控诉手续，我也怀疑他这样做是不是完全合乎手续。 不过，既然他的用意是光明正大的，就理应在foro conscientiae［心上得到 谅解，因为许许多多法官成天都在不按照法律行事，而且还提不出这样的 借口呢。
汤姆一听警长说他们要去的所在（其实，不说他自己也大约猜到 了），就把毛丽搂在怀中，当着大家温柔地拥抱她，发誓说，谁要动她一 动，他就要谁的命。他嘱咐毛丽擦干眼泪，尽管放心；随便她到哪里，他 都陪到哪里。然后用温和的声调吩咐那脱帽在手、战战兢兢地站在一旁的 警长说，先和他一道回到他父亲（那时他就是这么称呼奥尔华绥先生的） 那里，他相信只要他替这姑娘讲几句话，她就一定会被释放的。
倘若汤姆要求警长把毛丽交出来，我想他也准会照办的，因此，他立 刻答应了汤姆的这个请求，大家一起来到奥尔华绥先生的大厅。汤姆嘱咐 他们先在那里稍候一下，他独自去见那位好人。一找到奥尔华绥先生，他 就跪下来，哀求乡绅耐心地听他的陈述，他承认自己是毛丽所怀的那个胎 儿的父亲。他央求奥尔华绥先生怜悯那个可怜的姑娘，在这件事情上如果 有什么罪过，那主要应由他自己一人担当。
"如果有什么罪过！"奥尔华绥很生气地说，"难道你已经浪荡、堕落到 这种地步，连违背天理，破坏法纪，败坏、毁灭一个可怜的姑娘的行为是
否有罪，都不晓得了吗？我当然也认为主要的罪责应由你来担当，这个罪 行太重大了，一定会叫你粉身碎骨的。”
"不管我会遭到怎样的下场，"汤姆说，"我请求您先答应宽恕那可怜的 姑娘吧。我承认我败坏了她，可是她会不会从此身败名裂，那就操在您手 里了。看在上帝的面上，收回您的拘捕状吧。千万别把她送到那个必然使 她遭到毁灭的地方去。”
奥尔华绥吩咐他马上喊个仆人来。汤姆说，用不着了，因为他在大门 口碰到他们，就相信他老人家仁慈为怀，把他们全带到大厅来，听候他最 后发落。他跪着哀求他，从宽发落这个姑娘，让她回到她父母身边，免得 她不必要地遭受更多的耻辱和轻蔑。"我晓得我这个请求太过分了，”他 说，"我晓得罪孽都是我造下的，只要有可能，我一定尽力去改正。您如果 大开恩典，宽恕我这一遭，我决不会辜负您的。”
奥尔华绥犹豫了一下，最后说："好吧，我取消那个下狱令。去把警长 叫来。"警长马上被喊来了，奥尔华绥解除他这个任务，把那个姑娘也放 了。
读者可以想象得到，奥尔华绥先生这时不免要把汤姆严厉训诫一番， 但是我们已经把他对珍妮•琼斯说过的话照实写在第一卷里，那些话大部分 对男女都可适用，这里就省略了。这个年轻人并不是个怙恶不悛的歹徒， 他从这番训诫中深深有所醒悟，就回到房间里，整个晚上都独自在怅惘的 沉思中度过。
琼斯这个过失使奥尔华绥十分生气。尽管魏斯顿先生那么说，这位可 敬的人却从来也没有放纵自己去找女人寻欢作乐，对旁人的荒唐行为他也 是深恶痛绝的。我们有充分理由可以断定魏斯顿先生的话是无稽之谈，他 特别用大学作那些放荡行为的背景，而奥尔华绥先生是从没念过大学的。 原来那位好乡绅有点儿过于喜欢说笑，就是通常所谓的"信口开河”，但是 这里也完全可以另换一个更简短的字眼儿四。这个单音字我们也许常常用旁 的字代替掉了，而实际上，一般所谓的妙语和幽默，严格说来都应该是用 它来称呼比较合适，不过为了符合文雅的风尚，我在此姑且不把它写出 来。
但是不管奥尔华绥先生对这桩或那桩罪过多么憎恶，他的眼睛却不曾 因而被蒙蔽起来，他依然看得见犯过罪的人身上的好的品质，而且看得跟 没掺有罪过的时候一般清楚。因此，他一方面为琼斯这种荒唐行为而震
怒，同时，他对琼斯的真诚坦白、光明磊落也感到满意。现在他心里对这 个青年形成了我想读者也已具有的一种看法：如果把他所犯的错误和他品 质上的优点拿到天平上称一称，后者的分量似乎还要重些。
因此，当布利非先生立刻把这件事一五一+地报告给屠瓦孔之后，屠 瓦孔枉费心机，徒然对可怜的汤姆大肆攻击了一番。奥尔华绥先生耐心地 听完这通咒骂之后，冷冷地回答说：像汤姆这种性格的年轻人往往是会犯 这种过失的。但是他相信汤姆听了他这番教诲，心里必然很受感动，希望 他日后不再重犯了。既然动鞭子的日子早已过去，这位塾师除了使用舌头 ――在报复上那是个软弱无力的工具一一来发泄自己的肝火，再也没旁的 办法了。
斯奎尔虽然没那么激烈，却来得更加狡猾。也许由于他比屠瓦孔更恨 琼斯，所以他使出诡计更加破坏奥尔华绥先生对琼斯的好感。
读者一定还记得第二卷里所写的关于鹧鸪、马和《圣经》等几件小 事。可是那些事情都并没有损害奥尔华绥先生一向对汤姆的钟爱，倒反而 更增加了。我相信无论谁，只要稍稍懂得什么叫友谊、慷慨和宽宏大量， 或者说，只要稍具仁慈之心，也就必然会是这样的。
汤姆的这几件善举在奥尔华绥的崇高心灵上造成了怎样的印象，斯奎 尔也并非不晓得，因为这位哲学家也深知什么是美德，尽管他也许不去身 体力行。至于屠瓦孔，他的头脑里根本没有这种念头一一原因何在，我也 不便断言。他总是从坏的方面去看琼斯，并且以为奥尔华绥也是如此。他 以为奥尔华绥只是由于骄傲和固执，才不肯抛弃他曾爱过的这个孩子，因 为那样他就等于默认自己以前的看法错了。
因此，斯奎尔抓住这个机会，把我们前面所提到的几件事都往坏的方 面去歪曲，想借以击中琼斯的要害。"先生，我很难过，"他说，"因为我不 得不承认我和您一样受骗了。对汤姆的那些举动，我当时总认为是出于一 片友情，因而不能不感到满意。但他做得太过火了，而一切过火的举动总 是荒谬、恶劣的。不过，我总原谅他年纪还轻。咱们当时都以为他是为了 友情才撒了谎，我决没料到实际上他那样做只不过是为了满足堕落无耻的 肉欲。如今您总可以清清楚楚地看穿这个年轻人当时对看猎场的一家人那 片假仁假义是出于怎样的动机了。他周济那个做父亲的，原来是为了好败 坏他的女儿；他维持那一家人的生活，不让他们挨饿，原来是为了把其中 的一个成员引向羞辱和毁灭的道路。这就是他的友情！这就是他的慷慨！
正如理查德•斯梯尔爵士四所说，’出高价购买山珍海味的贪吃的人，也可称 得上是慷慨'哩。一句话，从今以后，我决不再向人性中的弱点让步，也决 不再把那些与正义的无误的规律并不完全相符的行为看作美德了。”
奥尔华绥为人厚道，这种看法他是不会有的；然而当他听到旁人对他 讲这种颇有几分道理的话的时候，他也不能立即断然拒绝。斯奎尔这番话 确实已深深打入他的心中，塾师也清清楚楚地看出了自己的话引起了对方 的不安。不过奥尔华绥先生不肯承认这一点，他只是随口搭讪了几句，就 把话题引到旁的事上去。幸而这番话不是在汤姆获得宽恕之前说的，因为 这话确实使奥尔华绥心上第一次留下了对汤姆的坏印象。
第十二章
一些明白易懂的事情;然而与前一章所叙述的事情同一根源
我相信读者一定乐于同我一道再回到苏菲亚那里去。她前次与我们分 手后，一夜过得很不畅快。既不成眠，自然更无法入梦。早晨，当她的女 仆昂诺尔大姐在平常那个时刻进来服侍她的时候，发现她已经起床，梳洗 完毕。
在乡下，方圆两三哩以内的人就像紧邻一般，谁家有点什么事，一阵 风就传开了。因此，毛丽丢人的丑事昂诺尔大姐全听说了。她又是个嘴巴 快、好饶舌的，一进小姐房间就这么唠叨开了 ：
"呀，小姐，您对这件事情怎么看呢？礼拜天您在教堂里遇到的那个姑 娘，您还认为她长得很漂亮，可是您要是走近了看看的话，就不会觉得她 那么漂亮了，就是那个姑娘，说真的，因为肚子大起来，被送到保安官那 儿去了。我看她是个不知廉耻的贱货，说真的，她咬定孩子是琼斯少爷 的。整个教区都说奥尔华绥先生非常生琼斯少爷的气，不肯理他了。当 然，说真的，谁都会替那个倒霉的年轻人可惜，不过，跟那么下流的女人 去胡搞，也不值得叫人可惜。可是他是个那么漂亮的少爷，要是给赶出大 内，我会很难过的。我敢打赌，那个贱女人一定也一样心甘情愿，她一向 就厚脸皮。遇上这么个不懂得害臊的女人，也就不能净怪小伙子了，说真 的，干出这种事来也是极其自然的。跟这样的肮脏女人去鬼混实在丢身 份，怎么倒霉也是活该。可是，说真的，错儿主要还是在坏女人身上。我 巴不得看到把这种人绑在大车后头，狠狠地给这些贱货一顿鞭子。让这样 的女人去毁掉一个漂亮的少爷，那是太可惜了一一谁也不能不承认琼斯先 生是个漂亮的少爷……”
她正这么喋喋不休地讲着的时候，苏菲亚用从未有过的不耐烦声调对 她大声说："你干吗跟我啰嗦这些？琼斯先生干了什么关我什么事？我看你 们统统是一路货。我看你是因为自己没轮上才这么气愤呢！”
"我自己，小姐？”昂诺尔大姐说，"小姐对我有这种看法，可真叫我难 过。我相信谁也不能这么说我。全世界的小伙子们都见鬼去吧。就因为我 说了一句他长得漂亮吗？人人都说他漂亮，也不单是我。说真的，我可从 没想到，说一个小伙子漂亮就会惹出是非来。但是，说真的，以后我再也
不认为他漂亮了，因为漂亮不漂亮还得看他的行为举止。跟一个讨饭的烂 婊子..”
"别再胡说八道啦，"苏菲亚嚷道，"去看看爹是不是叫我吃饭呢？"
于是，昂诺尔大姐奔出门外，一路上还叽叽咕咕地自言自语着，只听 到"哼，我敢说……"这几个字。
至于昂诺尔大姐该不该受到女主人的话里包含着的那种猜疑，我们也 无法说清，以满足读者的好奇心。不过为了弥补这个缺憾，我们倒想透露 一下苏菲亚的心思。
请读者追忆一下，这位小姐曾在不知不觉中暗暗爱上了琼斯先生。她 自己还没觉察出来，感情就已经很深了。当她刚刚对此有所体会的时候， 满腔欢欣愉快的滋味使她下不了决心去抑制或者驱除它。苏菲亚就这么一 直怀着爱慕之情，从来没有考虑过后果。
毛丽这件事第一次使她猛醒过来。这时她才看到自己感情上的脆弱 处，心下十分怔忡不安；然而这件事也起了一种催吐剂的作用，暂时消除 了她的单相思。药物真灵，就在女仆走开的片刻，一切症候都无影无踪 了。当她父亲打发昂诺尔大姐回来喊她吃饭的时候，她的心情已经完全平 静下来，对琼斯先生丝毫也不在意了。
心病与肉体上的病症在各方面都相仿佛，因此，我们不得不冒昧使用 一些医学上的词句，否则读者就难以理解我们所描述的事情。这些词句本 是医学界所专用的，只好请我们素来深为敬重的医界饱学人士多多鉴谅。
心病与所谓肉体上的病症之间最相像之处，莫过于两者都易旧病复发 这个现象。野心和贪欲这类重病复发的情形格外显著。我认识一个野心勃 勃的人，尽管他在宦途上几番遭受挫败（挫败是医治这种病症的唯一灵 药），后来在参加一次巡回法庭时，却又旧病复发，跟人争夺起陪审长的 职位来。我还听说一个贪心鬼曾极力克服自己的贪欲，并且施舍了许多银 币来安慰自己；然而在临终时际却为了他自己的殡葬事宜大耍手腕，和娶 了他的独生女、承包他的殡仪的女婿谈妥一笔十分合算的交易。
为了严格遵循禁欲派的说法，我们在这里把恋爱也看作一种病症，而 这种病症复发的倾向也同样突出。当前，可怜的苏菲亚就是这般光景。她 再次看到琼斯那小伙子，往日的一切症候就又都恢复如初，她的心在冷一 阵热一阵的情绪下痉挛着。
如今，这位小姐的心境与以前可大大不同了。过去那种甜美的情感现 在变成她胸怀里的一只蝎子。她极力去抵御它，尽她的理智（以她的年龄 而论，她的理智可说强得惊人）所能想出的一切论据来克制、驱除它。她 在这方面做得颇为成功，她希望利用时间和隔绝获得彻底治疗。于是，她 决定尽量避免和汤姆•琼斯见面。为了做到这一点，她打算到她姑母家去小 住，相信她父亲一定会同意的。
可是命运女神偏偏另有打算，一桩意外事立刻把苏菲亚这些计划推翻 ――下一章我们就来叙述这桩事。
第十三章
苏菲亚遭到一件可怕的事故;琼斯的豪侠举动以及此举给小姐带来 的更可怕的后果;讲几句褒奖女性的题外话
魏斯顿先生越来越喜欢他的女儿，甚至他所宠爱的猎犬在他心上也几 乎不得不退居其次；然而他无论如何也不肯丢下猎犬，于是别出心裁地想 了个办法，硬要苏菲亚跟他一道去骑马打猎，这样，既可以不离开他的女 儿，又可以照样享受猎犬的陪伴。
尽管这种过分粗野而且十足男性的游戏，很不投合苏菲亚的性格，她 丝毫也不喜欢，然而她对父亲一向唯命是从，现在除了顺从父亲之外，陪 老人家去打猎她另外还有个用意：她希望由于自己在场，使她父亲不致过 于孟浪，免得常冒跌马丧命的危险。
最不方便之处（要是在从前，这恰恰会诱使她去打猎的），就是时常 会碰到她所决心要避开的琼斯那小伙子。可是行猎的季节已到尾声，她希 望在姑姑家住上几天，就可以说服自己，把这令她苦恼的情感完全摆脱 掉。她相信下个行猎季节再遇到汤姆就什么也不怕了。
行猎的次日，苏菲亚正骑马回家。她那匹烈马本来需要一个比她更精 于骑术的人才能驾驭，骑到离她家不远的地方，这马突然胡蹦乱跳起来， 眼看就要把她抛下来了。汤姆•琼斯跟在后边，相距不远，看到这情景，立 刻飞马赶来搭救。一到跟前，他立刻跳下马，抓住她那匹马的辔头。那野 畜生当即举起前腿站了起来，要把骑在它背上的丽人摔下去。这时，琼斯 用双臂把她抱住。
苏菲亚受惊不小。当琼斯非常关怀地问她伤没伤着时，她一时都回答 不出来。可是过不久她就镇定下来，要他放心，说她一点也没伤着，并且 感谢他的照顾。琼斯回答说："小姐，您没受伤，我就心满意足了。我向您 保证，为了保护您免受极小的风险，我即使会蒙受更大的不幸，也一定毫 不迟疑的。”
"什么不幸？"苏菲亚殷切地问道，"我希望您没伤着吧？ ”
"小姐，您别着急，”琼斯回答说，"您遇到这么大的危险而丝毫没伤 着，真得谢天谢地。和我为您担心的那种不幸比起来，我就是折断了胳 膊，也微不足道。”
苏菲亚马上惊呼起来："您折断了胳膊？可了不得！ ”
"怕是真的折断了，小姐，"琼斯说，"可是让我先来照顾您吧。我的右 臂还能为您效劳，我可以扶您走过这块地，然后没几步就到您府上啦。”
看到汤姆耷拉着左臂，用右臂搀扶着自己，苏菲亚对汤姆折断胳膊一 事深信不疑了。这时，她的脸色比刚才受惊时还要苍白多了。她的四肢颤 抖得厉害，琼斯几乎扶不住她。她那颗心也跳得同样剧烈，她禁不住脉脉 含情地望了他一眼一一如果仅仅是感激和同情交加，而没有第三种更加强 烈的情感的话，无论多么温柔的女性心里也无从产生这样的激情。
这件意外发生的时候，魏斯顿先生的马已跑到前边不远的地方去了， 这时他掉转马头，其余的人也跟了来。苏菲亚立刻告诉他们琼斯折臂的 事，央求他们好生照顾他。本来魏斯顿只见到女儿的马而没见到女儿，心 里很着急；如今听说女儿并没伤着，就别提多么高兴了。他嚷着："我很高 兴没出更大的岔子。要是汤姆的胳膊折断了，咱们找个接骨的大夫替他接 上就是。”
乡绅下马，同他女儿和琼斯一道走回家。要是一个冷眼旁观的路人看 到他们各自的神色，一定会以为应该同情的只是苏菲亚一个：琼斯仅仅折 断了一只胳膊，而救回的却恐怕应该说是小姐的性命，自是兴高采烈；至 于魏斯顿先生，尽管他对琼斯受的伤也并非漠不关心，然而他为了女儿侥 幸脱险而感到的欣喜却大大超过了那种关怀。
苏菲亚凭自己的宽厚心地，把琼斯这个举动看作是一种极其勇敢的行 为，在她心上留下了深刻的印象，因为再没有旁的品质更能使女人对一个 男人倾心的了。倘若一般人的见解可以令我们信服的话，那么这是由于女 人天生的胆怯。奥斯本先生说过："女人胆至小，乃上帝所创造之万物中最 怯懦者也。"驱话不一定真实，却未免过于冒失。我认为亚里士多德在他的 《政治学》一书中，有一段论及女人的话更为公道。他说："夫拘谨与坚强 之标准，男女有别：若男子仅具女子之坚强，则为怯懦；而女子仅具男子 之拘谨，亦可为鲁莽。"四有人认为正因为女子胆量过小，所以她们容易对 勇士倾心。这也未必尽然。贝尔四先生（大约在他的论海伦一文中）认为这 是由于女人酷爱荣誉所致，我想倒更合乎事实。我们可以引证一位最深知 人性的作家电来说明这个见解之可信：当他描绘他的《奥德修纪》中的女主 人公昭——这位坚贞不渝的伉俪之情的伟大典范时，曾把促使她去爱她丈夫 的唯一泉源归之于他那辉煌的业绩四。
不管怎样，总之这件意外在苏菲亚心上发生了强烈的作用，这是不容 置疑的。对这件事作了进一步的了解之后，我确实相信美丽的苏菲亚这时 在琼斯的心上也留下同样深刻的印象。老实说，他已经颇有些时候为苏菲 亚可爱的姿容所吸引而不能自持了。
第十四章
来了一位大夫一一他的手术，以及苏菲亚和她的女仆之间的长篇对 话
大家回到魏斯顿先生的大厅之后，一路上吃力地蹒跚着的苏菲亚就倒 在椅子上，亏了给她服下鹿茸精，喝了点水，才没昏厥过去。等那位找来 替琼斯治病的大夫来到时，她已经基本恢复了。魏斯顿先生认为他女儿这 种症状是由于坠马受惊所致，他劝苏菲亚马上放放血，免得昏倒。这意见 也得到大夫的赞同，他说了一大堆应该放血的道理，举了许多因没放血而 丧命的例子。乡绅听了更加坚持非要他女儿放血不可。
尽管苏菲亚十分不情愿放血（因为我想她认为自己所受的惊吓没有乡 绅或者大夫说的那么严重），可是她马上就依从父亲的吩咐，伸出她那美 丽的胳膊，大夫也做好了动手术的准备。
当仆人忙着准备用具的时候，大夫看出苏菲亚神色之间有些犹豫，认 为必是害怕，就满口宽慰她，告诉她可以放心，不会有丝毫危险。他说， 放血决出不了岔子，除非碰上对外科手术一窍不通的假内行一一意思显然 是说现在完全用不着担心。苏菲亚说她并不担心，并且还说："您就是割断 我的一根动脉，我也一定会原谅您。""怎么，你会原谅他？”魏斯顿大声 说，"你饶他，我可决不饶他。妈的，要是他伤着你一点点，我不把他心脏 里的血放光才怪。"大夫对这些都首肯了，然后动起手来。他的手术果然像 他所说的那么巧妙，而且又那么敏捷，因为他只放了很少一点血。他说， 分几回放要比一次放很多血安全得多。
苏菲亚等胳膊缠好，就回到自己的房间去了，因为给汤姆动手术的时 候，她不愿意在场一一从体统上说似乎也不宜于在场。老实说，尽管没表 示出来，她就是由于怕放血要拖延接骨的时间，才不赞成放血的；因为魏 斯顿在关心苏菲亚的时候就什么也顾不得去考虑了。至于琼斯本人，他"宛 如刻在墓碑上的'忍耐'的化身，默坐着向悲哀微笑"。愈老实说，当他看到鲜 血从苏菲亚那可爱的胳膊里淌出的时刻，他早已忘记自己折臂的事了。
大夫先叫汤姆脱得只剩衬衫，把胳膊完全裸出，然后就开始诊查。他 连拉带拽，痛得汤姆直龇牙咧嘴。大夫望到，就十分惊讶地嚷道："您怎么 啦？我决不会叫您痛的。"然后，他握住那只折断的胳膊，就长篇大论地讲 开了深奥的解剖学，非常仔细地研讨了单折骨和双折骨以及其他琼斯的胳
膊可能折断的方式，并且还恰如其分地说明了哪些方式会比现状好些，哪 些会更严重些。
这篇精心结构的冗长演说虽然引起听者的注意和钦佩，可是并没给他 们很多启发，因为他所讲的，听者确实一个字也不懂。于是大夫就做起手 术来。他虽然先啰嗦了很多，动起手来倒也挺快。
然后，大夫吩咐琼斯卧床静养，并且只许吃稀的。魏斯顿先生非留琼 斯住下不可。
昂诺尔大姐也是在大厅里看大夫接骨的好心人当中的一个。手术一 完，小姐立刻就把她叫去，问她那位少爷的经过怎样。昂诺尔大姐就满口 夸奖起汤姆有多么"豪迈"四一一这正是她所用的字眼。她说："这样的举动 出在那么漂亮的人身上是多么可爱哟。"接着她就更热烈地赞美汤姆容貌的 俊秀，最后还说他的肌肤如何之白。
这段话说得苏菲亚脸上红一阵白一阵的，倘若这个机灵的女仆讲的时 候望一望女主人面孔的话，就一定会理会到的，可是恰好她对面放了一面 镜子，使她能看到自己那副百看不厌的脸容一一当她说话的时刻，她的眼 睛一直也没离开镜中那个可爱的面容。
昂诺尔大姐全神都贯注在嘴里讲着的题目上和眼睛盯着的目标上，这 就容得苏菲亚把心神镇定下来。她对昂诺尔大姐笑笑说，她准是爱上那个 小伙子了。"我爱上了他，小姐？”昂诺尔大姐回答说，"我敢赌咒，小姐， 我向您保证，小姐，我说真话，小姐，我没有！""哎呀，"小姐说，"你就 是爱上了他，也没什么可丢人的。他自然是个漂亮的小伙子。""小姐，您 说的是，"女仆说，"我一辈子从来没见过像他这样漂亮的男人。说真的， 没有。正像您说的，尽管他的身份比我高，爱上他也算不得丢人。说真 的，上等人跟我们当仆人的还不都是娘胎里养出来的。而且说到琼斯先 生，尽管奥尔华绥先生把他栽培成一位少爷，论出身他可比不上我。我家 里虽然穷，我可是正经人家生养的，我爹妈是正式结婚的一一有些人脑袋 抬得挺高，却不敢这么讲。哼，有什么了不起，我的老表！尽管他一身白 皮嫩肉一一确实是从没见过那么白的，可我跟他同样是基督教徒，没有人 敢说我出身卑贱。我爷爷是牧师四，我相信，要是他想到自己的子孙会拾起 毛丽•西格里姆的残羹剩饭，他会十分恼火的。”
苏菲亚也许缺乏足够的勇气把这个女仆的嘴堵住（读者也可以推想那 确乎不是一件容易的事），只好听任她喋喋不休；可是有些话小姐听了实
在刺耳。不管怎样，苏菲亚现在终于止住了她那看来没完没了的胡扯。"你 好大胆子，"她说，"竟敢这么议论我爹的朋友！至于那个下流女人，我永 远不许你再提她的名字。关于那位少爷的出身，无论谁，如果说不出他旁 的短处来，最好就别开口。我希望你以后就这样。”
"小姐，对不起，惹您生了气，"昂诺尔大姐回答说，"我和您一样恨毛 丽•西格里姆。至于讲琼斯少爷的坏话，家里的用人个个可以替我作证，每 逢他们谈到私生子问题，我总袒护他。我对小厮们说，你们要是当得上少 爷，哪个不愿意作私生子呢？我还说，他是一位非常漂亮的少爷，说真 的，走遍天下也找不到像他那样一双雪白雪白的手，一点不差。我还说， 再也找不到像他那么和气，那么好心肠的人了。我还说，家里的用人和四 周的街坊没有一个不喜欢他的。说真的，我可以告诉您点事儿，可又怕惹 您生气。"苏菲亚说："你可以告诉我什么其实，小姐，他也没旁的用 意一一不过我还是不说吧，免得叫您生气。"苏菲亚说："告诉我吧，我立 刻就要知道！"昂诺尔大姐说："上礼拜有一天，我正在做着活儿，他走进 屋来。当时您的手笼正放在椅子上。说真的，他竟把手伸了进去一一就是 您昨天刚给我的那只。我说：’哟，琼斯少爷，您要把小姐的手笼撑大了可 就糟啦！’可他还是不把手拿出来，然后又亲了亲它，说真的，我一辈子也 没见过他那个亲吻法儿。"苏菲亚说："大概他不晓得手笼是我的吧小 姐，您听下去呀。他一遍遍地亲了又亲，说那是世界上顶好看的手笼。我 就说：’少爷，这手笼，您足足看过一百遍啦。’他说：’是的，昂诺尔大 姐。可是在你家小姐面前，除了她本人而外，谁还看得见旁的什么好看的 东西！’不，还不止这一件事。您可别生气。说真的，他没旁的用意。有一 天您给老爷弹琴的时候，琼斯先生正在隔壁房间里坐着。我觉得他怪愁闷 的，就说：’琼斯少爷，您怎么啦？在想什么心事吧！’他好像刚从梦里惊醒 过来似的对我说：’丫头子，当你家天仙般的小姐在弹琴的时候，我还能想 什么呢？'他一面抓住我的手说：’啊，昂诺尔大姐，那个男人该有多么幸福 呀。’然后就长长地叹了口气。我敢发誓，他呼出的气真像一束鲜花那么 香。可是他真没什么坏意思。我希望小姐您一个字也别提，因为他给了我 一个银币，叫我永远不对旁人讲。他还要我对着一本书来起誓一一不过我 想，那准不是一本《圣经》。”
在没有发现比银朱更美的红色之前，我们暂时就不去说这当儿苏菲亚 脸上是怎样红法了。她说："昂一一诺一一尔，我……如果你不再向我提这
件事……也不向旁人提，我决不会给你泄露出去……不，我是说，我不会 生你的气。可是我怕你那舌头呢。好丫头，你会去胡说八道吗？"昂诺尔回 答说："小姐，您放心吧。说真的，我宁可把舌头割掉，也决不愿意叫您生 气。您不叫我说出去的话，我准一个字也不露。"苏菲亚说："那么以后再 不许你提这件事啦。尽管我相信琼斯先生就像你所说的，并没什么用意， 可要是传到我爹的耳朵里，他一定会生琼斯先生的气。我自己也要生气 的，如果我认为他……"昂诺尔说："不，小姐，我相信他没什么用意。我 觉得他说话的时候有些恍恍惚惚的，他自己也承认是不知不觉地说出来 的。我说：’是的，少爷，我相信您是这样。’他说：’对，昂诺尔。’可是请 小姐原谅我。我宁愿拔掉舌头，也不愿意叫您生气。"苏菲亚说："你就说 下去吧。你还有什么没告诉我的，就全都说出来吧。皿他说：’对，昂诺 尔，’(这是在他给了我那个银币以后过了些时候说的)’我既不是个花花公 子，也不是那样的无赖，除了把她当作天仙来崇拜之外还能存什么旁的心 思！只要我还有一口气，我就永远把她当作天仙来敬仰、崇拜。’小姐，我 向您发誓，我能记得的就是这些。我本来也挺生他的气，后来我发现他并 没什么恶意我才罢休。"苏菲亚说："昂诺尔，我相信你对我真不错。前一 回你惹恼了我，我才警告了你。你要是愿意留在我这儿，就留下吧。"昂诺 尔说："说真的，小姐，我永远也不愿意离开您。说真的，您那天对我下警 告的时候，我几乎把眼珠子都哭出来了。要是我想离开您，我就是忘恩负 义，因为我再也找不到这么好的差使啦。真的，我愿意跟小姐同生共死。 可怜的琼斯少爷说得好：那个男人该有多么幸福呀……”
说到这里，吃饭铃打断了她们的谈话。这段谈话在苏菲亚身上引起很 大的反应，那天早晨放血的好处远比她当时所意识到的还要大得多。至于 她当前的心境，我要谨遵贺拉斯的准则：既然没有希望描绘得惟妙惟肖， 就索性不去描绘了。她当时的心境大部分读者都不难摹想得出的，至于少 数读者摹想不出，即使替他淋漓尽致地描绘出来，他也依然不能了解，或 者至少不会认为那是合乎情理的。

第五卷
比半年略长些的时间内发生的事
第一章
谈谈作品中的“严肃”部分，以及为什么要谈这个问题
在这一部篇幅极大的作品里，大概读者读来最不感兴趣的部分，正是 作者写来最费力的部分。冠在每卷故事之前的这些短论大抵就是如此。而 我们肯定这些短论对我们首创的这种文体却是必不可少的。
我们并不认为有必要列举理由来说明为什么要这样肯定。只要说明我 们立下了这么一条规矩，凡是散文体喜剧性史诗都必须遵守，这就尽够 了。今天大家已经公认诗剧中的时间或地点都必须严格一致七 谁又曾问过 这原则是根据什么理由建立的呢？有谁向批评家提出过这样的问题：何以 一出戏只能包含一天而不能包含两天的事？或者，何以观众（假定他们也 能像选民一样免费旅行的话）只能随剧情跑到五哩路外去，却不能到五十 哩路以外去？哪一位评论家曾经好好解释过：何以一位古代批评家⑵规定每 出戏不多不少只能是五幕？或者，当今又有哪一位曾试图解释一下：近来 我国剧评家使用的"低级”这个字眼到底有什么涵义？他们就是利用这个字 眼得心应手地把舞台上的一切幽默扫荡得一干二净，使舞台变得和客厅一 般枯燥无味。世人仿佛总乐于遵守这么一条箴言：cuicunque in arte suaperito credendum est[3]o因为如果一个人没有丝毫根据，竟敢贸然替 某种艺术或科学定出武断的法则，那似乎是很难想象的。因此，每遇这种 情况，我们往往就认为那些法则骨子里必有其充分道理，只不过不幸我们 琢磨不透而已。
老实说，世人对批评家实在恭维过了头，把他们看作比实际上要深奥 得多。受到这种推崇之后，批评家才胆敢独揽大权，一跃而为大师，俨然 为作家们订立种种法则，而那些法则还是他们从过去的作家那里承受下来 的。
正确地看来，批评家只不过是个文书而已，他的职责不外乎誉录大法 官所制定下来的规章法则。那些大法官才气横溢，因而成为他们所领导的 各门学术的立法者。古代批评家所企望的，顶多就是文书这个职务。他们 提出的判决都是以法官的决定为依归；没有法官的决定，他们什么也不敢 提。
但是日久天长，由于历代人们的愚昧无知，文书逐渐窃取了法官的权 力，篡夺了上司的权威。从那以后，写作的法则就不再建立在作家们的创
作实践上，而建立在批评家的发号施令上了。文书变成了立法者，当初那 些只管誉写的，如今却断然制定起法律来了。
因此就产生一种显而易见的一一也许还是无可避免的错误：这些批评 家能力都极浅薄，很容易把区区的形式误认作实质。他们的做法一如死抠 法律字句而不去领会其精神的法官，把大作家也许是信笔拈来的一鳞半爪 当作他的主要论点，要后世作家们一律奉为金科玉律。时光的推移和人们 的愚昧一一欺骗的两大支持者，又助长了这些批评家们所篡夺的权威；于 是就规定下一大堆如何写出好作品的规则，尽管这些不论在道理上或实际 生活中都丝毫找不到根据，而且一般只不过起抑制和拘束天才的作用而 已，就像关于舞蹈艺术的许多出色的论文中，倘若立下这么一条主要规 则：舞者脚上一律必须戴铁链，势必使舞蹈大师也无从施展其才艺。
因此，为了避免受到指责，说我们只根据ipse dixit[4]的权威（老实 说，我们对这种权威并不十分敬重）就为后世制定下金科玉律；我们将放 弃上述那种特权，一径向读者说明我们何以要在本书进程中插入这些题外 短论的道理。
在这里，我们必须为知识开辟一条新的途径，纵使有人发现过它，就 我们的记忆所及，从古到今却还没有哪位作家进行过探讨。这条途径不外 乎是对比。它作用于宇宙万物，我们对天然美或人工美的观念，也许在很 大程度上都是靠它来形成的；因为任何事物的美与卓越之处，除了它的反 面还有什么能把它显示出来？就如白昼及夏日之美，正由于黑夜及冬天之 可怖而相得益彰。倘若有可能让一个人只见到白昼及夏日的话，我相信他 对二者之美的概念必然很不完整。
不必讲得这么一本正经吧。您能够不相信吗：世上最标致的女人在一 个从没见过其他类型女人的男子眼里，也要失去她大部分的魅力？妇女本 身对这一点似乎特别敏感，所以她们总煞费苦心地找陪衬一一不，她们甚 至拿自己当陪衬也在所不辞。我曾经注意到（特别在巴思），她们在早晨 总尽量显得很难看，为的是好衬托晚上她们所要显示的美。
绝大多数艺术家在实践中都运用这个诀窍，尽管有些人也许并没怎么 研究过它的理论。珠宝商懂得最精美的宝石需要垫上底箔；画家由于笔下 的人物映衬，往往获得很高的赞赏。
我们中间一位伟大天才可以充分说明这一点。我不能泛泛地把他放在 任何一类普通的艺术家当中，因为他有资格列为：
Inventas qui vitam excoluere per artes.
用自己创造的艺术丰富人生者。［5］
这里，我指的就是所谓英国哑剧［6］这一绝妙娱乐的创始人。
这种娱乐包含两个部分，创始人用严肃和诙谐这两个名称来区别。在 严肃部分里，出现一些异教神祇和英雄，都是观众在舞台上看到的最蹩 脚、最枯燥乏味的角色。然而（很少人懂得个中奥秘）这样做实际上正是 为了衬托这场娱乐的诙谐部分，以便丑角的把戏更显得精彩。
这样使用正角未必十分礼貌，可是无论如何这种安排总算别出心裁， 而且也有效果。如果我们用“比较枯燥”和"顶枯燥”来代替"严肃”和“诙 谐”，也许更加清楚些一一毫无疑问，哑剧里的诙谐部分比舞台上的任何表 演都要枯燥些，只有在那最枯燥的严肃部分的对照之下，才显出些诙谐味 道。真的，那些神祇和英雄严肃得叫人受不了，以致观众总是欢迎丑角 （但是叫这个名字的英国绅士和法国同行毫无关联，他生性要严肃得多） 的出现，因为这下才好摆脱那些更加枯燥的角色。
贤明的作家一向运用这种对比的手法，效果极好。贺拉斯竟然谴责荷 马使用这种手法，曾使我感到惊讶，可是他紧接着在底下一行就自相矛盾 起来了 ：
Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus ； Verum opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum.
当然，大诗人荷马打瞌睡的时候，我也不能忍受； 不过作品长了，瞌睡来袭，也是情有可原的。［7］
有些人也许会认为作家在从事写作的时际，会真的打起瞌睡来，我们 可不要这样来理解这句话。诚然，读者很容易遭到睡魔的侵袭，然而即使 像欧尔德米克孙［8］写的那样冗长的作品，其作者在撰写时也还是兴致勃勃， 毫无倦意的。正像蒲伯先生所说的：
他自己不睡，好让读者打瞌睡。［9］
老实说，那令人欲睡的部分正是一些严肃的场面，是巧妙地穿插进 去，以便与其余部分形成对照，并予以衬托的。这也是已故的某诙谐作家 一段话M的真谛，他写道：他的作品中，凡是使读者感到索然寡味的地方， 也正是他别具匠心的所在。
愿读者根据这种高见一一或者不如说，根据这种低见，来品评这些卷 首短论吧。这段话交代清楚之后，倘若读者认为在这部历史的其他部分 中，也足可以找到严肃的东西，那么就不妨把这些我们已言明在先故意写 得枯燥乏味的短论跳过去，此后每卷径直从第二章读起。
第二章
琼斯先生卧病期间许多朋友来访;用细腻的笔触描绘一下肉眼难以 察觉的爱情
汤姆•琼斯卧病期间，不少人前来问候，虽然其中有些人他也许并不很 喜欢。奥尔华绥先生几乎天天都来看望他。尽管他可怜汤姆所遭受的痛 苦，并且大大赞赏他这种侠义行为，他认为还是应该乘他养病的机会，劝 导他好好反省一下自己的过失，在病中，心灵由于创痛而趋于平和，同 时，面临生命威胁，也就不会为七情六欲所牵扯了。这是对他进行药石之 言最恰当不过的时机。
因此，每逢这位好心人单独和汤姆在一起的时候一一特别是当这年轻 人心情十分宁静的时候，奥尔华绥总乘机提醒他往日不端的行为，然而态 度极其亲切温和，用意无非是要他以后多加小心。奥尔华绥说，汤姆今后 的幸福就全看他能不能幡然改过了；只要他今后不再失掉义父对他的好 感，他还是可以指望得到宠爱的。至于过去的一切，他说都可以一笔勾 销，不再计较。所以他劝汤姆要好好利用这次的不幸，这样，最后会证明 天降下这场灾祸正是为了叫他改邪归正。
屠瓦孔来得也颇勤，他也认为病榻是施教的方便场所。不过，他的教 导法比奥尔华绥的要严厉得多。他告诉他这学生应当把折臂看作上帝对他 的恶行的惩罚；他应当每天跪下来衷心感谢上帝仅仅让他折断胳膊，而没 折断脖子。他还说，脖子留待将来折断，而且为期也许不会很远的。屠瓦 孔还说，他一直奇怪上帝何以没早些惩罚琼斯。不过从这件事情上看，上 帝的惩罚来得虽慢，倒是毫厘不爽的。因此，他还劝汤姆对日后还会有更 大的灾难等待着他这一点，要深信不疑；只要他再有罪过，灾难就必然会 降临。"要想避免灾难，"他说，"只有靠真诚彻底的忏悔。然而像汤姆这样 年纪轻轻就如此堕落的人，心灵恐怕已经完全败坏，无从忏悔了。然而， 我的责任就是劝你去悔过，尽管我早已料到一切劝导都无济于事。不过， liberavi animam meam[ii]就是了。尽管我以极大的关怀眼睁睁地望着你 在阳世必然走向厄难，到了阴间也必然会下地狱，可是我扪心自问，对你 不曾疏忽。”
斯奎尔说的完全是另外一套。他说：断了根把骨头这件小事值不得聪 明人在意。只要想到这种不幸也常降在最聪明的人身上，而且毫无疑问是
为了全人类的幸福，我们就蛮可以处之泰然。把这种在道德上并没有不适 当性的事说成是恶行，只不过是在乱用字眼，这里根本不缺少道德上的适 当性。这种不幸的后果，充其量只不过是疼痛而已，而疼痛是世界上最微 不足道的事。他还说了许多从西塞罗的《图斯库卢姆谈话录》0第二卷和伟 大的夏弗茨贝利勋爵珥的著作里引用来的话。这些话他讲得如此起勤，有一 天不幸咬破了自己的舌头；这样一来，不但打断了他的宏论，并且使他十 分激动，以致嘟嘟嚷嚷地骂了一两声。可是最糟糕的是屠瓦孔这时也在 场，他一向总把这类言论看作异端邪说，这下子他可以借机批评斯奎尔几 句了。他说的时候还带着恶意的嘲笑。那位哲学家咬破舌头，本来已经很 懊丧，听了屠瓦孔这话，就更加气得昏头昏脑（如果可以这么说的话）。 他虽然不能用嘴来发泄怒气，却很可能采取更剧烈的手段来报复；亏得外 科医生在场，他不顾本人利益，出面制止，使事情平息下来。
布利非先生不常来探望他的朋友琼斯，而且从不一个人来。但这位可 敬的年轻人口头上对琼斯表示十分关怀，还为他折臂的事担心；不过他极 力避免和琼斯有亲密的往来，唯恐（像他时常所隐隐表示的）玷污了他那 谨慎持重的品格，因此，他嘴上常挂着所罗门那句不可与恶人交往的箴 言。他倒不像屠瓦孔那样偏激，他对汤姆的改邪归正总还抱着一线希望。 他说："这个人只要还没堕落到不可救药的地步，他舅父所表现的无与伦比 的仁慈就会使他回心转意的。"不过，他最后还说："倘若琼斯先生以后再 闹乱子，我可就不能替他说一个字的好话啦。”
至于乡绅魏斯顿，除非他去打猎或是饮酒，不然的话他几乎寸步不离 病房，有时候他甚至到病房里去饮酒，要是没人使勤拦住，他还要逼着琼 斯奉陪一一这位乡绅夸起酒能医治百病的灵效来，比个江湖郎中吹嘘万应 药丹还来得没边没际。照他说来，酒比药铺里所有的药都更有奇效。不 过，经过多次请求，他终于同意不对琼斯使用这味药了，可是要想叫他早 晨出发行猎时别在病人窗下吹号角（就像恋人在姑娘窗下弹唱一样），那 却怎么也办不到。无论魏斯顿走到哪里，他总先嚷一声"呼啦”;去看琼斯 的时候他也改不了这个习惯，不管那时病人是睡着还是醒着。
这种大声大气并不含什么恶意，对谁也没什么影响；及至他一能坐起 来了，乡绅就带苏菲亚来问候他，因此他可以和苏菲亚在一起了，这对他 来说可真是一个大喜过望的补偿。过了不久，琼斯也能坐在琴旁听她弹奏 了。苏菲亚总是高兴地一连弹上好几个钟头，用最优美的乐曲使他心荡神
驰，一直弹到乡绅认为应该打断她了，而一定要她弹《老西蒙爵士》和他 心爱的其他曲调。
尽管苏菲亚对自己的一举一动十分注意，可是她时而仍不免泄露出一 些心事来，因为爱情在这一点上也有如疾病，从这里找不到出路，它就会 从那里冒了出来。这样，她嘴里瞒住不说的一切，都由她的眼睛、颊上的 红潮以及许许多多不由自主的小动作表露出来了。
有一天苏菲亚正在弹琴，琼斯在一旁听着。乡绅走了进来，大声嚷 着："嗨，汤姆，我为了你，在楼下跟那个笨牧师屠瓦孔干了一架。他当着 我面对奥尔华绥说，折断胳膊是上帝对你的惩罚。我说：他妈的，那怎么 会是惩罚呢？难道他不是为了保护一个年轻姑娘才这样的吗？惩罚！真是 胡说八道！哼，这孩子要是以后再也不出岔子，全国随便哪个牧师也没有 他升天堂升得快！这件事他只应该引以为荣，而没什么丢脸的。”琼斯 说："先生，这件事我既不应该引以为荣，也谈不上丢脸。可是如果我真是 救了魏斯顿小姐的话，我将永远认为那是我一生最大的幸运。"乡绅 说："他还因此在奥尔华绥面前说你的坏话！他妈的，牧师身上要不是穿着 他那件衬裙，我得狠揍他一顿。孩子，我是真心疼你。要是有什么能替你 尽力的地方而不尽力，叫我天打雷劈。明天早晨你到我的马棚里来，除 了'骑士'和'斯劳赤小姐'这两匹马，随你挑一匹骑去吧。"琼斯谢绝了乡绅这 番赠予。"那么你要苏菲骑的那匹栗色马吧，"乡绅说，"我花五十金币买下 的，今年春天才满六岁。"琼斯激动地大声说："哪怕值一千金币，我也宁 愿拿它去喂狗！"魏斯顿说：“得了 ！得了 ！怎么！就为它摔伤你的胳膊 了?要忘记，要原谅！要是生一个哑巴畜生的气，那还成什么男子汉 啦！"说到这里苏菲亚插了进来，请她父亲听她弹琴一一这样的请求他是从 来也不会拒绝的。谈话就这么结束了。
在这段谈话进行的时候，苏菲亚的脸上不止一次变了颜色。琼斯何以 那么痛恨那匹马，她的看法可能和她父亲不同。这时，她的心情显然十分 激动，而且琴弹得那么糟，倘若魏斯顿先生不是马上打起瞌睡，他一定会 觉察出来的。然而琼斯是足够清醒的。他不但眼睛看得清楚，耳朵也听得 分明，所以他多少有所察觉。再加上以前发生的（读者也许还记得）一些 情节，这样，当琼斯对这一切寻思一番之后，便深深相信苏菲亚那温柔的 胸怀并不是平静的。许多年轻读者定然会感到非常奇怪，汤姆何以没有更
早得出这个看法？老实说，他过于迟疑不决，所以看不到小姐对他表露的 情怀一一这种缺憾只有依靠眼下盛行的早期城市教育可以弥补。
当琼斯完全意识到这一切的时候，他的心里面翻腾起来。倘若品格没 有他这么纯洁坚定，在他这般年纪上很可能带来极为危险的后果。他真正 懂得珍视苏菲亚。他十分喜爱她的容姿，也钦佩她的才识，深深地爱着她 的善良。事实上，由于他从不曾起过占有苏菲亚的念头，也从不曾稍稍听 任自己去怀有这种念头，所以他一向对苏菲亚的爱慕要比他所意识到的强 烈得多。这时，他对一切隐谜恍然大悟了，同时他确信他所崇拜的那个人 儿是和他心心相印的。
第三章
一切没有心肝的人会认为本章所写的事只不过是庸人自扰
读者或许料想此刻琼斯的胸膛里必然回荡着一片欣喜、甜蜜之感，使 得他心情欢畅而宁静，不会引起任何我们前边提过的那些危险的后果。然 而事实上这类感觉不管多么甜美，初次出现时总是令人不安的，很少使人 陶醉。况且在当前的情况下，又有某些情节使这种感觉带有苦味，这样， 和甜美之感混合起来就形成一种甜中带苦的饮料。正如甜中带苦的食品不 合人们的胃口，甜中带苦的感觉对于心灵也是有损无益的。
首先，尽管汤姆根据自己的观察，有充分理由认为苏菲亚对他抱有好 感，然而他会不会是把同情（或者充其量是尊敬）误当作一种更为强烈的 感情了，这一点他却没有把握。他决不那么乐观地相信苏菲亚对他已经有 了情意，只需加以必要的鼓励和培植，就会得到他所想望的收获。况且纵 然他的幸福在女儿这方面受不到阻挡，他算定她父亲那一关必然也通不 过。尽管在游乐上头魏斯顿是个土乡绅，然而一牵涉到财产，他却十分世 故。他非常疼爱自己的独女，每逢酒意正浓的时候，往往表示以看到苏菲 亚嫁给他们那一郡里一位大阔佬为生平乐事。琼斯并不是那么一个不自 量、没头没脑的浪荡哥儿，竟因为魏斯顿说过器重他的话就指望乡绅会放 弃要让女儿高攀的想法。他十分清楚，财产即使不是唯一的条件，通常也 是最主要的条件，连最贤明的父母也是要考虑到的。友情固然会促使我们 热切关怀旁人的利益，然而对于满足朋友在感情上的需要，总是十分冷淡 的。说真的，要体会这种满足给人带来的幸福，必须我们自己具有那种热 情才行。既然现在不可能得到苏菲亚父亲的同意，他想：倘若不管乡绅同 意与否自行其是，从而破坏了魏斯顿先生毕生的宏愿，那就太辜负他殷勤 招待的厚情了。而且也太对不起乡绅不断加于他的许多小恩小惠了（尽管 乡绅的态度不免粗暴一些）。想到这一点，他已经觉得未免可鄙，因而不 寒而栗。再一想到奥尔华绥先生，他就更加震惊万分。奥尔华绥对他的恩 情已胜过生父，仅仅对他尽做儿子的孝道是远远不够的。他深深知道那位 好心人最憎恨卑劣和不义的行为，谁要是稍稍朝这方面试探一步，那个人 在他的眼里就永远是可憎的目标，那个人的名字在他耳里就永远是可厌的 声音。不管汤姆多么渴望能成功，眼前这些无法克服的困难就足以使他沮 丧绝望。况且他的愿望还为他对另一个女人的怜悯所束缚。可爱的毛丽的
身影这时蓦然跃上心头。在她的拥抱中，他曾发誓永不变心，她也经常赌 咒说，如果汤姆丢了她，她决活不下去。这时，毛丽以最可怕的姿势死去 的样子一幅幅出现在他眼前，他甚至想到毛丽可能去卖淫而遭到种种痛 苦，而他始而诱奸了她，继而又遗弃了她，是要负双重责任的。他很清楚 她所有的邻居一一甚至她的亲姐妹都多么恨她，多么急于把她撕成碎片。 说实在的，他不但为她招来耻辱，更为她招来了妒忌一一或者不如说，由 于妒忌才招来耻辱，因为许多女人骂她是婊子，实际上她们妒忌她的情人 和她那些讲究的衣饰，巴不得也能出同样的代价弄来。他预见到倘若遗弃 了这个可怜的姑娘，她的毁灭势必随之而来。一想到这一点，他的心感到 刺痛。他认为一个人的贫穷和困苦并不给予任何人随便加深其不幸的权 利。她出身穷苦不曾使得她的遭遇在汤姆眼中显得无足轻重，也不能用以 辩护或甚至减轻他害她遭受痛苦的罪愆。但是何必谈辩护呢？他自己的心 就不允许他毁掉一个他认为爱着他、并且为了这份爱情而牺牲自己清白之 身的人。他那颗善良的心为毛丽申诉一一不是作为一个冷酷的、唯利是图 的律师，而是作为与这事息息相关的辩护者；这颗心深切地分担着自己所 加于对方的一切痛苦。
这位雄辩有力的律师把可怜的毛丽可能陷入的各种不幸描绘得足以引 起琼斯的同情之后，就又巧妙地求助于另外一种情感：用青春、健康和美 貌等等可爱的色彩把那姑娘描绘得十分迷人；又因为她同时还引人怜悯， 至少在好心肠的人眼中就更加迷人了。
可怜的琼斯就这样百感交集，辗转不眠，度过了漫长的一夜。第二天 早晨，考虑的结果是，他决定仍旧守着毛丽，不再去想念苏菲亚。
第二天，从早到晚，他都在牢牢遵守这个仁义的决定：一心怀念着毛 丽，尽量把苏菲亚从脑海里排出。可是就在那决定命运的晚上，一件微不 足道的事却使得他的情绪重新波动起来，内心发生的变化是如此之大，我 们认为理应在新的一章里来叙述。
第四章
短短的一章，其中包含一件小事
这位少爷卧病期间，昂诺尔大姐也是常常前来探望的一位。读者如果 想起她以前对苏菲亚说的一些话，也许会以为她自己对琼斯先生就特别怀 有好感，其实，并没有这么回事。汤姆是个漂亮小伙子，这类人，昂诺尔 大姐总是有几分看重的，然而对汤姆也并没什么特殊的地方。原来她在恋 爱场中栽过跟头：她曾经爱上了某贵族的跟班，那人答应和她结婚，又卑 鄙地遗弃了她。从那以后，她紧紧守住她那颗残破的心，任何男子也休想 得到一星半点儿。对所有的漂亮男子，她一律表示敬重，持有好感，正如 庄重而有道德的人看待一切善良人那样。她真可称作爱男子的人，就像苏 格拉底是爱人类的人：她特别喜欢生得漂亮的男子，就如苏格拉底特别喜 欢心地纯良的人一样；不过她从没听任这种偏爱在她那哲人般的宁静的心 里引起任何波动。
前一章里我们已经看到琼斯先生内心里矛盾重重，第二天昂诺尔大姐 来到他的房间，看到他独自一人，就这样说开了 ："哟，先生，您猜我上哪 儿去啦？我敢打赌，就是五十年您也休想猜得出。可是即使您猜得出，说 真的，我也不能告诉您。"琼斯说："如果你不能告诉我，我倒非要知道不 可。我相信你不至于那么残忍，偏不告诉我吧。"她大声说："讲到这儿， 我也不晓得为什么非不告诉您，因为您当然不会讲给旁人听的。并且即使 您知道我到什么地方去了，如果您不知道我是干什么去的，那也白搭。 哎，我也不懂为什么一定要把这件事当个秘密。因为她肯定是天底下最好 的小姐了。"听到这话，琼斯就恳切地央求她道出那个秘密，并且答应决不 外泄。于是，她又这么说下去："您知道，小姐派我探望毛丽•西格里姆去 了，看看那个骚丫头缺点什么。说真的，我是不高兴去的，可是当仆人的 得听主人吩咐呀！琼斯先生，您怎能那么不顾身份啊！小姐叫我拿些内衣 和旁的东西送给她。小姐可真是太好了。把像毛丽那样乱来的骚货送到教 养所去，对她们是有好处的。我对小姐说：您这可是姑息懒人……”琼斯 说："我的苏菲亚有多么好心肠呀！"昂诺尔说："嗬，我的苏菲亚！您真叫 得出！嘿，要是您什么全晓得了……说真的，琼斯先生，我要是您的话， 我决不会看得上毛丽•西格里姆这样的下贱货的。"琼斯说："你说'要是您什 么全晓得了'，这话指的是什么？"昂诺尔回答说："指的就是那个。您不记
得有一回您把手伸到小姐的手笼里的事了吗？说真的，我倒蛮想把什么都 说出来，就只怕会传到小姐的耳朵里去。”于是琼斯连连认真赌咒，然后昂 诺尔就接着说："说真的，本来小姐已经把那只手笼给了我，后来，一听到 您曾经把手伸了进去……”琼斯插嘴说："那么你把我干的事都告诉了 她？”她回答说："如果我告诉了她，您也用不着生我的气。为了让小姐知 道这种事，多少男人掉脑袋也是心甘情愿呢。要是他们晓得……说真的， 全英国最神气的贵族也会感到自豪的……不过，说真的，我真不想告诉 您。"琼斯一再央求她，一会儿工夫就把她说服了，她又这样说下去："您 一定晓得，那只手笼小姐已经给了我，可是我把那事告诉她以后，过了一 两天，她挑起新手笼的毛病来一一说真的，那只手笼再漂亮不过了。她 说：’昂诺尔，这手笼讨厌得很，太大了，我戴着不合适。你先把那只旧的 还给我，等我再去弄一只：这新的你用吧。’小姐是好心人，既然把东西给 了人，自然不肯再要回去。说真的，我当然把那旧的又还给她了。我相信 她一直戴在手上，我敢说她背地里一定吻过它多少遍呢。”
谈到这里，魏斯顿先生走来把话打断了。他是来喊琼斯去听苏菲亚弹 琴的。可怜这个年轻人跟着他，脸色苍白，浑身颤抖。魏斯顿注意到他这 神情，可是看到昂诺尔大姐，就错疑到旁处去了。他半认真半开玩笑地骂 了汤姆一声，要他到别的地方去打野食，可不许在他家的禁地上偷猎。
这天晚上苏菲亚显得格外美丽，她右腕上恰好套着那只手笼，我们相 信，在琼斯眼里那也替她增添了不少魅力。
苏菲亚正在弹着她父亲所喜爱的一支曲子，乡绅倚着她的椅背。这 时，手笼忽然从她手上滑落下来，琴声戛然停住了。这使得乡绅十分恼 火。他抓起手笼，狠狠地咒骂了一声，就把它丢到火上。苏菲亚马上跳起 身，一把从火里把它抢了出来。
尽管这件小事在许多读者看来恐怕是微不足道的，然而在可怜的琼斯 身上却起了重大影响，所以我们认为应当把它叙述一下。事实上，没有脑 筋的史家往往略过许多细微末节，而极其重大的事件恰好是从这些细微末 节里产生出来的。我们确实可以把世界看作一架庞大的机器，大齿轮原本 是由极小的齿轮，小到只有最锐利的眼睛才能看见的齿轮带动的。
因此，以苏菲亚的天姿国色，以她那双眼睛里的灿烂光辉和无限柔 情，以她那悦耳的嗓音和苗条身材，以她的机智、好脾气、宽厚的心肠和
温柔的性格，也不能像手笼这件小事那样绝对征服和占有可怜的琼斯那颗 心。诗人就是这样娓娓动听地咏过特洛伊的：
---Captique dolis lachrymisque coacti Quos neque Tydides, nec Larissaeus Achilles, Non anni domuere decem, non mille Caring.也］
不是狄俄墨得斯，也不是忒提斯的阿喀琉斯［15］ 不是千艘兵船，也不是十年围攻， 而是假的泪和甜言蜜语攻下这城池。
琼斯先生所固守的碉堡这时也出其不意地被攻陷了。尽管我们这位主 人公最近在兵法上煞费苦心，将为人要持重，要讲究道义这些考虑布满在 通往他心灵的一切要道上作为岗哨，可是这一下所有的哨兵都弃岗而逃， 爱神在凯歌声中长驱直入了。
第五章
十分长的一章，包含着一桩十分重大的事件
胜利的爱神虽然没费吹灰之力就把它的决心顽抗的敌人从琼斯心头赶 走，然而要拔除琼斯早先在那里布下的岗哨可就没那么容易。且把这些比 喻放在一边，为毛丽命运的担忧使这位可敬的青年大感困惑，惴惴不安。 苏菲亚卓绝的才姿已经压倒了一一或者不如说，消灭了那个可怜的姑娘一 切可爱之处，然而取爱情而代之的是怜悯而不是轻蔑。琼斯深深相信毛丽 已经把她的全部爱情和她一生的幸福都寄托在他一人身上了。他知道，她 所以如此，是由于他爱她爱得无微不至，并且曾多方使她相信永远不会变 心。在毛丽那方面，她也表示对汤姆的诺言深信不疑，并且极其庄重地对 他发誓说，她感到自己是女人中最幸福的还是最悲惨的，就要看他履行不 履行他的诺言了。由自己一手造成一个同类最悲惨的一生一一这在他真是 想都不敢想的。他认为这个可怜的女人已经为他牺牲了她的微薄力量所能 牺牲的一切。她牺牲自己来供他取乐，甚至就在这个时刻，依然为他而叹 息，憔悴。他想：毛丽是那样殷切地在盼着我康复，热烈地期待着我的到 来，难道我不但让她空欢喜一场，还立刻把她投入痛苦和失望的深渊里去 吗？难道我能这样伤天害理吗？一一就在可怜的毛丽的守护神在琼斯的心 里似乎占了上风的当儿，苏菲亚对他的爱情（这已经是确凿无疑的了）径 直闯了进来，把所有的障碍一扫而光。
最后，他想到或许可以在别的方面给毛丽一些补偿，就是说，送给她 一笔钱。可是一想起毛丽曾经一再慷慨激昂地要他相信，纵使拿整个世界 来换他，也不足以弥补她的损失，汤姆认为她多半也不肯收下。然而她的 赤贫一一尤其是她的过分爱好虚荣（这一层我们已经向读者略有透露）， 又给了汤姆一些希望：尽管她口口声声表示恩情，也许仍能逐渐使她同意 接受一笔意料不到的巨款，这样，她就可以把自己抬得比和她地位相同的 人高出一头，大可满足她的虚荣心了。因此，他决计一有机会就把这意见 向她提出。
有一天，汤姆的胳膊眼看就要好了，吊着绷带蛮可以自由走动。他就 乘乡绅出门打猎的当儿，偷偷溜去看望他的情人。汤姆看到毛丽的母亲和 姐妹们正在用茶。她们先说毛丽不在家，后来那个大姐又恶意地笑了笑， 告诉他毛丽在楼上睡觉哪。自己的情妇这样来接见他，他倒也并不反对，
于是立刻爬上了正对着毛丽卧室的梯子；但汤姆这时却大吃一惊，原来房 门闩得死死的，喊了半天里头才答应，事后毛丽说她睡得太熟了。
有人曾经指出，极度的忧伤和极度的欢乐往往会产生同样效果：当我 们遭到二者之中任何一种情感突然来袭的时候，我们很容易陷于惶惑不 安，全部官能往往会失却作用。因此，琼斯先生的突然出现在毛丽心上掀 起轩然大波就不足为奇了。她心慌意乱，好一阵子还表示不出读者预料她 此刻一定会感到的那种狂喜。至于琼斯，一看到情人，心神完全不由自 主，有如中了魔法，顿时把苏菲亚完全忘掉，因而也就忘记来会晤毛丽的 主要目的了。
可是他很快就想起来了。久别重逢的一阵欢喜过去之后，他渐渐把话 头引到他们之间的爱情上去，说奥尔华绥先生曾经严厉禁止他再见毛丽， 倘若发现他们仍然保持着关系，必然会产生可怕的后果。他说，估计他的 仇人一定会把这件事透露给奥尔华绥先生，那时，他俩势必同归于尽。既 然残酷的命运非要他俩分开不可，他劝毛丽果敢地忍受一切。汤姆还发誓 说，他一辈子只要有机会能表明自己对她的真情实意，就决不放过，一定 要力所能及地照顾她的生活，让她过得比她预期的，甚至比她所梦想的还 要好。他最后说，也许不久毛丽就会找到一个男人娶她，那人准会使毛丽 比跟汤姆过这种见不得人的日子要幸福得多。
毛丽足足沉默了几分钟，然后声泪俱下地责备汤姆说："这就是你对我 的一腔恩爱啊！你糟蹋了我，如今又这样把我丢了。我对你说，男人个个 都是假情假意的，专会用嘴骗人；等你们在我们身上达到了那罪恶的目 的，就该腻了；你向我起过多少遍誓，说永远也不丢掉我！难道你竟这么 薄情寡义吗？没有了你，就是把世上的金银全给了我，又有什么用！你拿 去了我的心，是的，你拿去了……拿去了！你为什么要跟我提旁的男人？ 我这辈子再也不会爱另一个男人了。旁的男人在我眼里算得了什么！就是 全国最阔气的财主明天向我求婚，我也不会让他碰我一碰的。不，为了 你，我要永远憎恨世上所有的男人……”
就在她这么说着的当儿，突然发生了一件意外，把她的话拦腰打断。 毛丽睡的这间屋子（说得更恰当些，这间顶楼）是在二层楼上，也就是 说，紧靠屋顶。上面是尖顶，和希腊文第四个大写字母回相仿佛。除非站在 屋子中央，旁处都直不起腰来一一这么一说，英国读者也许在概念上就更 清楚些了吧。这间屋子里缺少个壁橱，为了弥补这个缺陷，毛丽就在房梁
上钉起一块旧毯子。这样，就隔出一个小角落来挂她最考究的衣物，就如 前边提过的那件撕得七零八碎的长衫、几顶帽子以及她新近弄到手的一些 东西，免得落上尘土。
这个围出的角落正对着床脚，毯子紧贴床挂着，又可以当帐幔使用。 不晓得是因为毛丽一发脾气，踹了这毯子，还是琼斯碰了它一下，要不就 是上边的按钉或钉子松了，我不敢确言；总之，正当毛丽说着最后那几句 话的时候，这块该死的毯子突然脱落，把遮在后边的一切都暴露了出来： 在那堆女人的各种用物中间，出现了（写到这里我自己觉得老大的不好意 思，读者谅必也很难过）哲学家斯奎尔先生。他的姿势（那个角落不容他 站直）真可以把人笑死。
那姿势确实和一个四马攒蹄绑起的大兵相差无几，或者说，那样子更 像伦敦通衢大道上我们时常看到的一些不是倒了霉而是罪有应得被示众的 家伙。以斯奎尔先生头戴毛丽的睡帽，毯子一落，他那两只大眼睛直直地瞪 着琼斯。倘若把哲学和他这种姿势联系起来，任何人一见都禁不住要捧腹 大笑。
不用说，读者此刻的惊讶也一定不亚于琼斯。这位明达而庄重的先生 竟然在这么个角落出现，这件事所引起的疑窦似乎和他一向在大家心目中 所保持的品格十分不相称。
不过，这种不相称也只是想象出来的，实际并非如此。哲学家同常人 一样，也是血肉做成。不管他们的理论有多么高深奥妙，然而在实际生活 中，他们毕竟也和凡人一样，有一些瑕疵也是在所难免的。正像我们以前 所指出过的，区别确实只是在理论上，而不是在实践上；因为尽管这类人 物脑子里想的要美好、睿智得多，然而行动起来他们却同常人一模一样。 他们十分懂得如何去克制贪心和色欲，蔑视悲喜之情，这种学问既不难于 获得，其中又颇有沉思默想的乐趣；然而一实行起来可就讨厌而又麻烦 了。因此，教他们懂得这门学问的那份聪明，同时也教他们去避免把它付 诸实践。
读者谅必还记得，毛丽由于穿漂亮长衫而引起风波的那个礼拜天，斯 奎尔先生正好也在教堂里。那是他头一回见到毛丽，并深深为她的美貌所 动，所以午后骑马散心的时候，他一再怂恿两位少爷另换一条路，好经过 毛丽的家，找机会再瞅上她一眼。可是这个道理当时他并没向谁提过，我 们觉得也还不宜于告诉读者。
在斯奎尔先生看来，破坏事物的适当性的因素有许多，危险与困难也 都可算在内。他所担心的困难是不容易勾引上这个小妖妇，而那危险则 是：这件事一旦被发觉，未免有损他的品格。这两者都起了有力的劝阻作 用。最初，他大概也只想观赏一下美色，聊以自慰而已。世上最庄重的人 将严肃的思考当作正餐，通常把这种观赏当作饭后的点心。于是，某些书 籍和图画就钻进了他们书斋最隐秘的角落，而自然哲学中某些猥亵部分则 往往成为他们交谈的主要话题了。
但是一两天后，哲学家听说那座贞操的堡垒早已为人攻破了，他的欲 望又大了起来。在口味上他并不过于讲究，不至于因旁人尝过，即使是美 味也不肯再吃了。一句话，他倒更高兴毛丽已不是个黄花姑娘了，因为那 可能反倒是一重障碍；现在他却一追就上手了。
如果读者以为毛丽喜欢斯奎尔甚于她那个年轻的情人，那可错了。恰 恰相反，要是只准她选一个的话，两人之间占上风的当然还是汤姆•琼斯。 斯奎尔先生所以能够达到目的，并不仅仅由于两个总比一个强（尽管毛丽 也有过这种考虑），琼斯卧病期间不能来相会也是个不幸的因素。这当 儿，哲学家送的一些精选的礼品又打动并且打开了姑娘的心，好机会既然 来到也就难以抗拒了。于是，斯奎尔把毛丽心中残剩的那点贞操赢到了 手。
琼斯是距斯奎尔奏捷半个来月之后来会他的情人的。这时，哲学家正 和毛丽同衾共枕。适才毛丽的母亲推说她不在家，真正的理由就在这里 ――既然那个老妇人从女儿这种罪恶勾当的进项里有光可沾，她就竭力去 怂恿女儿，还给她保镖。可是毛丽的姐姐非常忌恨她，尽管她也多少分享 一些战利品，却宁可放弃那点油水而毁掉她的妹妹，破坏她的生意。因 此，她才告诉琼斯说，毛丽在楼上睡觉哪，一心盼望琼斯去捉奸。不过， 由于她已把门闩上，这样就还能有机会把情人藏到毯子后边去，只是不幸 最后依然露出马脚了。
斯奎尔刚一出现，毛丽就往床上一倒，大声嚷着："我完啦！"立即陷 入了绝望的境地。可怜这个姑娘干这种勾当毕竟还是个生手，没有都市妇 人在摆脱尴尬处境时的那种沉着老练。遇到这类情况，都市妇人不是随机 应变找到个什么借口，就是索性厚着脸皮跟丈夫摊牌；那个做丈夫的，或 出于贪图安静，或由于害怕有损体面一一有时候也许还害怕那个汉子会像 戏里的康斯坦特先生四那样身佩刀剑，也乐得闭上眼睛，把绿帽子塞到口袋
里去。毛丽则恰恰相反。把柄给人抓住以后，她哑口无言。先前她挥洒着 热泪严肃激烈地表白自己有多么纯洁坚贞，这下子几乎完全撇开不顾了。
至于毯子后面的那位先生，他的狼狈自也不亚于毛丽。斯奎尔呆呆地 立了好一会儿，似乎同样不晓得该说些什么，或是朝哪里望好。尽管琼斯 也许是三个人中间最吃惊的一个，却是他头一个开口。刚才毛丽的责难使 得他十分不安，这时倒立刻平静下来。他突然哈哈大笑起来，走上前去跟 斯奎尔先生打招呼，伸手把他从那个逼仄的角落里放出来。
斯奎尔这时走到屋子中央一一只有在这儿他才直得起腰来。他带着十 分庄重的神色望着琼斯说："好啦，我看出这个重大发现使你很开心。我敢 说，想到这一下可以把我宣扬出去，你一定感到非常快活。倘若你公平合 理地想一想，就会发现这件事本应怪你自己。我没有犯败坏良家妇女清白 的罪过。我并没做出任何足以令那些根据正义的法则来判断事物的人们加 以谴责的事。适当不适当，那要决定于事物的本质，而不决定于习俗、形 式或本地的法律。凡事只要不违反自然，就不会不适当。”琼斯回答 说："老伙计，说得有道理。可是您干吗以为我要把您宣扬出去呢？老实 说，我一辈子从没今天这么对您满意过。除非您自己想向别人宣布，不然 的话，这件事我绝对保密。"斯奎尔说："琼斯先生，你可不要以为我小视 名誉。好名誉也是一种美德，忽视它是决不相宜的。况且戕害自己的名誉 就犹如自杀，而自杀是罪大恶极的。因此，倘若你认为应该为我隐瞒这个 弱点（既然任何人都不是+全十美的，我也可以有弱点），那么我答应你 我决不暴露我自己。有些事情是只宜于做，而不宜于大声宣扬的。实在说 起来，这种事情本来不但是无罪，而且还是值得嘉许的；但根据世人荒谬 的判断，却常常成了谴责的目标。"琼斯嚷道："说得对！还有什么比纵欲 更无罪的？或者，还有什么比繁殖人种更值得嘉许的事？”斯奎尔说："正 正经经地跟你说吧，我的看法也正是这样。"琼斯说："不过，当我跟这个 姑娘的关系初被发现的时候，您可不是这么看的。"斯奎尔说："我应当承 认是因为那个屠瓦孔牧师把事情说走了样，我才那么责备你破坏人的贞 操。那是因为，先生，那是因为……因为你应当知道，琼斯先生，考虑到 事物的适当性，极微小的情节，先生，极微小的情节也会造成重大的差 别。"琼斯大声说："就让它去造成差别吧。反正我刚才已答应过您，今后 如果有人晓得了这件事，那只能怪您自己。好好待这个姑娘吧，我决不向 任何人提一个字。而你毛丽，对你这个朋友要忠实。我不但原谅你对我的
不忠实，还要尽力为你效劳。"说完这话，他就匆匆告辞，溜下梯子，赶快 走了。
斯奎尔看到这件事不至于有更坏的结局，十分庆幸。至于毛丽，她一 镇定下来就责怪斯奎尔害她丢掉了琼斯，可是那位先生马上想出替她消怒 的办法：一半靠搂搂抱抱，一半靠从口袋里掏出一点灵丹妙药来一一这味 药真叫神奇，立刻使她肝火尽消，满脸含笑了。
后来，毛丽对她的新欢倾吐出无限柔情，把她刚才对琼斯说的那些话 以及琼斯本人，都大大嘲弄了一番。她赌咒说，尽管琼斯曾经占有过她的 身子，除了斯奎尔外，谁也没有赢得她的心。

第六章
把本章和前一章对照一下，读者或许会矫正他以前滥用“爱情”这 个字眼的毛病
按说琼斯发现毛丽对他不忠实之后，本可以表示出更强烈的气愤的。 倘若他立刻把她丢开不管，我相信很少有人会责难他的。
然而毫无疑问，汤姆是以同情的眼光来看待她的。尽管他对毛丽的爱 还没到看见她这样朝三暮四，就不可终日的程度，可是一想到当初是他先 破坏了她的清白，仍不免十分震惊。看来这姑娘很可能正在堕落下去，而 他把这一切都归罪于自己。
这个念头给了他不少烦恼，后来还是毛丽的姐姐贝蒂大发慈悲，透露 出一段情节，才消除了他这份烦恼。原来头一个叫毛丽失身的不是他自 己，而是一个叫威尔•巴恩斯的；汤姆一直认定是他自己的那个娃娃，至少 同样有权利管那个人叫老子。
一发现这条线索，琼斯赶忙追究下去。过不久就充分证实贝蒂的话不 假。不但威尔•巴恩斯承认了，后来甚至毛丽自己也直言不讳。
这个威尔•巴恩斯是乡村里一个勾引妇女的能手，他在这方面所俘获的 战利品决不少于全国任何一位旗手或律师的书记。他曾经害得几个女人完 全堕落下去，使另一些女人为之心碎，并且还荣幸地造成一个可怜的姑娘 的横死：她不是跳河自尽，就是（而且更可能）让他给淹死了。
贝蒂•西格里姆也是落在这个家伙手里的许多女人当中的一个。远在毛 丽发育得足以供他消遣之前，他早就把贝蒂勾引到手了。可是后来他丢掉 贝蒂，又追起她的妹妹来，而且几乎是马到成功。实际上，毛丽真心爱的 只有威尔一个，琼斯和斯奎尔都不过是她的利益和虚荣心的牺牲品而已。
因此，贝蒂和她妹妹之间才结下了我们方才所看到的不解的冤仇。然 而我们认为没有必要早一些道出这段根由，因为光是妒忌就足以引起上述 的事态了。
琼斯获知毛丽的这段隐秘之后，心里才坦然下来。但是对苏菲亚，他 的心却远远不得宁静。恰恰相反，他正处于惶惶不安的状态中。用比喻来 说，他的心此刻已别无所属，完全为苏菲亚所占据了。他一往情深地爱着 她，同时也清清楚楚地觉出苏菲亚对他的柔情蜜意。尽管有了这份把握，
可是对于取得魏斯顿的同意，他依然感到绝望；同时，一想到为了追求苏 菲亚竟必须采取任何卑鄙险诈手段，他就毛骨悚然。
白天使他焦虑不安，晚上使他辗转不眠的，是他必然加给魏斯顿先生 的损害以及他必然为奥尔华绥先生带来的痛苦。他不断在道义和个人愿望 的矛盾中讨生活，这两者轮流在他心里占上风。当苏菲亚不在眼前的时 候，他往往决计离开魏斯顿家，永不再见她一面；可是一看到苏菲亚，他 又往往把这份决心抛到九霄云外，就是冒丧失性命的危险，甚至不惜牺牲 比性命还要宝贵的东西，也一定要追求她。
这种内心的矛盾很快就在汤姆身上起了强烈而明显的影响，他失去了 平时的欢快活泼，不但独处的时候闷闷不乐，就是和旁人在一道时也无精 打采，心不在焉；当他强作笑颜来应付魏斯顿先生说的一些打趣话时，神 情间显然出于勉强，结果，反而把他想隐藏的心绪更加表露出来了。
很难断言，使他的心事外泄更多的究竟是他在隐瞒内心热情方面的技 术不够呢，还是诚实的本性不容他不把它揭示出来。这种技术要求他对苏 菲亚比以前更加拘谨，不再用言语向她表示什么，甚至避开她的视线；但 同时本性又在忙于破坏他这意图。所以每当小姐走近他，汤姆的脸色就刷 地变得惨白；倘若她是突然走近的，汤姆就会吓一大跳。偶然间，要是汤 姆碰上她的视线，血液立刻就会涌上他的双颊，满脸通红。遇到由于礼貌 不得不向她开口时（比如席间祝酒），他总会张口结舌的。倘若他触到苏 菲亚，他的手一一不，他通身都会颤抖起来。要是谈话稍稍涉及爱情，就 会引起他不由自主的一声叹息。造物真是再殷勤不过，每天都让他碰上几 件这类的事。
尽管乡绅无所觉察，这一切却逃不过苏菲亚的眼睛。她很快就看出琼 斯的怔忡不安，也不难发现其原因，因为在她自己心里也发觉了同样的感 情。我料想，这种发觉正是由于人们常在情人之间所看到的那种共鸣，这 也大可以说明为什么苏菲亚的感觉要比她父亲来得敏锐。
不过老实说，还有个更加简单明了的办法可以说明何以某些人对旁人 具有极为深刻的洞察力，这洞察力还不仅适用于情人之间，在一般人之间 也如此。譬如，何以往往使才智卓越的诚实人吃亏上当的阴谋诡计，坏人 却总是一眼就能识破？坏人之间当然无所谓同情，也不会像共济会那样， 彼此有什么暗号来互通声息。实际上，那只是因为他们脑子里装的东西毫 无二致，他们的思路朝着同一个方向。所以，琼斯身上那种明显的迹象，
苏菲亚一眼就看得出，而魏斯顿却看不见，这丝毫不足为奇：因为老子的 脑子里从没想过爱情，而那女儿此刻除了爱情就没想旁的。
当苏菲亚证实了可怜的琼斯是为深挚的爱情所苦，并且也清楚他所爱 的就是她自己时，她很容易就弄清了造成他目前这般景况的真正原因。这 个发现使她更加觉得汤姆可爱可亲，于是她心里就出现了所有男人最希望 在爱人心中引起的两种情感一一敬重和怜惜；连最冷峻的女人也不能责怪 她去怜惜一个为她而痛苦的男人，不能责怪她去敬重一个显然由于最高贵 的动机而极力熄灭自己胸头火焰的男人一一那火焰，就像人所共知的斯巴 达的贼赃M那样燃烧着、摧毁着他的生命。因此，他的畏畏缩缩，躲躲闪 闪，他对苏菲亚的冷淡，缄默，倒变成他的最大胆、殷勤、热烈和最娓娓 动听的追求了。这些深深地感动了她那温柔、敏锐的心灵。不久，苏菲亚 就对他产生了一个高贵、贤淑的女性胸膛里所能怀有的一切好感一一一句 话，就是一个可意的男人所能引起的尊敬、眷念和怜惜，一切不失闺范的 情操。简单一句话，苏菲亚爱他爱得神魂颠倒了。
有一天，这对年轻人在花园里沿水渠的两条小径尽头，偶然碰到了。 以前琼斯为了替苏菲亚捉回小鸟而跌进去的，就是这道水渠。
近来苏菲亚时常到这地方来。在这里，她既痛苦又快乐地回味着那件 事。尽管事情不大，然而他们之间的情苗却可能就是那回种下的。这时， 那情苗在她心里已经茁壮生长起来了。
这对青年就在这儿会了面。他们是快走到一起时才发觉对方的。旁边 要是有人，一定会在他们脸上看出非常局促不安的神情，可是这两人却心 事重重，什么也不及观察。琼斯最初的那阵震惊稍微过去后，就照正常的 礼节向小姐问安，苏菲亚也照样应答。和往日一样，他们先说起清晨多么 和煦宜人，然后谈到四周景色的秀丽，琼斯大大赞扬了一番。当他们走到 琼斯落水的那棵树跟前的时候，苏菲亚不禁提起那次的意外。她说："琼斯 先生，我想每逢看到这道水，您不免还有些心惊胆战吧。”琼斯回答 说："小姐，请您相信，我永远认为那回顶要紧的还是您因失掉小鸟而感到 的不安。可怜的小汤米！它就站在这枝树杈上。多蠢的东西！我替它安排 了这么幸福的境地，它竟然要飞走！它的下场就是对它的忘恩负义一个公 正的惩罚。"苏菲亚说："可是琼斯先生，您那番好心几乎也遭到同样残酷 的命运。回想起来您一定还很不舒服吧？”他回答说："小姐，说到这里， 倘若我有什么遗憾之处，那也许是水还不够深，不然的话，我就可以避免
命运替我准备下的许多愁苦了。"苏菲亚说："哎呀，琼斯先生，您这一定 是跟我说着玩的。您故意这么轻视自己的性命，只是出于对我过分客气。
您是要我对您两次为我冒的生命危险不必介意。可是当心还会有第三回 哩！"最后这段话，她是带着微笑和无法形容的温存说出的。琼斯听了叹息 一声，回答说：现在提醒他恐怕已经太晚了。然后，他温柔地凝视着苏菲 亚说："啊，魏斯顿小姐，难道您会愿意我活下去吗？您能愿意我这么不幸 吗？”苏菲亚俯首望着地，带着几分踌躇说："琼斯先生，我决不愿意您遭 到不幸。"琼斯大声说："啊，我深深知道您那天使般善良的性格，圣者一 般仁慈的心肠一一那要远远超过其他任何魅力。"她说："我明白您说的是 什么。我得回去啦。"琼斯说："我……我不愿意让您明白！我也没法让您 明白。我不知道自己在说些什么。没想到会在这儿遇到您，我没加思索就 把心里的话向您倾吐出来了。要是我说了什么开罪您的话，看在老天的面 上，请原谅我吧。我完全是无心的。真的，我宁可死掉一一一想到得罪了 您，我就没法活下去。"苏菲亚说："您真令我不解。您怎么会想到得罪了 我？”他说："小姐，恐惧是很容易使人发疯的。再也没有比想到得罪您更 使我害怕的了。我怎么说好呢？别那么生气地望着我吧。您只要皱皱眉就 会要我的命的。我没有得罪您的意思。都怪我的眼睛一一要不，就怪您长 得太美。我在说些什么呢？要是我太啰嗦了，请您原谅我。我实在控制不 住自己的感情。我曾经尽量克制对您的爱，想把燃烧着我的心肝五脏的那 股烈火遮掩起来。我希望不久我就再也不可能来得罪您了。”
这时，琼斯通身颤抖起来，仿佛在发疟子。苏菲亚的情况和他也差不 多。她这样回答他说："琼斯先生，我不愿假装着不了解您。其实，我很了 解您。可是您要是对我有些感情的话，那么就看在老天的面上，尽快让我 回去吧。要是我能自己挣扎着回去就好了。”
琼斯自己也不大站得稳，他还是把胳膊伸过来让苏菲亚挽着。苏菲亚 欣然挽了他的臂，可是央求琼斯，关于这类事眼下一个字也别提。他答应 一定不提，只是一再求苏菲亚饶恕他刚才说的那些话一一那是他情不自禁 讲出来的。苏菲亚说，饶不饶，这要看他日后的所作所为了。于是，一对 年轻人就蹒跚地、战栗地走着。尽管这位情郎握着意中人的手，他却不敢 捏紧一下。
苏菲亚径直回到自己的房间。昂诺尔大姐一听到呼唤，就拿鹿茸精来 伺候了。至于可怜的琼斯，唯一安慰他那颗烦乱的心的，是一条不受欢迎
的消息。这消息把我们引入另一种情景，性质上与前几章读者所熟悉的迥 乎不同，所以我们留待下一章来叙述。
第七章
奥尔华绥先生卧床不起
魏斯顿先生越来越喜欢琼斯，所以尽管他的臂伤已经康复，乡绅还是 舍不得让他走；而不论是由于爱好打猎或是旁的什么原因，琼斯都是不难 挽留的。他在魏斯顿先生家里一直住了下来，有时候半个月也不去看奥尔 华绥先生一趟一一甚至连一点音讯也没从那里得到。
奥尔华绥先生近几天着了凉，很不舒服，并且还有些发烧。然而他并 没在意一一只要他不至于病到卧床不起，饮食起居照常，他总是满不在意 的。读者切莫以为我们赞同或有意奉劝大家去仿效这种做法。精通医道的 先生嘱咐得不差：疾病一来临，马上就该请大夫。不然，Venienti occurrite morbo （病魔一临，立加对抗）这句古谚还能有什么旁的意思 呢？这样，大夫和病魔较量起来便可势均力敌。倘若让病魔赢得时间，容 它能高垒固守，像法兰西的军队那样，就会使得大夫难以一一有时甚至不 可能进击敌人。不仅如此，有了时间病魔还可以采用法兰西战术，使自己 在自然条件方面获得优势，到最后任何药石都会因来得太晚，全然无效 了。我记得米扫宾四大医师有一段埋怨的话与这种看法不谋而合。他曾经为 那些求他医治而来得太晚的病人深深惋惜说："我相信这些病人把我当作办 理丧事的了，不到庸医把他们治死了，决不来请我。”
奥尔华绥先生的病就由于这种疏忽而沉重起来。当他的热度升到不得 不延医治疗时，大夫一到就摇摇头，说可惜没早些把他请来，并且暗示据 他看来，病势十分危险。奥尔华绥先生在这个世界的一切事务都已料理停 当，凡人为另外那个世界应做的准备，他也都准备好了。因此，听到这话 他也镇定自若，无所牵挂。真的，每当他躺下休息的时候，他都可以和伽 图丝一起吟诵那悲剧中的诗句：
恐惧与罪孽常扰人心魂; 伽图对此二者却从不相识； 小睡与长眠又何足重轻。
事实上，他比伽图或任何古今豪杰都更有十倍理由和自信来讲这些话。因 为他不但心中毫无畏惧，并且也可以被看作一名勤恳的雇工，在收割之
后，便到宽厚的主人四那里去领取报酬。
于是这位善人立刻吩咐把家里人都召集到跟前。除了前些时已去伦敦 的布利非太太以及读者刚才在魏斯顿先生家里见到的琼斯先生，家里人一 个不缺一一琼斯刚和苏菲亚分手，就接到家里的召唤。
-听到奥尔华绥先生病势垂危（仆人告诉他奥尔华绥先生快要断气 了）,琼斯马上就把爱情抛在脑后，急忙跳进派来的马车，吩咐车夫尽快 赶回去，一路上我相信他一次也没想到过苏菲亚。
这时，全家一一那就是说，布利非先生、琼斯先生、屠瓦孔先生、斯 奎尔先生以及一些仆人（他们是按照奥尔华绥先生的吩咐找来的）都围着 病榻。病人坐起来刚要开口，突然间，布利非呜呜痛哭，大声哀号开了。 奥尔华绥先生握着他的手说："亲爱的外甥，不要这么难过吧，生死是人间 常事。要是听到朋友遭到不幸，我们难过是理所当然的，因为那种意外灾 祸通常是可以避免的；因此，碰上的人就格外显得不幸。然而人终归必有 一死，无论贫富都不能免，时间的迟早无关紧要。倘若世上哲人把一生比 作一瞬间，我们总可以把它看作一天。我命中注定要在傍晚离去，那些比 我早死的人损失的也不过几个钟头而已一一那并不值得惋惜，况且那往往 是充满了辛劳、疲惫、痛苦、悲伤的时刻。我记得一位罗马诗人把我们的 辞世比作宴会上的离席。每当我看见人们迟迟不肯结束一场欢宴，拼命想 和朋友们多聚一刻时，这个比喻就在我脑中出现。唉，随你怎么延长，这 种宴会也是多么短促啊！最早退席的和留到最末的宾客之间，差别又是多 么微不足道！这还是从最好的角度来看待生命的，这种对朋友依依不舍之 情也是惧怕死亡的动机中最为可贵的。然而不论怎样延长，欢聚毕竟是短 暂的，在明达人眼中是无足轻重的。自然，抱这种看法的人并不多，因为 大部分人不到鬼门关是不会想到死的。尽管人们临近死亡时感到它是个巨 大而可怕的东西，可是当死亡离得还较远时，偏偏就看不见它。不仅如 此，尽管人们到命在旦夕的时刻会吓得心惊胆寒，可是死亡关头一过，恐 惧之心也就随之烟消云散了。不过，唉，躲开了死亡并不就意味着获得赦 免，那只能说是缓刑一一缓上短短的一天而已。
"因此，亲爱的孩子，不要为这件事伤心了吧。这是随时都可能发生 的。宇宙间的一切物质一一不，我们周围的一草一木都会死亡的，这也是 我们每人无法避免的必然结局。它既不该引起我们的惊讶，也不该叫我们 悲伤。
"大夫告诉我说（我认为他是十分善意的），也许不久我就要和你们永 别了。我觉得病势越来越严重，我决定在失去说话能力之前，先对你们讲 几句告别的话。
"不过这会大大消耗我的气力。我打算和你们谈谈我的遗嘱。虽然我早 就立好了，可是我想还是应该提一提和你们每个人有关的项目。这样，看 到你们对我所安排下的一切都满意，我也可以感到快慰。
"布利非外甥，我的全部产业都由你继承，只除开一笔每年五百镑的进 益一一那要待你母亲去世后才归你所有；此外还有一笔每年五百镑进益的 产业，以及六千镑现款，要照下面的办法分配：
"琼斯先生，我把那笔年入五百镑进益的产业留给你。我很知道手边缺 钱是不便的，所以另外为你加上一千镑现金。我不晓得这是超出了还是不 及你所预期的。也许你觉得我给得太少了，而别的人又可能嫌我给得太 多。但是后者的指责我倒从不在意的；至于前者嘛，希望你不会抱有某些 人作为一毛不拔的借口的那种谬见，说什么：慷慨的施与不但不能引起感 激之情，反而往往会招来漫无止境、难以餍足的欲望……请原谅我这么 说，我并不猜疑你会有这种想法。”
琼斯跪倒在他恩人跟前，热烈地握住他的手说：不论现在还是过去， 乡绅对他的慈爱都不但远远超过他所应得的，也远远超过他所希望得到 的，他的感激无法用话语来形容。他说："先生，请您相信，听到您这慷慨 的赠予，我心里唯一关切的是这生离死别的时刻。啊，我的朋友，我的父 亲!"说到这里，他已泣不成声，连忙扭过脸去，免得让奥尔华绥先生看到 他眼眶里涌出的泪水。
这时，奥尔华绥轻轻地攥了攥他的手说："孩子，我深深知道你的天性 十分善良，你是慷慨和光明磊落的；如果这以外再加上稳健持重和笃信宗 教，你就一定会幸福的。尽管前三种美德能够使你享受幸福，唯有后两者 才能叫你的幸福持久下去。
"屠瓦孔先生，我赠给您一千镑。我相信这笔钱会大大超过您的希望和 您的需要。不过，请您收下来，作为我们友谊的纪念吧。倘若这笔钱对您 是身外之物，那么您对宗教一向保持的热忱也会告诉您该怎样去支配它。
"斯奎尔先生，我同样赠给您一千镑，希望这笔钱可以有助于您所从事 的职业，使您今后可以比过去顺利些。我往往看到贫困更容易引起的不是 同情，而是轻蔑一一尤其在事业家中间，他们认为一个人要是受穷，那就
表示他庸碌无能。我对这情况很为痛心。但是我这笔赠予可以帮助您从以 前所遭到的种种困难中解脱出来。我相信，像您这样一位深明哲理的人， 今后一定会有足够的财力来满足您的一切需求的。
"我感觉自己气力微弱了。此外的赠予，就请你们去看我的遗嘱吧。家 里的仆人也会得到我的一些纪念物的。还有几项慈善事业的捐款，我相信 遗嘱执行人一定会遵照办理的。祝福你们。我要比你们先走一步了。”
说到这里，一个听差匆匆进来，说外边有位从索尔兹伯里来的律师， 他带来一个特别重要的口信，说必须当面告诉奥尔华绥先生本人；看来这 人十分匆忙，他说还有许多要务在身，事情多得即使有分身法也办不完。
"孩子，你去，"奥尔华绥对布利非说，"看看这位先生有什么事。我现 在没力气去同人打交道了，而且他要跟我办的事，此刻必然和你更加有 关。而且我此刻实在不能会什么人，精神也支持不住了。"说完这话，他向 大家致意，说也许还能够和他们再见一面，不过眼下他很想养养神，觉着 刚才这席话说得他精疲力竭了。
大家临走的时候，有的落了泪；甚至"向来不惯于啼哭的"姓哲学家斯 奎尔也拭了拭眼睛。至于威尔根斯大娘，她"那一串串泪珠跟阿拉伯橡胶树 上滴下的药用汁液一样滔滔不绝"姓一一每遇到适当场合，这种礼数她是从 不会短少的。
这以后，奥尔华绥先生重新躺下来，枕上枕头，静静养神。
第八章
本章叙述的事虽不甚可喜，却为人之常情
除去为了主人而悲伤外，这位管家婆那峻峭的颧骨上滚滚流着的咸水 河另外还有个源头。她一回到自己的房间立刻就不停地痛痛快快嘟嚷起 来："按说在仆人中间老爷总该对我另眼看待的吧。也许他留给我一件丧 服。可要只是这个，哼，那就让魔鬼替他穿去吧！他应该知道我并不是个 叫化子。自从我来伺候他，我替他节省了五百镑，到头来却这么对待我！ 诚实的仆人竟然落到这么个下场，以后谁还诚实呀！其实，我虽然时不时 地拿上他一星半点儿的，别人拿的却比我多十倍，如今我们却都被一律看 待了。要是非这样不可的话，就让那遗嘱和立遗嘱的人一道去见魔鬼吧。 不，给我什么我也不能拒绝，那样就会叫某些人开心。我要买上一件颜色 最鲜艳的衣裳，穿起来在这个老吝啬鬼的坟头上跳舞。当这一带左邻右舍 都因为他收养那个野种骂他无耻的时候，我总是替他辩护。这就是他给我 的报答！可是他现在就要到那个算总账的地方去啦。临死的时刻，他本应 该好好忏悔一下自己的罪孽，可是他却炫耀那罪孽。居然从自家的产业里 拨出一份给个私生子！在他自己的床上发现的一一哼，说得真好听！嘿， 嘿，藏东西的人总会知道上哪儿去找的。上帝饶恕他吧。要是真相露出来 的话，我敢说他名下还有的是野种哪。可喜的是，到了阴间，他一个也瞒 不住。’家里的仆人也会得到我的一些纪念物的。’这就是他的原话。活上一 千年我也忘不了。哼，我会永远记得你竟把我塞到仆人堆里去。谁都会 想，他总该像对斯奎尔那样提提我的名字吧一一斯奎尔倒真是位绅士，虽 然初来的时候身上连件衣裳也没有。什么臭绅士！他在这儿住了这么些 年，我就不信哪个仆人见过他的钱边儿。照我说，叫魔鬼去替我伺候这样 的绅士吧。"这一类的话她还嘟嚷了许多，不过，读者领略了这点也尽够 了。
屠瓦孔和斯奎尔对他们各自所得的那份也不见得比威尔根斯大娘更满 意些。尽管他们没有像这位管家婆那样大声埋怨，可是从他们那悻悻的脸 色以及下面这段谈话，我们也可以看出他们心里不是怎么高兴的。
两人离开病室后一小时左右，斯奎尔在大厅里遇到了屠瓦孔，就对他 说："哦，先生，咱们分手后，您可曾听到您那位朋友的什么消息？”屠瓦 孔回答说："您指的如果是奥尔华绥先生的话，我觉得称他作您的朋友倒更
恰当些，我认为这样的称呼他可以当之无愧。"斯奎尔说："这称呼对您也 是同样相宜呀，因为他给咱们俩的布施（就是点布施呀）是一般多啊。"屠 瓦孔嚷道："我本不愿先提这个问题，可是既然您开了头，那么我就不得不 告诉您，我的看法两样。主动的馈赠与应得的报酬之间是大有区别的。以 我为这家所效的劳，在那两个孩子的教育上所花的心血，得的好处总应该 比旁人要多一些才是。但是您可别以为我这是表示不满。因为圣保罗曾教 导我,要满足于自己所有的’。近那数目就是再少些，我也不会忘记我的职 责。不过《圣经》虽然教我安分知足，它可并没让我漠视自己的功绩呀， 也没阻止我在相比起来受到不公平待遇时感到委屈。"斯奎尔反驳说："您 既然向我挑衅，我也只得说：我才是受委屈的呢。我从来没想到奥尔华绥 先生会这么小看我对他的友谊，竟然把我同一个向他领工资的人等量齐 观。我晓得这是怎么引起来的：这是由于长时期以来您无视宇宙间一切伟 大而高贵的东西，总是把种种狭隘的观念往他脑海里灌。友谊是那么美丽 可爱，昏花的眼睛会感到太强烈。只有借着您常竭力嘲笑的那万无一失的 正义法则，才能看得出来。您把您那位贵友的头脑引入邪途了。"屠瓦孔气 得咆哮起来："为了拯救他的灵魂，但愿您别再用那套该死的学说把他的信 仰引入邪途去了。我认为他当前的行为与一个基督教徒如此之不相称，都 应归咎于您。除了无神论者，谁会在辞世以前不先把一生向上帝交代一 下，忏悔自己的罪愆，以求获得赦免呢一一他明明知道家里就有一个人掌 握神权，可以对他宣布赦免。些及至他到了人人都在哀哭、咬牙切齿的那个 地方丝，这才发觉必须做的事，可是悔之晚矣。那时他就会领教出您以及当 代其他的自然神论者所崇奉的那个邪神异教一一'道德'是多么不中用了。那 时他才想起招呼他的牧师，可是早已找不到了。他只好悲叹辞世前不曾得 到赦免一一而没有这种赦免，任何罪人都是不能得救的。"斯奎尔说："如 果赦免是如此之重要，您何不主动赐予他呢？”屠瓦孔大声说："除非是诚 心诚意地要求赦免，不然的话，那是没有灵效的。可是我何必跟一个异教 徒一一一个不信奉上帝的人这么白费唇舌呢？是您把这种学说传给他的， 为此，您在阳世已经得到了充分的报酬，我毫不怀疑您的弟子马上也会在 阴间得到应有的报酬。"斯奎尔说："我不晓得您所说的'报酬'指的是什么， 如果指的是他为了纪念我们之间的友谊而送的那点不足挂齿的东西的话， 我是瞧不上眼的。要不是我当前处境困难，我才不会接受呢。”
这时，大夫来了，向正在争辩的双方询问楼上情形怎样。屠瓦孔回答 说："十分糟糕。"大夫大声说："那我是早已料到的。不过，请问，我走了 之后有过些什么征象？”屠瓦孔回答说："没有什么好转的迹象，我看是希 望不大啦。"医治肉体的大夫也许误会了这位灵魂的医治者的意思，可是屠 瓦孔正要解释的时候，布利非先生哭丧着脸走了进来，说他得到一个悲痛 的消息：他母亲在索尔兹伯里去世了；说她在回家的途中，头部和肠胃突 然痛风症发作，不上几个钟头就死了。大夫说："哎呀，真是人有旦夕祸 福！不过我要是在她身边就好了。痛风症是不大好治的，但是我治起来却 灵得很。"屠瓦孔和斯奎尔都向布利非先生表示吊唁，在这丧母之际，一个 劝他要像个男子汉，另一个劝他要像个基督教徒那样。那位年轻绅士说， 他晓得人终不免一死，他一定咬住牙根去忍受这份不幸。不过，他不能不 稍稍抱怨命运对他过分残酷，让他这么突然地得到这个噩耗，而且是正当 他等待着狠毒的命运随时会加给他最沉重的打击的时候。他说，他从屠瓦 孔先生和斯奎尔先生学得的那些至理名言，现在正好受到了考验。倘若他 身遭不幸而能坚忍如初，那完全应归功于两位老师的教导有方。
现在引起争论的问题，是该不该把布利非太太去世的消息通知给奥尔 华绥先生。大夫坚决反对去告诉，我相信整个医学界也会同意他这种态 度。但是布利非先生说，他舅父曾经多次明确吩咐他，决不要由于怕引起 他的不安而向他隐瞒什么，因此，不管有什么后果，他也不敢违背舅父的 吩咐。他说，依他看来，他舅父笃信宗教，深明哲理，大夫的担忧是多余 的。因此，他决定非把这消息通知病人不可。因为万一他舅父康复了（而 他布利非也正为此而虔诚地祷告着上帝），他相信舅父一定会为了想把这 样的事瞒住他而永不饶恕他的。
由于两位博学的绅士一致热烈赞成这个决定，大夫也只好勉强同意。 于是，布利非先生和大夫一同朝病室走去。大夫先进去，走到床跟前为病 人按脉，随后就宣布病势已经大有起色；他说上一剂药真是功效神速，烧 已经退了。先前他担心病人已经毫无希望，现在则认为已经毫无危险了。
老实说，奥尔华绥先生的病情从来也没有像过分谨慎的大夫说的那么 严重。可是正如善于用兵的将军，不管对方力量多么薄弱，从不轻敌，一 位精于医道的大夫也从不小视疾病一一不论症候多么轻微。尽管敌势弱得 不堪一击，明智的将军总还是同样保持严格的军纪，设置同样的岗哨，派 出同样多的斥候；尽管症候轻微，一位明智的大夫也总是同样板着面孔，
带着同样意味深长的神情摇头晃脑。除了其他许多响亮的理由之外，这二 者的做法还有一个极为切实的原因：倘若他们获得胜利，那么光彩就可以 更大一些；倘若失败了，也不致显得太丢脸。
奥尔华绥先生刚抬起眼皮来感谢上苍让他有了康复的希望，布利非先 生马上凑过去，满面愁容，把手帕放到眼睛上，似乎在揩眼泪，又似乎在 按照奥维德下面这句话行事：
Si nullus erit, tamen excute nullum, [28] 如果一滴也无，那么就拭去那无有，
然后，他把读者刚才听到的消息，报告给他舅父。
奥尔华绥先生以悲痛的心情，坚忍而达观地听完外甥的话。他淌了几 滴热泪，然后，镇定了一下神气，大声说："万事由上帝做主！ ”
他问起捎信的人，布利非却说：他没法子留他多耽搁一下，看来那人 有要务在身，忙得不可开交；说那人抱怨事情多得简直让他疲于奔命，一 再说即使他有分身术，也不用想样样都办完。
奥尔华绥吩咐布利非去好生料理殡葬事宜。他说还是把他妹妹安葬在 他自己的教堂里。至于具体如何办理，就由外甥自去斟酌，他只指定了请 哪位牧师来主持葬礼。
第九章
在本章里，厄斯吉尼兹［29】的名言“对镜见真容，酒醉显真心”得 到了旁证
读者或许奇怪何以上一章里只字也没提到琼斯先生。事实上，他的行 为和我们刚才讲的那些人完全两样，所以我们有意不把他的名字与那些人 相提并论。
那位善人说完话以后，琼斯是最后一个离开病室的。他就回到自己的 房间，在那里发起愁来。他心里十分不安，不能在房里久留，就悄悄走到 奥尔华绥先生的房内口。他倾听了好半天，里边什么动静也没有，只有雷 鸣般的鼾声一一在惊慌中，他把鼾声当作呻吟声了。这下他可急坏了，忍 不住就推开房内，迈了进去。看到那位善人躺在床上睡得很好，原来大打 其鼾的是伏在床脚的护士。他立即采取唯一的办法来制止这位低音伴奏 家，生怕这音乐会惊动了奥尔华绥先生。然后他就在护士旁边坐了下来， 一点也没动弹，直到布利非和那位大夫来叫醒病人：大夫是来诊一诊脉息 的，布利非则是来报告那个消息一一如果琼斯事先晓得布利非要报告的是 什么，他是决不会轻易让他在这种时刻把那些话送到奥尔华绥先生的耳朵 里去的。
琼斯初听到布利非把那个消息告诉给他舅父的时候，他对这种不择时 机非常生气，不由心头火起，尤其看到大夫连连摇头，表示不赞成让病人 知道这事。但是他并没有气昏了头，以致意识不到对布利非任何愤怒的表 示可能给病人带来的影响。这种顾虑使他暂时抑止了自己的愤怒；后来发 现这消息在病者身上实际上也并没产生什么恶果，心下自是很高兴，那股 怒气也就被丢在脑后了，他从没有向布利非提过一个字。
大夫那天在奥尔华绥先生家里用饭，饭后他又去看望病人，回来告诉 大家说，他现在可以把握十足地保证病人已经完全脱离险境了。眼下烧已 退了，他相信再服上一服解热剂，就不至于再发烧了。
琼斯听了这话真是心花怒放，高兴得如醉如狂。同时他又喝了些酒， 心情更加兴奋了。这时候他开怀畅饮（为了祝大夫的健康他干了许多杯， 为了祝同席人的健康他又干了许多杯），过不久，他就真的醉了。
琼斯生来就是个血气旺盛的人，如今借着酒力，越发肆无忌惮地活跃 起来。他亲热地搂住大夫，吻他，并且发誓说，除去奥尔华绥先生，大夫
是世上他最爱的人了。"大夫，”琼斯大声说，"真应该用公款替您塑一座 像，因为您所救活的这位不但受到一切与他相识的人的爱戴，并且也是社 会的福星，国家的光辉，人类的荣誉。如果我爱他不胜过爱我自己的灵 魂，就让我下地狱。”
"那你就更可耻了 ！"屠瓦孔大声说，"不过，你当然有理由去爱他，因 为他给了你那么多财产。对有些人来说，也许他还不如干脆死掉的好，免 得有朝一日又觉得应该取消自己的遗赠。”
琼斯用难以想象的鄙夷望了望屠瓦孔，回答说："你这个卑劣的家伙！ 难道你以为我心里会计较这些吗？不，宁可地球张开嘴，把它的土地全吞 下去（即使我有几百万亩土地，我也要这么说），也不要吞掉我这位亲爱 的、无比光辉的朋友。”
Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus
Tam chari capitis ? [301
这时，大夫从中调解，才避免了琼斯与屠瓦孔之间的一场愤怒的争 吵。那以后，琼斯就尽情欢乐，唱了两三支恋歌，并且做出一些人在过分 兴高采烈时往往会做出的荒唐举动。然而他丝毫也没有和人吵架的意思； 如果可能的话，他的性子倒比清醒的时候更加好上十倍。
通常认为酒后爱发脾气、吵架的这种人，不醉的时候倒是好好先生， 其实，这见解是再荒谬不过了。实际上，酒并不颠倒人性，或者在人们心 里制造本来并不存在的情感。它只是撤去理性的岗哨，从而迫使我们显出 种种丑态一一而在清醒时刻，我们总有办法掩饰过去。酒不过是加强和更 激动了我们的感情（通常总是涌在心头的那股）。所以三杯老酒一下肚， 人的各种性格一一爱生气的，多情的，慷慨的，柔和的，贪婪的，就会格 外清楚地表现出来。
虽然酗酒闹事在英国（尤其在下层人们中间）比任何地方都更为习见 （真的，饮酒和打架在这里简直就是一码事儿），但我并不因此就断定英 国人是天底下脾气最暴躁的。英国人之好酗酒闹事，骨子里也许还是由于 我们对荣誉的爱好。所以公平而论，我们的同胞们似乎比别国人更爱荣 誉，也更加勇敢；尤其足以证明这一点的，是英国人在酒后吵架时很少做
出什么卑鄙、讨巧和狠毒的事。恰恰相反，甚至在争吵中，双方往往还表 示好感。我们撒酒疯通常以打一架为结束，而我们打架又时常以友谊为收 场。
还是书归正传吧。尽管琼斯丝毫不想冒犯谁，可是他这种举动和布利 非先生素日谨严持重的性格完全不合，布利非先生十分生气。他觉得此刻 这样实在不成体统，令人难以容忍。他说，他的慈母刚刚去世，家里正在 居丧。倘若上苍垂怜，奥尔华绥先生康复有望，那也最好用感恩来表示衷 心的欣悦，而不是醉酒胡闹一一那样只会更加招致天谴，而不会免除它。 屠瓦孔对布利非这一席虔诚的宏论，大为赞赏。他灌下的酒虽然比琼斯 多，可是神志一点也没乱。斯奎尔则一声也没吭，原因何在，读者大概会 猜得出来。
其实，琼斯也并没醉到神志昏迷的地步。所以经布利非先生一提，马 上就想起他母亲故去的不幸来了。再也没有比琼斯更勇于承认并责备自己 过失的人了。他赶忙伸出手来，向布利非道歉。他说，因为奥尔华绥先生 的康复，一时欢喜得过了头，所以把旁的事全抛到脑后了。
布利非满脸鄙夷地拒绝和他握手，并且悻悻地说：瞎子对悲惨景象无 动于衷，那原是毫不足怪的。至于他布利非，不幸而晓得谁是自己的生身 父母，因此，对母亲的去世就不能不感到悲痛。
尽管琼斯脾气好，性子里也带些肝火。听到这话，他立刻就从椅子上 跳了起来，抓着布利非的衣领骂道："你这个该死的无赖！你拿我不幸的出 身来侮辱我吗？"边说还边动手动脚的。向来不好吵架的布利非先生终于也 按捺不住了，于是，两个就交起手来。要不是屠瓦孔和大夫拦住，真会闹 出大乱子来的。至于斯奎尔，他深明哲理，喜怒哀乐向来不入心坎。像往 常遇到吵架时一样，他依旧泰然自若地吸着他的烟斗，只要嘴里的烟斗不 至于被人折断，他就屹然不动。
吵架的双方这时都被拉开了，不能当场报复，他们照例只好十分不甘 心地用恫吓和轻蔑来泄泄怒气。动拳脚时，命运似乎更偏向琼斯；轮到动 起舌头，他的敌人似乎又占了上风。
由于中立者的调处，双方终于同意休战，大家一齐坐回餐桌边。琼斯 在中立者的敦促下道了歉，对方也接受了他的道歉。这样，和平得以实 现，一切好像又恢复了原状。
看起来争吵已经完全和解了，可是给它打断了的兴致却再也没恢复过 来。一切欢娱的气氛都消失了，随后谈的都是些枯燥乏味的事，以及对这 些事物同样枯燥乏味的见解。这类话题尽管一本正经，满是些大道理，却 并没多大趣味。既然我们只打算为读者叙述有趣的事，那么他们之间的这 段谈话就从略了。谈到最后，一个个都慢慢走开，只剩下斯奎尔和大夫 了。这时候，由于他们又议论起两位少爷吵架的事，谈话又活跃了一些。 大夫说，两个都不折不扣是坏蛋，哲学家则意味深长地摇晃着脑袋，对这 个说法大表赞同。
第十章
表明奥维德和其他更为严肃的作家们的见解都是绝对正确的，他们 令人信服地证明：酒往往是淫乱之媒
琼斯离开我们刚才看到的那伙人之后，就信步来到田野里，打算先在 户外散散步，清醒清醒头脑，再去探视奥尔华绥先生。自从他的朋友兼恩 人病危以来，他已经有些时候没思念亲爱的苏菲亚了。正当琼斯重新怀念 她的时候，发生了一件事。我们现在怀着悲痛的心情来叙述这件事，我们 相信读者看到这里也必然十分难过。不过既然我们声明过要严格遵守历史 的真实，就不能不把这件事讲给后人听。
这是六月下旬一个愉快的黄昏。我们的主人公正在一片极其可爱的树 丛里散步，吹拂树叶的微风，悦耳的潺潺流水和夜莺的婉转娇啼，奏出令 人神往的和谐曲调。在这极宜于谈情说爱的美景中，琼斯思念起亲爱的苏 菲亚来了。他那奔放的幻觉漫无止境地玩赏着苏菲亚通身的美，在逼真的 摹想中，他描绘出姑娘绰约的丰姿。柔情融化了他那颗炽热的心。最后， 傍着一道淙淙溪流，他卧在大地上，忽然这样感叹起来：
"啊，苏菲亚，如果上天把你送进我的怀抱，我该多么幸福呀！命运真 可恶，它生生把我们分开了。只要能得到你，即使你的全部财产就是一件 破衣，世上也不会有任何男子值得我去羡慕。就是塞尔加西亚更最标致的美 人，戴上印度产的所有珠宝，我也不屑一顾。可是我又何必去提旁的女人 呢！倘若我的眼睛会东顾西盼，我情愿亲手把它们挖掉。不，亲爱的苏菲 亚，倘若命运非把我们永远拆散不可，我的灵魂也将爱你一个人。我心里 将始终不渝地保存着你的芳容。即使我永远也没有希望得到你那可爱的形 体，独自占有我的思想、爱情和灵魂的，仍然只有你。啊，我的情怀充满 了对你的爱慕，绝世美人在我眼里也显不出姿色，便是给她们搂在怀里， 我也将比个出家人还冷若冰霜。苏菲亚啊，我要的只是苏菲亚！这个名字 带给我多么大的喜悦啊！我要把它刻在每一棵树上。”
说到这里他一跃而起，看见了一一不是他的苏菲亚，也不是穿起盛装 丽服被选入土耳其皇帝后宫的一位塞尔加西亚姑娘；不，走过来的原来是 毛丽•西格里姆一一手持叉耙，身上穿的也不是长衫，而是件料子最粗的麻 布衬衣，也不大干净，上面还散发着一天劳动积下的汗臭。我们的主人公 拔出小刀，正准备（像前边提过的）往树上刻苏菲亚的名字，那姑娘走到
跟前，笑盈盈叫道："少爷，我希望您不是要杀我吧！"琼斯回答说："你为 什么想到我要杀你？"毛丽说："上回见面的时候，您对我那么狠，如今就 是杀了我也是对我大发慈悲哩。”
于是，两人谈判开了。不过我认为没有必要去叙述这段经过，所以这 里就从略了。总之，他们足足谈了一刻钟，谈完就躲到绿荫深丛里去了。
有些读者容或觉得这件事未免不近人情，不过它却是千真万确的。也 许可以这样来解释：在琼斯看来，有个女人总比没有女人强，而毛丽则可 能认为两个汉子总比一个强。关于汤姆目前的行径，除开上述动机，读者 也尽可以多从琼斯的方面去回顾一下：他此刻并不能自由运用理性这股神 奇的力量，而明智、严肃的人正是靠这股力量来克制自己的情欲，拒绝不 应享受的欢娱的。酒完全夺去了琼斯的这种能力。他当前的景况是：倘若 理性出来过问，即使仅仅劝告一下，也会得到多年前一个叫克柳斯特拉斯 的人对一个蠢人所作的答复。蠢人问他："喝醉了酒，你不觉得害臊 吗？”克柳斯特拉斯却说："公然来训斥一个醉酒的人，你难道不觉得害臊 吗？”老实说，在国家的法庭上，不能拿醉酒作为犯罪的借口；可是在良心 的法庭上，这事却大大可以谅解。因此，当亚里士多德推崇规定对酒后犯 罪加倍处罚的毕塔克斯图法时，也承认这条法律出于策略多于合乎公道。倘 若有哪一种罪过因醉酒而可以得到宽恕的话，那么琼斯先生当前犯的就正 是这样的罪过。要是这个题目对读者确实饶有兴味或者足以增进知识的 话，我倒大可搬用一下自己在这方面的渊博学问。如今，为了照顾读者， 我姑且把这份学问收将起来，仍旧书归正传吧。
曾经有人指出过：命运女神无论做什么事，从不半途而废。老实说， 不拘是讨人欢喜还是招人恼怒，她的花样都是无穷无尽的。我们的主人公 刚刚和他的黛都向隐藏进去，只见
Speluncam Blifil dux et divinus eandem
Deveniunt-[34]
正在庄重地散着步的牧师和少爷，也刚走到那片树丛的入口，就在这对情 侣钻了进去的当儿，恰好给少爷瞅见了。
尽管布利非离得还有一百多码，可是他清清楚楚地认出是琼斯，也看 见跟琼斯一道的是个女人，虽然他不能肯定是谁。他吓了一跳，在胸前画
了十字，极其庄重地惊叫一声。
布利非突然这一感叹，屠瓦孔觉得很奇怪，就问他是怎么回事。布利 非回答说，他瞅见一个汉子和一个野女人躲到树丛里去了，准是去干什么 下流勾当。至于琼斯的名字，他想最好还是先不去提一一个中道理只好留 待贤明的读者去判断了。因为倘若没有确凿把握，对人们的行动我们是轻 易不愿判定其动机的。
牧师不但本人严守礼法，对旁人的荒唐行为也是深恶痛绝的。听到布 利非这话，他就勃然大怒，要布利非先生马上领他到那个地方，一面走， —面嘴巴里还连叹气带咒骂着。他甚至隐隐指摘奥尔华绥先生，说这一带 风气越来越坏，主要都是他纵容姑息，对一个私生子拼命施恩造成的；公 正的、维护道德的法律本来规定对淫荡女人要加以重惩，他却从宽处理。
这两位猎人追踪的路上长满了荆棘，走起来十分碍事，并且会发出沙 沙的响声。这样，琼斯事先就觉察他们的到来，不至于叫他们弄个措手不 及。事实上，屠瓦孔是如此之按捺不住自己的一腔怒火，他每走一步必骂 —声，仅仅这一点就使琼斯了解到，（用一句猎人的行话）他正伏窝时被 人逮着了。
第十一章
用蒲伯先生嘲讽的“一哩长句”[35】开头，写出在不动刀枪的情况 下打得最剧烈的一场血战
正如在发情（这是个粗字眼，一般指汉普郡盛产木材[约的树林里兽类情 侣之间的文雅挑逗）季节，要是当头角峥嵘的公鹿想玩玩爱情的把戏，而 —对小狗或是旁的带有敌意的兽类在这座兽界爱神之宫左近徘徊，使得母 鹿赶忙跑开一一不管是出于恐怖或是嬉戏，腼腆还是活泼，总之，造物用 这些把所有的女性装饰起来，或者至少教她们学会装腔作势，免得由于男 性的粗俗，让肮脏的眼睛窥见撒摩斯囹的奥秘，因为在维吉尔（那时，他想 必正在为庆典而忙得不可开交）的诗句中，举行这种仪式时，女祭司就伴 随女方嚷道：
-Procul, o procul este, profani ；
Proclamat vates, totoque absistite luco.回
――女先知叫道，走开吧；
秽浊的灵魂，不许进这树林。[39]
——屈莱顿
我说，倘若那公鹿和它的情侣正在举行genusomne animantium四 所共同的神圣仪式的时候，竟有怀着敌意的野兽胆敢凑近，那么公鹿一经 从受惊的母鹿那里得到暗示，就会立即凶猛地冲到丛林入口，摆开架势来 捍卫它的情侣，四蹄跺着地，椅角乱晃，傲然向它所发觉的敌人挑战。
我们的主人公看到敌人走近的时候就是这样一一而且比这样更加可怕 地跳上前去。他往前跨出好几步去，为的是好藏起那只战栗着的母鹿；如 果可能，就掩护她撤退。这时，屠瓦孔先从他那双冒火的眼睛里闪出几道 青光，然后咆哮道："岂有此理！岂有此理！琼斯先生，怎么可能会是你 呢？”琼斯说："您瞧，我也可能会到这儿来的。"屠瓦孔说："那么请问， 跟你在一道的那个烂女人是谁？”琼斯大声说："要是有什么烂女人跟我在 —起，我有可能就不让你知道她是谁。”屠瓦孔说："我命令你马上告诉
我！小伙子，尽管从年龄上说，你已经不怎么需要监护了，然而你不要以 为老师就完全不能管教你了。师生这种关系像其他关系一样，是永不变更 的，因为都是上天规定的。所以我要叫你认识，今天你必须像我刚教你认 字的时候那样服从我。”琼斯大声说："我相信，你当然是想叫我这么认 识。可是除非你能再用桦木板子说服我，我是决不会听你的了。"屠瓦孔 说："那么就干脆对你说吧，我非要查出那个烂女人来不可。”琼斯回答 说："那么我也干脆告诉你吧，决不让你查出来。"屠瓦孔想要上前，琼斯 一把抓住他的膀子，布利非先生就动手去搪，声言他不能眼睁睁看着上了 年纪的老师受侮辱不管。
琼斯现在看出自己必须对付两个人，想想最好还是及早先摆脱一个。 他就从顶弱的下手，先丢下牧师，对准那年轻绅士的胸脯就是一拳。打得 正是地方，布利非立刻就倒下了。
屠瓦孔一心一意要查出那个烂女人来，因此，琼斯一松开手，他就不 顾战友如何，笔直朝凤尾草丛中奔去。可是他刚走进草丛几步，琼斯就已 经把布利非打倒，赶上去拖住屠瓦孔外衣的下摆。
这位牧师年轻的时候原是个击拳能手，在中学和大学里，曾凭一双拳 头赢得过不少荣誉。自然，多年来他都不曾运用这份高尚的技艺了，不过 他的勇气和他的信心同样坚强，而他的体格也不逊色。同时，读者也许已 经感觉到：他的性子还有些暴躁。当他回过头来，看到同来的伙伴直挺挺 地倒在地上，同时自己又受到以前每逢冲突时对他还只是消极抵抗的家伙 这般无理（这种情况使整个事态更形严重起来），就再也按捺不住了。他 摆出进攻的架势，使出全副气力，像以前打琼斯的后背那么凶猛地正面朝 他扑来。
我们的主人公面对敌人的攻势，一往无前，毫不畏缩。屠瓦孔咚地在 他胸脯上打了一拳，琼斯马上同样凶猛地也对准牧师的胸脯一拳打去。可 是屠瓦孔灵巧地往下一拦，这一拳就打到他的肚子上了一一这里面正装着 两磅牛肉和同样数量的布丁，所以并没咚咚作响。双方都重重挨了不少拳 头一一这情景，亲眼看到要比去描写或读那描写更轻松愉快。最后，两个 猛然摔倒在地，琼斯的膝头撞在屠瓦孔的胸口上。牧师气力不支了。这么 一来，胜负本来已见分晓，可是布利非偏偏这时又缓过气来，重新加入战 斗，由于他去和琼斯交手，牧师得以乘机摇晃摇晃脑袋，喘息一阵。
现在，两个一齐向我们的主人公攻击了；而琼斯经过和屠瓦孔一场扭 打之后，气力大减，拳头的份量已远不如前。那位塾师尽管更喜欢在人体 乐器上独奏，并且近来也只表演这一项，可是他依旧保持着往日二重奏座的 本领，表演得极为熟练。
按照现时的习惯，胜负可能就得由人数的众寡来决定了，可是突然间 战场上又出现了一对拳头，并且马上朝着牧师奉上。拳头的主人随打随嚷 着："妈的，两个揍一个，你们不怕丢脸吗？"
这场战斗（为了表示其不同一般，应该把它列入"大会战"一类）异常 猛烈地持续了几分钟，直到布利非再度为琼斯打得爬不起来，屠瓦孔才向 新来的敌手告饶。这会子才知道：来的正是魏斯顿先生。适才在激战中， 谁也没认出他来。
这位正直的乡绅今天下午和几个伙伴到郊外去散步，恰巧路过激战的 场所。既然看到三个人在交手，他料到一定是两个打一个。于是，就撇下 伙伴，只顾正义不问利害地加入势单力孤的一边。很可能就亏得他这一豪 侠举动，琼斯先生才没成为屠瓦孔的愤怒和布利非力尽师生之谊的牺牲 品。因为琼斯不但在人数上处于不利的地位，而且自从那只胳膊折断以 来，力气一直还没完全恢复过来。可是有了援军，战斗不久就告结束，琼 斯和他的盟友取得了胜利。
第十二章
一幕惊心动魄的情景，即使把屠瓦孔和布利非，或者二十个这类人 的血全流出来，看了也不会令人这么感动
战斗一结束，跟魏斯顿一道来的那些人就走过来了。其中有我们曾经 在魏斯顿先生的餐桌上见过的那位好牧师、苏菲亚的姑妈魏斯顿女士和可 爱的苏菲亚本人。
这时候，血迹斑斑的战场上呈现着这样一幅图景：一处是战败者布利 非面色苍白、奄奄一息地躺在地上。旁边站着胜利者琼斯，几乎浑身都是 血迹，一部分当然是他自己的，一部分不久前还属于屠瓦孔牧师先生。第 三处站的就是这位屠瓦孔先生，像波鲁斯王也那样怏怏不乐地向他的征服者 屈服了。图景中最后一个人物是伟大的魏斯顿，他十分豪迈地对手下败将 表示着宽宏大量。
大家最关切的首先是看来仿佛已一命呜呼的布利非，特别是魏斯顿女 士。她从衣袋里掏出一瓶鹿茸精，刚要亲自往他鼻孔里撒，突然间大家的 注意力从可怜的布利非身上转移开了；倘若他的灵魂真有意要溜到另外那 个世界去的话，这时倒大可以不辞而别哩。
原来一个更值得怜惜、更可爱的人儿僵直地躺到他们面前了。这不是 旁人，正是美丽的苏菲亚。她也许由于看到血迹，或是担心她的父亲，要 不就是旁的原因，在谁也没来得及搀扶之前，就晕倒在地了。
头一个发现的是魏斯顿女士。她马上喊叫起来。接着，另外两三个人 也一齐嚷着："魏斯顿小姐死啦。"立时喊起要鹿茸精，要水，要各种急救 用品。
读者或许还记得，在描写这片丛林时，我们提到过一道淙淙溪流，这 道溪流可与一般传奇里的流水迥乎不同，它并不只是发出淙淙水声而已。 不，命运女神注定要让这道小溪的名望远胜于所有流过阿凯迪亚四平原的小 溪。
琼斯正在揉布利非的太阳穴，担心那一拳打得太重了。这当儿，"魏斯 顿小姐”和"死”这样的字眼一下子灌入他的耳里。琼斯立刻丢下布利非，随 他去死活，就朝苏菲亚奔去。大家正在东跑西颠，你冲我撞，在极干的小 径上寻水，琼斯却一把抱起苏菲亚，跨过一片野地就来到上述的那道小溪 边。他一直蹚进去，拼命往苏菲亚的脸上、头部和颈部撩清水。
苏菲亚那些伙伴由于惊慌失措，没采取任何办法来救她；幸喜同样由 于惊慌失措，他们也没对琼斯加以阻拦。等他把苏菲亚抱到中途，他们才 明白他要干什么；实际上他们还没走到溪边，琼斯早已把她救活了。正当 苏菲亚的父亲、姑妈和牧师来到时，她伸了伸胳膊，睁开眼睛叫了声："天 哪！ ”
琼斯一直把可爱的苏菲亚抱在怀里，这时才松开了手。可是就在松开 的时候，他带着深情抚摸了苏菲亚一下。倘若小姐的神志已经完全清醒过 来，这自然不会不被她觉察。既然她对这种放肆没表示什么愠意，我们也 就很可以假定当时她还没清醒过来。
一场悲剧转瞬之间变为欢乐场面了，而我们的主人公自然是其中一名 主要角色。琼斯从救苏菲亚一命所感到的喜悦也许更甚于被救起的苏菲亚 本人；同样，向小姐祝贺的人也远不如向琼斯祝贺的多。尤其魏斯顿先 生，他搂了搂女儿，就对琼斯又是拥抱又是亲吻。他说琼斯是苏菲亚的救 命恩人，并且宣布除了苏菲亚和他的田产，琼斯要什么他没有不肯给的。 说完这话他又寻思了一下，说还除开他的猎犬和"斯劳赤小姐"一一他是这 么称呼他那匹心爱的母马的。
乡绅对苏菲亚的一切担心都已经消除，于是，就一心一意关心起琼斯 来。"来吧，孩子，"魏斯顿说，"脱下衣服来，洗洗脸去！你可真是一塌糊 涂！快去洗洗，然后跟我一道回去吧。得找一件衣服给你换换。”
琼斯立刻照办了。他甩下衣服，走到溪边，把脸和胸脯都洗了洗一一 胸脯和脸一样露在外头，也是血迹斑斑的。水虽然把血迹洗掉了，却洗不 掉屠瓦孔在他脸上和胸脯上留下的青一块黑一块的伤痕。苏菲亚看到了， 不禁叹息一声，用无以言状的深情望了他一眼。
这一切，琼斯都看在眼里，在他心坎上留下的印象远比挨的打要深得 多，感受也大大不同一一那么温柔、体贴，即使他刚才全是为刀所刺，一 时也感觉不到痛苦了。
这时，大家全往回走，马上就来到先前那个地方，屠瓦孔刚把布利非 先生弄得直起身子来。写到这里我们无法抑制心中一个诚恳的希望：但愿 世人遇有争执，只使用造物为我们准备下的那些武器来较量一一她晓得什 么对我们最为相宜；至于那无情的铁器，让它只用于破开大地的腑脏，别 拿来对付活人吧。那样，专制帝王用以消遣解闷的战争就没这么有害了。 几位贵妇人一阵心血来潮，也尽可以叫一支支大军交起锋来，而且她们以
及国王还可以实地观赏一下这场冲突。这样，战场上一下子横尸遍野，可 是再过一会儿，阵亡了的，或者其中绝大部分，又会像贝雅斯先生绅的队伍 那样站了起来，按照事先安排好的，随着一阵鼓声或琴声整队开走。
要是可能的话，我倒很想一本正经地来对待这个问题，免得那些对谐 谑素来抱反感的庄重人士和政治家们会说是胡扯；然而事实上，一场战斗 并不取决于哪一方多制造了几堆血肉狼藉的尸体，用打破的头颅、流血的 鼻子和乌青的眼睛的多寡又何尝不能判断胜负？难道不可以凭借这种方式 来争夺城池？诚然，这种方案可能会被认为不利于法国，因为这么一来， 他们就要失却在工业技术方面对别国的优势了；可是当我想到那个民族的 慷慨豪迈的性格时，我相信他们决不会拒绝在实力上与交手的对方处于势 均力敌的地位，或者用句成语来说，就是让对方跟自己旗鼓相当。
不过，这样的改革只好想想而已，却不能真寄以期望。顺便提这么一 句，下面还是书归正传。
魏斯顿问起适才吵架的根由，布利非和琼斯都不作声。屠瓦孔却悻悻 地回答说："要想找出根由，我看它远在千里，近在眼前。您只需在这附近 搜索一下，就准可以把她找到的。"魏斯顿说："怎么，把她找到？难道你 们是为一个婊子吵起架来了吗？”屠瓦孔说："去问那位穿背心的先生吧， 他知道得最清楚。"魏斯顿嚷道："这么说来，准是个婊子喽。啊，汤姆， 汤姆，你可真是个荒唐鬼！算了吧，各位先生。大家还是朋友，都跟我回 去吃杯和气酒吧。"屠瓦孔说："对不起，先生，这可不能遵命。以我这样 的身份，只为了尽我做老师的责任而去追查那个娼妇，让她受到法律的制 裁，竟然受到这个小子如此的侮辱，如此的殴打，这决不是一件小事！不 过，事情主要还是错在奥尔华绥先生和您身上。如果您尽到职责，按照法 律办事，这一带的祸害马上就可以除掉的。”
"我宁可把这一带的狐狸先除掉，"魏斯顿大声说。"依我看来，战场上 天天都死掉不少人，应该鼓励大家来补充补充才是。不过，汤姆，那娘儿 们在哪儿？你指给我看！"说着，他就用轰出野兔的叫喊和办法四下里搜寻 起来。最后嚷道："嗬唷，兔子没跑远。啊呀，这准就是它的窝！我敢保证 它已经跑掉了。"事情正是这样。原来乡绅发现的是那可怜的姑娘在打架开 始的时候偷偷逃掉的地方，她就像兔子那样连蹦带跳地仓皇逸去。
苏菲亚如今央求她父亲回家去，说她觉得很虚弱，恐怕会晕倒。乡绅 马上依从女儿的话，他对女儿是极为疼爱的。他恳切邀请大家同他一道回
去用饭。可是布利非和屠瓦孔坚决地拒绝了。前者说，他不能奉陪，理由 很多，一时不便说明；后者则表示（也许不无道理），他那样职务的人， 以目前的那副模样无论在哪里出现也不相宜。
对于和苏菲亚相聚这种快事，琼斯总是难以谢绝的，所以他就随魏斯 顿乡绅以及女眷们一同走去，牧师殿后。这位先生本表示要留下来陪伴屠 瓦孔兄弟，说两人都是供神职的，不便撇下同道自行走开；可是屠瓦孔不 肯领这份情，而且不大客气地推了他一把，让他跟魏斯顿先生一道走。
这场血战到此了结，我们这部历史的第五卷也就此告终。

第六卷
三个星期左右的事
第一章
论爱情
在上一卷里，我们不得不讲了不少关于爱情的话。在这一卷里，我们 还得把这个问题谈得更多一些。因此，我们在这里来探讨一下某些哲学家 宣称他们在其他种种出色的发现之外所找到的新学说，倒也未必不妥当。 这种学说就是：在人类的胸膛里，根本没有爱这种情感。
我在这里不便妄加臆断，究竟这些哲学家与承蒙已故的斯威夫特［1］博士 提到的那个惊人的学派是否一个样，据说他们丝毫不假学力，甚至连书本 也不翻一翻，光凭天才居然就发掘出一个深奥而价值无穷的秘密：根本没 有上帝；或者他们毋宁说是跟几年前曾证明人性中实际上无所谓道德或仁 慈、认为人类一切善行都出乎自我炫耀，因而震动世界的那些人⑵一样。实 际上，我认为所有这些形形色色的寻求真理者与别人所说的淘金者是同一 类的人：双方使用的手段完全相同，都是在一个龌龊的地方寻找、搜索和 勘查；而寻求真理者找到的又是最龌龊的角落：一颗坏心。
可是尽管就方法或者就成果而言，寻求真理者与淘金者比在一起十分 恰当，然而在谦逊方面，二者就没有比较可言了。谁曾听说过一个淘金者 会由于自家采探落了空，就唐突地或是愚蠢地断言世上根本就没有金子这 么个玩意儿呢？然而寻求真理者在他自己的心灵那座粪堆里四处搜索也找 不到一丝一毫神圣、善良、仁慈和值得一爱或足以焕发起爱情的东西，于 是，就公然地、老老实实地、合情合理地断言：宇宙间根本不存在这种情 感。
为了尽量避免与这些哲学家（如果可以这么称呼他们的话）发生争 执，并且表明我们很愿意息事宁人，这里姑且对他们作一些让步，这样也 许可以结束争论。
第一，我们承认世上有许多人一一其中也许包括那些哲学家自己，他 们的心灵里丝毫也没有这种情感。
第二，也承认通常所谓的爱情，即用一定数量白皙而鲜嫩的人肉来餍 足贪婪的食欲，与我这里所论争的那种情感是风马牛不相及的；通常所谓 的那种，更确切些说，应当称之为饥饿。正如贪馋的人毫不害臊地把“爱 情"这个字眼用到食欲上，说他们爱某几道菜，同样地，具有这种"爱情”的 人也尽可以说，某些女人使他发馋。
第三，我还承认（这谅必是那些哲学家最乐于接受的一个让步）尽管 我为之辩护的这种爱情在取得满足的方式上要斯文多了，然而它要求得到 满足的程度并不亚于最粗鄙的食欲。
最后，我们也承认当这种爱情倾注在一个异性身上时，为了取得充分 的满足，它往往也会求助于上述那种饥饿；这样做不但不会减少爱情的乐 趣，反而会使这乐趣更为深厚一一深厚到那些仅仅懂得满足肉欲的人所难 以想象的地步。
既然我们作了这些让步，那么礼尚往来，也希望哲学家承认：有些人 （谅必不在少数）胸膛里存在着一种仁慈友爱的情感，它从促使旁人幸福 中得到满足；而只有在这种满足一一诸如朋辈间的友情，父母儿女间的天 伦之爱以及一般的慈善举动一一中，才能感到巨大而激烈的喜悦。这种情 感倘若不称之为爱，我们就再也找不到旁的称法了。尽管这种纯洁的爱情 所产生的快乐佐以色欲会更加强烈、甜蜜，然而没有色欲它依然能存在， 而掺加了色欲之后，也遭不到破坏。最后，尊敬和感激是爱情恰当的动 机，正如青春和美貌是欲望的诱因。因此，尽管对方年老或患病时欲望自 然而然地就没有了，爱情却丝毫受不到波及。在一颗善良的心灵里，以感 激和尊敬为基础而建立起来的感觉或情感，是既不能动摇也无法消灭的。
我们经常清清楚楚看到这种情感的实例，而又去否认它存在，似乎是 十分奇怪而荒谬的，这样做只能是出于上述的自我谴责，而这是多么冤枉 啊！倘若一个人在自己的胸膛里丝毫也看不到贪婪和野心，难道他就可以 断定人性里没有这种东西吗？在判断人家善恶的时候，我们为什么不虚心 地遵循同一准则？或者，我们为什么总像莎士比亚所说的那样"以自己的意 见代表众人”回？
这里，恐怕主要是严重的虚荣心在作祟。这是我们恭维自己心灵的一 个例子，并且几乎尽人皆然。不管一个人多么瞧不起说奉承话的人，可是 他奉承起自己来却可以降低到十分卑鄙的地步。
因此，上述观点是否正确，请衷心同意我所说的话的各位来决定。
亲爱的读者，请检查一下您的心灵，看看您是否跟我一样相信我所阐 发的这些论点。要是您相信的话，那么就请读下去，我们此后将继续印证 这些论点。要是您不相信的话，那么您所阅读的已经超过您的理解力了。 与其这么浪费光阴来读这既不合您的胃口又非您所能理解的东西，倒不如 去从事您的公干或者找点什么去消遣消遣。同您谈论爱情的效力必然和同
一个天生的盲人研究色彩一样荒谬；因为您对爱情的看法可能和盲人对绯 红色所抱的观念同样荒唐。我们听说，这样一位盲人曾认为那种颜色颇像 喇叭的声音[4],而爱情在您的心目中大约就酷似一盆汤或是一块烤牛腰肉。
第二章
魏斯顿女士的人品;她学问渊博，通达世故;一个足以表明她的真 知灼见的事例
上一卷里，读者看到魏斯顿先生同他的妹妹、女儿、年轻的琼斯和牧 师一道回到他的府上，大家快快活活欢聚的一个晚上，单只苏菲亚一个人 闷闷不乐。至于琼斯，尽管他也是满怀情思，可是想到奥尔华绥先生的康 复，他的意中人又近在咫尺，再加上苏菲亚不时送过来的温柔的目光，我 们的主人公也就兴致勃勃地跟另外三位同席的尽情欢乐起来，至于那三位 倒像是世上最快活不过的人了。
第二天用早饭的时候，苏菲亚脸上依然那么心事重重。她丢下她父亲 和姑姑，比往常早一些就退了席。乡绅并没理会到女儿情绪上的这种变 化。老实说，尽管他也搞些政治，曾两度参加地方上的竞选，其实，他的 观察能力却并不高明。他妹妹与他却迥乎不同。她曾出入宫廷，接触过上 流社会，因而把上流社会的一切知识都学到了。她精通他们的规矩、礼 数、习俗和风尚。她的学问还不仅这些。她博览群书，见识甚广，不但读 过当代所有的话剧、歌剧、宗教剧、诗歌和传奇，并对这些都曾有所评 论，并且还浏览过拉宾的《英国史》2、艾查尔德的《罗马史沪以及许多法 兰西的野史掌故之类。这以外，近二十年来出版的绝大部分政治小册子和 报刊她也读了。这种孜孜钻研使得她精通政治，谈论起欧洲大势来真是满 肚子的学问。在恋爱这门学问上，她的才能尤为卓绝。对于谁和谁相好这 类事，她比任何人消息都更灵通；由于她没有自己的恋爱来分心，所以就 更便于搜集旁人的情况。也许她不想恋爱，要不就是从没有人来追求她 ――后者更可能些，因为尽管她也穿裙子，长得却颇像个男人；她身高近 六叭，再加上她的举止和学问，也许使得男人不把她当作女人看待。然而 对这种事她也曾以科学的态度考虑过。她完全晓得（尽管她自己没使用 过）现今上流社会的妇女在鼓励对方或遮掩自己情意时所使用的各种手 法，诸如微笑、巧笑和使眉眼什么的。总之，任何掩饰或装模作样都瞒不 过她去。可是对于老实人的纯朴情感她却不大能理解，因为她从来也没见 识过。
就凭着这套察言观色的神奇本领，魏斯顿女士认为她在苏菲亚的心灵 里发现了一个隐秘。这印象最初是从小姐在战场上的举止得出来的。她那
时的疑心更为当晚以及第二天早晨她所看到的一切所证实了。然而她十分 慎重，唯恐弄错，把这件事在肚子里憋了足足有两个星期，只不过话里带 些旁敲侧击，嘿嘿笑上两声，点点头、挤挤眉眼而已，偶尔含含糊糊地露 出些话茬儿，这自然足够让苏菲亚大吃一惊的，可是却没让她哥哥觉出什 么来。
经过仔细观察，她终于确信自己所怀疑的完全属实。于是，一天早晨 乘她单独和她哥哥在一起的时候，魏斯顿女士就用下面一席话打断了他的 口哨声：
"哥哥，请问你可曾理会到我侄女近来神情很有些特别吗？"魏斯顿回 答说："不，我不曾理会到什么。难道咱们姑娘出了什么事吗？”她说："我 看是出事了，而且还不是小事。"魏斯顿嚷道："可她没说身上哪儿不舒服 呀！而且她已经出过天花的。"她说："哥哥，女孩子们除了出天花还会出 旁的毛病的，有时候也许比出天花还要厉害得多呢。"这时，魏斯顿十分着 急地打断了她的话，央求她说，要是姑娘闹了什么病，可得马上告诉他， 并且说："你晓得我爱她胜过自己的灵魂，我要走遍天涯海角替她请来最好 的大夫。"她笑了笑说："不用，不用，这病没那么可怕。不过，哥哥，你 现在总该承认我精于人情世故了吧。我侄女要是没深深地爱上什么人，那 我可是生平头一回闹这么大笑话。"魏斯顿气冲冲地嚷道："怎么，爱上了 人!爱上了人也不告诉我一声！我要取消她的继承权！把她赤条条地赶出 大门去，一个铜钱也不给她。我这么疼她，爱她，到头来居然不先问我一 声就爱上了人！"魏斯顿女士说："不过在你还不晓得她挑上的人中不中你 的意之前，可不能把你这心肝宝贝女儿赶出门去。要是她挑上的刚好是你 中意的人，那你就不会生她的气的。"魏斯顿说："对，对。那可就是两码 事了。她要是嫁给我要她嫁的那个人，那就随便她爱上谁都成。我才犯不 着为这事去伤脑筋哩。"他妹妹说："这才像个有见识的人说的话。不过， 我敢说她挑上的刚好也就是你想替她挑的那个人。要不是这样，那么就算 我这人没见过世面。哥哥，你总得承认我还是见过一些世面的吧。"魏斯顿 说："是呀，妹妹，我相信你的见识比得上任何一个女人一一当然，这也是 女人们的事。你晓得我可不爱听你谈政治，政治是我们男人的事，你们女 人家不应该多嘴多舌的。可是，告诉我，那个男人是谁呢？ ”她说："得 了，你自己查问去吧。你既然是这么一位大政治家，这件事办起来不会有 什么困难的。既然你的眼力这么好，国王内阁的机密你都能识破，又看得
出使欧洲一切政治机器转动起来的那些国家巨轮的秘密动力，那么去打听 —个单纯、幼稚的女孩子家的心事，当然不费吹灰之力。"乡绅嚷道："妹 妹，我对你讲过几遍了，别把宫廷那套话说给我听。干脆告诉你说，我不 懂你们那套行话。可是一般杂志和《伦敦晚报》我都能看懂的。自然，也 许有时候碰上一首诗我有点摸不着头脑，因为有一半字母都给省略掉了。 我十分明白他们干吗要这样，也就是说：由于贪污腐化，咱们本国的事不 大妙。"那女士叫着说："我打心里可怜你这乡下人的愚昧无知！"魏斯顿回 答说："我也可怜你那套城里人的学问。当什么都好，我就决不当个出入宫 廷的人，而且还是个长老会员，而且我相信，正和某些人一样，还是个汉 诺威派。她说："哥哥，你要是说我的话，你晓得我是个女人，我属于那 一派没多大关系。而且……"乡绅大声说："我晓得你是个女人，也幸亏你 是个女人；要是个男人的话，我早就给你一顿鞭子啦。哼，你自以为比 我们强的地方，也不过是那鞭子而已。你们男人只不过在体力上比我们强 些，而不是在脑力上。你们幸而能打过我们，不然的话，女人凭大大超过 男人的智慧很可以把所有的男人都变成奴隶一一就像那些勇敢、聪明、乖 巧、懂礼貌的男子那样……"乡绅说："知道了你这套想法，我倒是很高 兴。不过，咱们改日再谈这件事吧。眼下，先告诉我你认为我女儿爱上的 究竟是谁？”她说："等一等，让我先消消对你们男子无比的鄙夷，不然的 话，我连对你也会发脾气的。好啦，我想办法把这股怒火咽下去了。那么 我的高明的先生，你觉得布利非先生怎么样？苏菲亚看到他倒在地上昏迷 不醒，不是立刻就晕倒过去了吗？等布利非醒过来，我们来到他站着的草 地上，苏菲亚的脸色不是立刻变得一片苍白吗？而且那天吃晚饭的时候， 第二天早晨，甚至直到今天，苏菲亚一直都愁眉不展的。要不是爱上了什 么人，还能有什么旁的原因？……"乡绅大声说："哎呀！经你这么一指 点，我全想起来啦。一定就是这样，我十分高兴。我晓得苏菲亚是个好丫 头，她不会乱搞恋爱惹我生气的。我一辈子也没这么惬意过，因为我们两 家的田产紧挨着，再方便不过了。前些时候我也转过这个念头：看起来这 两份田产早已结了亲，把它们分开着实可惜。固然在英国还有更大的田 产，可咱们这一郡另外却找不到了。我宁可吃点亏也不愿意把女儿嫁到外 乡或者外国去。而且这种大庄园多半都在贵族手里，我最恨贵族啦。不 过，妹妹，你说说我该怎么办呢？这种事儿你们女人家比我们在行。"那位 女士说："哦，诚惶诚恐！蒙您居然承认我们女人也有一技之长，真是感激
涕零。既然您一一高明的先生不耻下问，那么我看您不妨亲自登门到奥尔 华绥先生家去提亲。双方的家长都可以提亲，这没什么不合体统的。在蒲 伯先生译的《奥德修纪》［8］里，阿吉诺王就曾表示要把自己的女儿嫁给尤利 西斯。像你这么精明的人，当然用不着我来提醒：别对旁人说你的女儿害 起相思病，那可就大失体统了。"乡绅说："好吧，我向他提亲去。不过要 是他不答应的话，就得吃我一顿鞭子。"魏斯顿女士大声说："不用担心。 这么有利的亲事没人会不答应的。……"乡绅说："这倒难说，奥尔华绥是 个怪物。金钱打动不了他。"她说："你的政治眼光拙劣得真是惊人！难道 人家嘴里说什么，你就信什么吗？难道就因为奥尔华绥先生口头上多说了 几句唾弃金钱的话，你就真会受骗，以为他比旁的人更看不起金钱吗？要 是一个软弱的女人这么轻信，还说得过去；可是像你们这样聪明的男子 ――天生的政治家，怎么会这样呢？真的，哥哥，要是派你当全权大使去 跟法国人谈判，你一定会干得很出色的！他们很快就会把你给说服，让你 相信他们攻人城池只不过是出于自卫。"乡绅十分鄙夷地说："妹妹，让你 那些宫廷里的朋友去承担城池失守的责任吧。你既然是个女人家，我就不 怪你了，因为我相信他们决不会蠢到让女人来参与机密大事的。”说到这 里，他十分轻蔑地笑了笑，使魏斯顿女士终于受不住了。她哥哥的话句句 都触到她的痛处（因为她对这类事务确实+分精通，而且态度非常激 烈），所以就勃然大怒，骂她哥哥是个小丑和糊涂虫，说她再也不能在他 家住下去了。
尽管乡绅也许从来没读过马基雅弗利［9］的著作，然而他在许多方面却是 个+足的政治家。他对交易巷也里逍遥政治学派M所宣扬的那些高明学说， 无不竭力拥护。他懂得金钱的真正价值和唯一用途就是积攒起来。他完全 了解财产复归权M和可望继承的产权的价值。他时常在估量他妹妹名下的那 份产业，并算计着他自己或是他的子女继承的可能性。以他的精明，决不 会因这点小争执就抛弃一切的。因此，他一发觉自己说话过了火，马上就 想法来缓和一下局势。这也不是什么难事，因为魏斯顿女士一向对哥哥很 有感情，对侄女更是疼爱；尽管她认为自己十分熟悉政治，在这方面要受 到冒犯，就很容易恼火，然而她毕竟是一位十分好心肠、好脾气的女人。
因此，乡绅先到马棚里，把马拴好，除了窗口，各处都关得严严实 实，让马逃不出去，然后才回来对付他妹妹。他收回刚才所说的一切，又 讲了许多与刚才触怒她的言辞完全相反的话，对她百般安抚。最后，他又
叫口齿伶俐的苏菲亚来帮忙，她说的话不但娓娓动听，而且也是她姑妈特 别欢喜听的。她说什么，魏斯顿女士总更容易听进耳去。
结果，魏斯顿女士温和地笑了笑说："哥哥，你真是十足的克罗地亚人 0!但是正如那些人在女王陛下也的军队里有他们的用处，你也有你的长 处。所以我就再跟你签一次和约，看看你那方面会不会再次毁约。你既然 是一位那么了不起的政治家，我想，至少我可以期望你像法国人那样，对 条约能够遵守到利害关系逼得你毁约为止。”
第三章
其中包含两点对批评家的挑战
乡绅同他的妹妹和解（如我们在上章所看到的）之后，恨不得马上就 上奥尔华绥家去提亲。魏斯顿女士好不容易才拦住他，没让他在别人病中 去办这类事。
奥尔华绥先生是正当他答应到魏斯顿先生家来吃饭的时候病倒的。所 以一停止吃药，他立刻就想到应该践约一一不论是最显贵还是最寒微的 人，他向来都是这样对待的。
从上一章乡绅兄妹的谈话到这次宴会这段时间里，苏菲亚听了她姑妈 话语之间影影绰绰冒出的某些暗示，有点担心，恐怕这位机警的女人已经 识破她对琼斯的爱情。这时，苏菲亚决计要乘机把她这种疑窦一扫而光， 因而一举一动都竭力加以控制。
第一，为了掩饰她那颗惆怅郁闷的心，她在神态间故意装作十分轻松 活泼。第二，她总是和布利非先生谈天说地，整天也不睬可怜的琼斯一 下。
乡绅看到女儿这种举止，高兴得简直什么也顾不上吃，只一个勤儿地 对他妹妹点头"夹 眼表示赞许。他妹妹看到这情形，最初可并不像乡绅 那么高兴。
一句话，苏菲亚做得过了头，起初反而使她姑妈有点吃惊了。她开始 怀疑侄女是不是故作姿态。但因为她自己向来就善于造作，她立刻就认定 苏菲亚也准是在尽力表演。她想起自己曾多次向侄女暗示，说她在害相 思，小姐谅必是要用过分的殷勤来消除姑妈的猜疑一一苏菲亚那过度的轻 松愉快更加证实了她这个想法。这里，我们不得不指出：倘若苏菲亚在葛 罗沃诺尔方场M的环境里住上十年，她姑妈这种臆测就会更有根据了，因为 那一带的年轻女士们确实学得一手玩弄爱情的好把戏――而在离伦敦一百 哩的深林幽谷里，这可是一件十分严肃的事。
老实说，若要发现旁人的诡计，重要的是把我们的心弦（如果可以这 么说的话）调得跟旁人的心弦合了拍，因为十分狡猾的人有时也会由于把 旁人的智力估计得过高（也就是把旁人看作更大的坏蛋）而上当。这个论
点颇为深奥，所以我要用下面这个小故事来说明。三个同乡穿过布伦特福 尔德镇也，追赶一个威尔特郡叫的小偷。其中一个头脑顶简单的，看到一块 招牌下写着"威尔特郡旅店"，就劝同伴们进去，他认为他们那个小偷可能 躲在里面。他的一个同伴比他精明一些，笑他想得未免太简单了。可那第 三个人更加聪明，他说："咱们还是进去找吧，因为那家伙也许以为咱们总 不会相信他会躲到同乡当中去的。”于是他们就进去搜查。原来当时小偷离 他们前边不远，这么一搜，就再也不用想追上他了。其实，三个乡下人都 晓得那个小偷根本不识字，可是他们一直忽略了这一点。
请读者原谅这段题外之言。为了向大家透露一个极有价值的秘密，我 们不得不这样做：因为每个赌徒都必然会同意，若要将计就计，击败对 方，必须十分熟习对方的手法。这个道理还可以说明何以聪明人反而被并 不那么聪明的人所骗过，天真淳朴的人往往倒遭到误会和曲解。可是最重 要的，还在于这个道理足以说明何以苏菲亚竟然把她那位精明强干的姑妈 蒙混过去了。
用完饭，大家就到花园里去散心。魏斯顿先生以为他妹妹对他讲的那 些话千真万确，就把奥尔华绥先生拉到一边，贸然向他提出苏菲亚和布利 非少爷的亲事。
奥尔华绥先生并不像世上某一种人，骤然间听到什么意外的物质利 益，就心花缭乱起来。他的心灵确实具备着符合男子汉和基督教徒身份的 哲学修养。他并不装作把苦乐悲欢一概置之度外，然而也从不为一时的意 外得失、运气好坏而为之变化。因此，听到魏斯顿先生提亲的话，他心情 宁静，神色也一点没有改变。他说他由衷地希望这门亲事能够结成，然后 恰当地称赞了一番那位小姐的人品，也承认从财产上来说，这亲事对男方 是有利的。他先感谢魏斯顿先生对他外甥的抬举，然后表示要是两个年轻 人彼此都中意，他是很乐于成全这桩婚姻的。
魏斯顿听到奥尔华绥先生的答话并不像他所料想的那么热切，有些失 望。奥尔华绥先生对于两个年轻人彼此会不会中意这一点像是还没把握， 魏斯顿以鄙夷的态度对待这种怀疑。他说：子女应和谁配偶，再没有比做 父母的更善于判断的了。至于他这方面，他要求女儿对他百依百顺：这么 好的媳妇要是哪个小伙子不愿意要，那就随他去吧，但愿这么说说没冒犯 着谁。
奥尔华绥说了好多赞美苏菲亚的话来缓和魏斯顿的气恼，说他毫不怀 疑布利非先生对这门亲事一定会十分高兴的，可是怎么说也不中用。除 了"我不再多说什么了一一但愿没冒犯着谁一一算了吧"，再也听不到魏斯 顿讲旁的什么话。分手之前，这几句话他至少说了一百遍。
奥尔华绥十分熟悉这位邻居的为人，自然不会见怪。尽管他非常不赞 成某些做父母的为了婚姻对子女施加压力，他自己曾下决心决不强迫外甥 去做什么，可他还是很愿意这门亲事能够结成，因为苏菲亚在那一带真是 有口皆碑，他自己对这位小姐卓越的品貌，也是十分钦佩的。此外还可以 想到，苏菲亚的巨大家当也在考虑之内；虽然奥尔华绥先生不会为这一点 所陶醉，然而他是个通情达理的人，也不会把财产看作粪土。
这里，不管批评家们怎样叫嚣，我偏要就什么是真正的智慧这个问 题，说几句题外之话一一在这方面，奥尔华绥先生是个伟大的典范，正像 他在仁慈方面是个典范一样。
不管贺加斯先生那个穷诗人也写了多少反对财富的诗篇，也不论酒足饭 饱的阔牧师们在讲坛上如何斥责享乐，真正的智慧绝不蔑视这二者。一个 家资万贯的人尽可以和街头乞丐具有同样的智慧，一个拥有娇妻或挚友的 人，在智慧上也照样可以比得上一个埋葬自己的社会功能、食不果腹、狠 狠地鞭打自己脊背的乖张的天主教隐士。
老实说，世上最聪明的人最可能极大限度地拥有人间一切幸福。因为 智慧所指示的中庸之道是获得有益的财富的最可靠的道路，而只有这样才 能使我们享受种种乐趣。聪明人总使他的欲望、情感样样都得到满足，可 是蠢人为了餍足一种欲望却不惜牺牲其他一切。
也许有人不赞成我这个见解，认为有些十分聪明的人却是臭名昭著的 贪财鬼。我的回答是：在这一点上他们就算不得聪明。还会有人说，极聪 明的人年轻时曾恣情纵欲。我的回答是：他们当时并不聪明。
尽管那些从没进过智慧之内的人把智慧说成极不容易学到，简言之， 它只不过教我们把一句众所周知、连社会的底层都普遍恪守的简单格言运 用得比日常生活更广泛一些而已。这句格言就是：不可以过高的代价购 买。
凡是带着这句格言步入世界这个广大的集市并且不断地把它应用于这 个集市所提供的名、利、享受以及其他货品的人，我敢断言都是聪明人 ――就世人对这个词儿的理解，大家也必然会公认他是这样。因为他做了
—笔最合算的生意：付出的代价很少，却把上述一切好货色都带回家去， 同时还保全了他的健康、清白和名声，毫无损伤一一而这些正是一般人在 谋求名、利、享受时往往要付出的代价。
他从这种中庸之道中，还得到另外两个教训，使他的品格更臻于完 善。第一，如做成一笔极合算的生意，决不可得意忘形；其次，如市集上 无货可买或者货品贵得买不起，也不可垂头丧气。
不过，我别忘记自己在写什么了，不能离题太远，让好性子的批评家 也无法忍受了。因此，这一章就此打住。
第四章
几件稀奇古怪的事
奥尔华绥先生一回到家里，就把布利非少爷叫到一旁。几句话慢慢引 到魏斯顿先生提亲这件事，同时，他也告诉外甥自己是很赞成这门亲事 的。
布利非丝毫也不曾为苏菲亚的姿色所动。这倒不是因为他心上早已有 了旁人，也不是由于他迟钝如木石或是生性讨厌女人，只不过他生来善于 调度自己的欲望，倚靠哲理、读书或其他办法，能够毫不费力地克制住自 己。至于本卷第一章里所谈的那种情感，在他的整个天性里连一星半点儿 也找不到。
尽管他丝毫也没有我们前面谈过的（也就是最容易为苏菲亚的品貌所 吸引的）那种复杂情感，然而他却富于另外一种情感，这种情感从小姐名 下的财产中得到了充分的满足，就是贪婪和野心，这二者平分了他的心 灵。他先前就不止一次考虑过，能把那片家业据为己有是再好不过了，甚 至还从长远作过计较；不过他自己年纪还轻，小姐也是如此，更主要的是 他担心魏斯顿先生也许还会续弦，生出旁的孩子，所以一直迟疑不决，没 有贸然进行。
如今，既然魏斯顿先生自己上门来提亲，后一个（也是关系最大的） 顾虑就几乎可以打消了。因此，布利非沉吟了一刻，就回复奥尔华绥先生 说：婚姻这件事他倒还没考虑过，不过他极其感念舅父对他的亲切、慈祥 的关怀，凡是舅父乐意的事，他无不从命。
奥尔华绥本是个热情的人。他现在的这种庄重态度原是出于真知灼见 和洞明哲理，并不是因为他生性冷淡。年轻时候他也曾满怀激情，为着爱 情而和一个漂亮女人结了婚。所以他对外甥这么冷淡的回答不很高兴。他 不禁满口称道起苏菲亚，并且表示除非布利非心上另外有了人，不然的 话，对这般可爱的人竟然无动于衷，真是不可思议的。
布利非告诉他舅父，自己心上确实没有旁人，然后他就大发了一通关 于恋爱和结婚问题的议论，说得那样精明，合乎教义，便是一个父亲，如 果不及他舅父那么虔诚，也一定会给他堵上嘴巴的。最后，那位忠厚长者 相信他的外甥不但对苏菲亚没什么挑剔，并且还尊敬她，而在明智、高尚 的心灵中，尊敬才是友谊和爱情可靠的基础。既然他相信这位情郎不久就
可以获得苏菲亚的欢心，他估量这门称心如意的亲事一定会给各方面的人 都带来极大的幸福。因此，在布利非少爷的同意下，第二天早晨他就给魏 斯顿先生写了一封信，说他的外甥满怀感激和欣喜的心情同意了这亲事， 并且只要小姐肯于赏光接见，他随时都准备登门造访。
魏斯顿看了这信，十分高兴。他立刻写了回信。他事先没向女儿提一 个字，在信中就指定当天下午来揭开求婚这一幕。
他刚打发人把信送去，就来找他妹妹。她正在那里边读《新闻通报》 四，边向撒波尔牧师讲解着。尽管乡绅天生性子很急，也只好按捺住，足足 听她宣讲了一刻钟才找到开口的机会。魏斯顿于是对他妹妹说，他有一件 很重要的事要告诉她。她回答说："哥哥，任凭你吩咐吧。看来北方的形势 很好，我的情绪再愉快不过了。”
这时，牧师辞去，魏斯顿就把一切经过全告诉了她，并要她去转告苏 菲亚。她立刻欣然答应下来。不过，乡绅也许应该感谢北方的形势使得他 妹妹那么高兴，所以才没对他办理这事的经过加以品评，因为魏斯顿的做 法确实有些轻率孟浪。
第五章
苏菲亚和她姑妈之间的一段经过
姑妈走进房间的时候，苏菲亚正在看书。见到魏斯顿女士进来，她急 忙把书合上，这倒使得这位可敬的女士不禁问起她究竟在看什么书，这么 藏藏躲躲的？苏菲亚回答说："姑姑，请您相信，我既不觉得读这本书是什 么可耻的事，又敢于承认我读过它。这是上流社会的一位小姐写的丝，我认 为她的高明见解足以为我们女性增光，她的仁慈心肠也足以为我们人类增 光。"这时，魏斯顿女士把书拿起来，随后又撂下说："不错，作者的门第 倒是好的，可是不大知名。我从来也不曾读过它，因为最有名望的批评家 说它一无可取。"苏菲亚说："姑姑，我自然不敢去反驳那些最有名望的批 评家，不过，我觉得这里面有很丰富的人情事理。不少地方写得真切细 腻，使我感动得流下了眼泪。"姑妈说："哦，那么你很爱哭吧？”侄女回答 道："我喜欢读充满柔情的场景，也甘愿随时为它而流泪。……”姑妈 说："那么指给我看看刚才我进来的时候你正读的地方。我相信那一段一定 充满了柔情，而且还充满了爱情呢。亲爱的苏菲亚，你脸红啦，哎，孩 子，你应该读读那些教你点作假的本事的书，那样你才能更叫人看不透你 的心思……"苏菲亚回答说："姑姑，我希望自己没有什么可耻的心思怕人 看透。"姑妈大声说："可耻！不，我不认为你有什么使你会感到可耻的心 思，可是，孩子，刚才我一提到'爱情'，你就脸红了。亲爱的苏菲，你放 心，你的一切心思我都十分清楚，就像在咱们的军队行动之前，法国人早 就晓得咱们的部署一样。孩子，难道你以为既然已经瞒过你爹，你就也可 以瞒过我的耳目吗？难道你以为我就不知道昨天你为什么会对布利非先生 那么过分殷勤吗？我多少还见过点世面，这你是瞒不过我的。不，不，别 再脸红了。告诉你，这种情感没什么可耻的。我自己完全赞成，我把你爹 也说得赞成了。说真的，我所关怀的只是你本人的心愿，我总要尽力成全 你，虽然也许因此会不得不牺牲更好的前程。来，我有个好消息告诉你， 你听了一定会打心坎上高兴。把你的心事都告诉我，我会想法叫你心满意 足。"苏菲亚有生以来从没这么莫名其妙过。她说："哎呀，姑姑，我真不 晓得说什么好啦。您为什么往这上头疑心我？"魏斯顿女士说："可别撒 谎。要晓得咱们都是女人，你又是在跟自己的亲姑姑谈话。希望你相信我 对你是友善的。而且你要告诉我的只不过是我早已晓得的事，而且昨天尽
管你伪装得十分巧妙，要是不精通世故的人一定会被你骗过，可是我却看 得清清楚楚。最后，你还要考虑到我是非常赞成这段爱情的……”苏菲亚 说："哎呀，姑姑，您这真是突如其来，我决没料到的。当然，姑姑，我也 并不是瞎子……真的，倘若在一个人身上看到人类所有的美德是一种过失 的话，那么……不过，难道我爹和您跟我的看法不谋而合吗？"姑妈回答 说："告诉你，我们完全赞成，而且你爹已经替你约好，要你今天下午就接 见那位郎君。”苏菲亚脸色苍白起来，大声说："我爹，今天下午！"姑妈 说："是的，孩子，就在今天下午。你还不晓得你爹的急性子！从你那回在 野地里晕倒，我就看出你爱上了这个人：你晕倒的时候我看出来，你刚一 缓醒过来，我又看出来。当天吃晚饭和第二天吃早饭的时候，我都看得出 来一一孩子，你晓得我是饱经世故的！我把这情形告诉了你爹。哦，他一 听说，马上就要去向奥尔华绥提亲。昨天他提了亲，奥尔华绥也同意了 ――他当然高兴得很。所以告诉你，今天下午你可得拿出最动人的丰采 来。”苏菲亚嚷道："今天下午！亲爱的姑姑，您真把我吓糊涂啦！"姑妈 说："啊，亲爱的，过一会儿你就会清醒过来了，因为说实话，他确实是个 讨人喜欢的小伙子。"苏菲亚说："自然，我承认没有人像他那么+全十美 的。那么勇敢，又那么温柔；说话那么俏皮，可又不讨人嫌；那么富于同 情心，那么有礼貌，那么斯文，那么漂亮！跟这些优点比起来，出身低微 又算得了什么！"姑妈问道："出身低微！你这是什么意思？难道布利非先 生出身低微吗？"苏菲亚一听到这个名字，脸上刷地一下没有了血色，她有 气无力地把这名字重复了一遍。看到这般情景，姑妈就大声说："布利非先 生一一对，就是布利非先生。除了他之外，咱们谈的还能是谁呢？”苏菲亚 几乎要昏倒在地，回答说："我的天！我以为是琼斯先生呢。除了他谁也不 配……"姑妈大声嚷道："告诉你，现在是你把我吓坏啦。难道你爱上的是 琼斯先生，而不是布利非先生吗？”苏菲亚又重复一遍说："布利非先生！ 您这一定是在开玩笑。要是您当真这么想的话，那我可是世上最不幸的女 人了。"魏斯顿女士站在那里，一时没出声，气得两眼直冒火。最后，才使 足了嗓门一板一眼地向她咆哮道：
"你真的居然想嫁个私生子来玷辱家门吗？魏斯顿家清白的血统能让你 这么去糟蹋吗？要是你的头脑不够清醒，克制不住这种可怕的念头，我以 为就是凭咱们家的体面，你也不该容许自己产生这么低贱的爱情呀。我更 没料到你竟然会恬不知耻地当面向我承认这件事！”
"姑姑，"苏菲亚战战兢兢地回答说，"刚才是您逼我说出来的呀。我不 记得曾经对任何人称道过琼斯先生。就是刚才，如果不是以为他已经得到 了您的赞许，我也不会那么谈的。不管我心里对那个可怜的、不幸的年轻 人抱着什么看法，我也只是想把那看法带到坟墓里去一一如今我才明白， 只有在那里我才能得到安宁。"说到这里她倒在椅子上，泪如雨下。在撼人 心魂的静寂中，这片无法言状的凄怆景象恐怕铁石心肠的人见了也难免要 感动几分。
可是苏菲亚这般悲伤愁苦却一点也没引起她姑妈的同情。她反而更加 气恼了。"我宁可跟着你进坟墓，"姑妈暴戾地嚷道，"也不愿意看着你结这 门亲事，给你自己和咱们这一家丢脸。啊，我的天，活到今天我万也没料 到会听我侄女向我承认爱上了这么个家伙！你可是头一个一一对，魏斯顿 小姐，你是这门这姓头一个怀着如此卑鄙下流的想法的。人人都晓得咱们 家的妇女多么稳重……"她滔滔不绝地足足说了一刻钟，后来怒气虽未消， 气力却接不上了，这才恫吓一声要马上去把这件事告诉她哥哥，随即把话 打住了。
于是苏菲亚跪到她姑妈跟前，握住她的手，流着泪苦苦哀求她，千万 把被她套出的这段话瞒起来，并竭力说她父亲的性子有多么暴躁，一再表 示不论她有什么心愿，也决不会做出让她父亲生气的事来。
魏斯顿女士站在那儿望了她一会儿，定了定神说，只有在一个条件下 她可以不让她哥哥晓得这个秘密：苏菲亚得答应当天下午接待来求婚的布 利非先生，把他当作未婚夫看待。
可怜的苏菲亚早已抓在她姑妈的手掌中，什么也不能断然拒绝。她只 好答应见布利非先生，并且尽力对他彬彬有礼。不过她央求姑妈，别匆忙 决定这桩亲事，因为布利非先生实在不称她的心意，她还希望能把父亲劝 得改变主张，不要让她成为世上最不幸的女人。
魏斯顿女士告诉她说："亲事早已完全定妥了，那是不能解除，也是不 应该解除的。其实，以前我并没看重这件事，甚至也许还有些犹豫呢；后 来看到你自己很乐意这桩亲事，我才打消犹豫的。不过，如今我认为这门 亲事倒是再合适没有了，只要我能办得到，就决不容有片刻延缓。”
苏菲亚回答说："姑姑，我希望您和我爹发发慈悲，起码也要缓一下再 办。目前我对那个人十分厌恶，两位总得容我点时间来克服一下呀。”
她姑妈回答说，她对人情世故太熟悉了，决不会去上侄女的当。既然 她晓得侄女钟情另外一个人，她只有更加催促魏斯顿先生尽早结了亲。她 还说："如果眼看敌人的援军就要来解围，还不抓紧时机攻城，那就太失策 了。不，不，苏菲，我相信你对那个人十分痴情，可你要是成功，就不能 不丧失体面。我要尽可能不让咱们家为你的体面担心思；等你出嫁以后， 那就由你丈夫操心去吧。孩子，我希望你一举一动总要更稳重些，不要失 掉身份。万一你没能做到，像许多女人一样，结婚总可以把你挽救过来 的。”
苏菲亚完全明白她姑妈话里指的是什么，她觉得最好还是不去理会。 不过，她决定接见布利非先生，并且对他尽量客气，因为只有凭这一诺 言，她的姑妈才答应替她隐瞒起她的心事一一这个心事，与其说是被魏斯 顿女士使计策套出去的，还不如说是由于她的噩运而不幸泄漏出去的。

第六章
苏菲亚和昂诺尔大姐之间的谈话一一也许足以慰藉一下前一章所写 情景在仁厚的读者心中所引起的惆怅
上一章里我们看到魏斯顿女士得到她侄女的诺言之后，就离去了。接 着，昂诺尔大姐走了进来。她正在隔壁房间里干活儿，听到姑妈和侄女谈 话的声音有时候大了起来，就被吸引到钥匙孔跟前，一直偷听着。昂诺尔 进到房里，看见苏菲亚呆呆站在那儿，眼里淌着泪水，自己也就马上挤出 适量的眼泪，然后说："哎唷，亲爱的小姐，怎么回事呀？ ”苏菲亚大声 说："没什么。"昂诺尔说："没什么！亲爱的小姐，可不能这么说。看您多 么难过，刚才您又跟姑太太有过那一番谈话！……"苏菲亚大声说："别拿 我开玩笑，告诉你，什么事也没有。咳，天哪，我为什么要来到人世！"昂 诺尔大姐说："小姐，我无论如何也不能相信您平白无故会这么伤心的。自 然，我只不过是个用人，可是，说真的，我对您一向是忠心耿耿，为了 您，我可以舍掉性命的。"苏菲亚说："亲爱的昂诺尔，这件事你是无能为 力的。我完啦，没有挽救的余地了。"女仆说："怎么可能呢！不过，小 姐，就是我不能替您尽点力，让我知道知道，我心里也可以宽慰一些…… 告诉我吧，亲爱的小姐，究竟是怎么回事。"苏菲亚叫着："我爹要把我嫁 给一个我又厌恶又憎恨的人。"昂诺尔回答说："这个坏人是谁呀？这人一 定很坏，不然的话，小姐不会厌恶他的。"苏菲亚说："一提他的名字我心 里就恶心，不久你就会晓得的。"老实说，昂诺尔早已经知道了，所以关于 这一点她也并不寻根问底。她接着这样说下去："我不敢冒昧给您出什么主 意，我不过是个用人，该怎么应付，小姐当然比我清楚多了。不过，哼， 不论什么样的老子也休想强迫我去嫁个我不要嫁的人。说真的，乡绅心肠 挺好，要是他晓得小姐又厌恶又憎恨这个年轻人，他决不会愿意把您嫁给 他的。要是您答应的话，好不好让我把您这意思禀告老爷？自然，还是小 姐亲自去说更合适些。可是既然小姐嫌这个讨厌的名字会脏了您的 嘴……"苏菲亚说："昂诺尔，你错啦，我爹连想都没想过应该告诉我一声 就决定了。"昂诺尔叫道："那他就更不像话啦。将来跟这个人同床睡觉的 是您，又不是老爷呀。尽管一个男人规规矩矩，可也不见得每个女人都觉 得他漂亮哇。要是没有旁人挑唆的话，我相信老爷一定不会这么办事。有 些人少管点闲事多好！要是搁在自己身上，我相信他们也不会愿意被人这
样摆布。尽管我是女用人，我也相信男人并不都是同样可心可意的。小姐 要是不能嫁给您认为顶漂亮的那位郎君，您名下那么一大笔财产又有什么 意思呢？我不说啦，不过，有些小伙子出身不够高贵，真是可惜一一自 然，出身怎样，我自己倒不大在乎，可是这样一来，名下就没那么多财产 啦。可那又算得了什么！小姐的钱足够两人吃用不尽的。您那份财产能这 么用掉岂不是再好不过了吗？当然人人都得承认，再没有比他长得更英 俊、更可爱、更体面、更高大、更规矩的人了……"苏菲亚带着庄重的脸色 向她嚷道："你对我啰嗦这些是什么意思？我哪天准许你这么随随便便来 着？”昂诺尔回答说："小姐，对不起。可我也没什么恶意。不过，自从今 早遇到那位可怜的少爷，他就一直在我的脑子里打转。说真的，要是刚才 小姐看到他，也一定会可怜他的。哎，少爷真命苦。但愿他没碰上什么倒 霉的事。今天整个早晨，他都抱着胳膊，愁眉不展地踱来踱去。我发誓， 看到他那副样子，我差点儿没哭出来。"苏菲亚说："你看到谁了？"昂诺尔 说："可怜的琼斯先生。”苏菲亚大声说："看到了他？你在哪儿看到 的？”昂诺尔说："在水渠旁边。他在那儿踱了一整个早晨，最后，就躺了 下来一一我相信他现在也还在那儿躺着哪。说真的，要不是因为我是个姑 娘，不好意思，我一定会走过去跟他说说话儿。小姐，您让我瞅瞅去吧！ 为了好奇，瞅瞅他还在不在那儿。"苏菲亚说："别瞎扯啦！不会还在的， 不会的。他在那儿干什么？他准是老早就走掉了。而且，凭什么……干什 么……凭什么你要去瞅瞅呢？而且，我还有事情要你做。去把我的帽子和 手套拿来。饭前我要跟我姑姑到林子里去散散步。"昂诺尔立刻照办了。苏 菲亚戴上帽子，可是对镜一照，觉得帽上的带子不大合适，就又把女仆叫 回来，吩咐她换了一条旁的颜色的帽带。然后再三嘱咐昂诺尔大姐千万别 放下她手边的活计，说她要得很急，当天非做完不可，随即又含含糊糊说 了声到林子里去散步，就迈开颤抖的纤弱的腿，朝着相反的方向，笔直往 水渠那边尽快地赶去。
琼斯确实像昂诺尔大姐所说的，曾经来过那里，他足足呆了两个钟 头，在那里怀念着苏菲亚。不过，他刚从花园的一个门出去，苏菲亚就从 另外一个门进来了。不幸，为了调换帽带多耽搁了几分钟，竟然使这对情 人错过相逢的机会，这真是件极其不幸的事。我相信女读者们一定会从中 吸取十分有益的教训。这里，我严禁一切男性的批评家妄加议论。这段情 节原是只为妇女而叙述的，只有她们才可以随便发表意见。
第七章
按照传统笔法绘出的求婚仪式缩影;另外则是一幅充满柔情蜜意的 写真，勾勒得一笔不苟
有人（也许有许多人）说得好：祸不单行。这个明智的格言当前就为 苏菲亚证实了：她既因为没能见到自己所爱的人而失望，又因为不得不打 扮起来去接见自己所憎恨的那个人而懊恼。
那天下午，魏斯顿先生第一次把他的打算通知了女儿，并且告诉苏菲 亚说，他晓得女儿早就从她姑妈那里听说了。这时，苏菲亚神色忧郁，几 滴晶莹的泪珠不禁夺眶而出。"得啦，得啦，"魏斯顿说，"趁早别那么扭扭 捏捏的，我全晓得啦。你放心，你姑姑全告诉我了。”
“能是这样吗？ ”苏菲亚说，"难道姑姑已经把我的心事泄露出去 了 ? ”魏斯顿说："可不是吗，泄露啦！是昨天你自己在饭桌上泄露出来 的。一眼就看得出你在闹恋爱。可是你们女孩子家永远不晓得自己要些什 么。就因为我打算把你嫁给你所爱上的那个人，你倒哭起来了。我记得你 妈妈当初也是这么哭鼻子来着，可是行完婚礼不出二十四个钟头，就啥事 没有了。布利非先生是个机灵小伙子，他不会让你拘泥多大工夫的。喏， 打起精神来吧，打起精神来，眼看他就要到了。”
这时，苏菲亚才相信她姑姑信守了对她许下的诺言。她立志要隐忍一 切，挨过那个不愉快的下午，并且决不让她父亲看出丝毫马脚。
过一会儿，布利非先生来了。魏斯顿先生很快就退了出来，房里只剩 下这对年轻人。
接着是将近一刻钟的沉默，因为应该先开口的那位先生由于害羞，拘 谨得极不相宜。好几回他想说话，可是话到嘴边又咽回去了。终于一串牵 强附会、华而不实的恭维话从他嘴里滔滔涌出，苏菲亚则眼睛望着地，弯 着腰，嘴里吐出一些彬彬有礼的单字来应对。由于对女人的举止表情毫无 经验，同时又自以为很了不起，所以布利非把苏菲亚这种态度当作对求婚 的默许了。当苏菲亚为了结束这难以忍受下去的一幕而站起来走出房间的 时候，他也认为这只不过是出于腼腆，并且自己安慰着自己：不久就有的 是亲近的日子了。
他对自己成功的前景，确实已十分满意一一至于他是否像情种们所要 求的，全部并且绝对占有了对方的心，他却根本没想到过这一点。他所渴
望的只不过是她的财产和她的身子，他毫不怀疑这些很快就会完全归他所 有，因为魏斯顿先生很急于结这门亲事，而他十分清楚苏菲亚一向对父亲 的意旨是严格服从的，而且在必要的情况下，她父亲要是下了更严厉的命 令她也会屈服的。布利非心里估量着：既有这父亲的威严作后盾，再加上 他自己的丰采和谈吐，料想那小姐（他相信苏菲亚心上并无旁人）决无不 应之理。
对于琼斯，他的确连一点点妒忌之意也没有一一作者对这一点经常感 到诧异。也许他认为琼斯在那一带是以全国最浪荡的家伙之一出了名的 （这一点公不公道，请读者自去判断），在苏菲亚那样端庄不过的小姐眼 里，一定是可憎的。也许还因为他们三人在一起时，苏菲亚以及琼斯本人 的举止从不曾使他怀疑什么。最后一一并且也是最主要的一点，他确信除 他之外再没有旁人在追求苏菲亚。布利非自认为彻底了解琼斯，十分看不 起其判断力，因为琼斯总是不够重视自己的利益。他毫不担心琼斯会爱上 苏菲亚；至于小姐的财产，他认为是不大能左右琼斯那样一个傻小子的意 向的。况且他以为琼斯跟毛丽•西格里姆的关系一直没断，甚至相信两人到 头来必然会结婚的一一琼斯从小着实和布利非要好，什么事也不瞒他；直 到看见奥尔华绥先生卧病时布利非对待老人家的态度，琼斯才完全和他疏 远了。正因为那次吵架以后两人一直也没和解，所以布利非先生对琼斯跟 毛丽的关系所发生的变化，丝毫也不知情。
由于上述种种原因，布利非先生看不出有什么可以阻挠他和苏菲亚之 间的婚事获得成功。他断定她的态度和所有的闺秀初次接见求婚人时并无 两样，一切都如他所期望的。
魏斯顿先生早埋伏着等待求婚人从小姐那里退出。看到布利非为此番 的成功如此兴高采烈，对他的女儿是如此一往情深，对接见的情况又是如 此心满意足，这位老乡绅竟然在大厅里手舞足蹈起来，并且还用其他滑稽 的动作来表示他的狂喜。他完全不会克制喜怒哀乐之情，只要一阵心血来 潮，他立刻就若醉若狂，毫无节制。
布利非在受到魏斯顿的一通热烈亲吻和拥抱之后，告辞而去。善良的 乡绅立刻到处找他的女儿，找到后马上滔滔不绝地诉说他心里有多么欢 喜，吩咐她说，一切衣服珠宝随她挑选，并且声言他这份财产除了供她享 用之外，别无用途。然后他又无限爱抚地一遍又一遍地拥抱她，用种种亲 昵的名字叫她，郑重声称她是他的掌上明珠。
苏菲亚虽然觉得她父亲这阵爱抚有些莫名其妙（这种一阵阵的温情突 发在他本是常事，不过这回来得格外剧烈），却又认为现在是向父亲表明 心迹的最好时机，起码该把她对布利非先生的态度解释清楚；她充分预见 到，很快就不得不把事情和盘托出。于是，她先感谢父亲对她所表示的疼 爱，随后又带着无限的温柔说："爹真的会那么好，把女儿苏菲的幸福看作 您生平唯一的乐事吗？”魏斯顿重重地赌了个咒，又吻了她一下，表示确是 这样。这时，苏菲亚就抓住他的手，跪在地上，先热烈地表示了一番自己 对父亲的孝心和顺从，然后就哀求乡绅千万别硬逼着她去嫁给一个她所憎 恨的人，使她成为世上最不幸的女子。她说："亲爱的爹，我要求这一点， 是为了我自己，也为了您好一一既然您告诉我说，您的幸福就取决于我的 幸福。……"魏斯顿狂怒地瞪着她说："什么？怎么？"她接着说："不但可 怜的苏菲终身幸福不幸福，连她的生死也全看您答不答应她这个请求了。 我不能和布利非先生一起过日子。强迫我接受这件亲事就等于杀掉我。 ……"魏斯顿说："你不能和布利非先生在一起过日子？ ”苏菲亚回答 说："不能，实在不能。"魏斯顿一把搡开她，大声嚷道："混账！那么你就 死去吧！"苏菲亚抓住他的衣裾哀求说："爹，求您可怜可怜我吧。别这么 瞪我，说这么凶狠的话……您的苏菲苦到这个地步，难道您一点也不动心 吗？您是天下最慈祥的爹，难道会叫我心碎吗？难道您忍心用这种最痛 苦、最残忍的折磨来伤我的性命吗？"乡绅嚷道："呸！呸！瞎扯！全是些 丫头们的鬼把戏。说得倒好：伤你的性命！结婚会伤你的性命吗？”苏菲亚 回答说："啊，爹，这样的婚姻比死还不如。我不但对这个人不感兴趣，我 还恨他，厌恶他。"魏斯顿大声说："就是你对他厌恶透顶，你也非得嫁给 他不可。"为了表示他说一不二，他还起了个誓一一那话实在不堪入耳，这 里只好从略。他恶狠狠地赌了许多咒，最后这么说："反正我已经拿定主意 要结这门亲。你要是不答应，我就一个铜板也不给你。就是看到你在街上 饿得快要死掉，我也不会给你一口面包，把你救活。我已经决计这么办 了，决不改变，你好生想想吧。"说完这话就那么猛力地把她甩开，使她的 脸撞在地板上。乡绅自己则径直离开房间，听任可怜的苏菲亚趴在地上。
魏斯顿走到大厅，正遇上琼斯。琼斯望见他这位朋友神态狂乱，脸色 苍白，气喘吁吁，就不禁问起这副惨相的缘由。乡绅马上原原本本地说给 他听了，最后还痛骂了苏菲亚一顿，并且无限伤心地慨叹着，天下做爹的 养了女儿有多么倒霉。
这以前，琼斯对乡绅已经属意布利非这件事，一直毫无所闻；因此， 乍一听魏斯顿这么说，就如晴天霹雳一般。等琼斯心神镇定了一些之后， 就向魏斯顿先生提出一件事一一这事似乎需要特厚的脸皮才好意思开口； 琼斯后来说，他那样做也是出于万不得已。他要求魏斯顿让他去见见苏菲 亚，说也许能劝得她回心转意，顺从她爹的意旨。
乡绅向来是出名的马虎，即使他有那么精明的话，当前在激情之下， 也很容易上当。他感谢琼斯这么肯替他效劳，就说："去吧，去吧，尽力把 她劝过来。"然后又赌了许多可怕的咒，说要是她不答应这门亲事的话，就 非把她逐出大门不可。
第八章
琼斯和苏菲亚相会
琼斯马上去找苏菲亚，看到父亲把她丢下后，她刚从地上爬起来，眼 里淌着泪，嘴边鲜血直流。他立刻扑上前去，用充满温存与恐怖的声调问 她："啊，我的苏菲亚，您怎么弄成这样吓人的样子？"她怀着深情望了他 片刻，然后说："琼斯先生，您怎么到这儿来啦？我求您马上离开吧。"琼 斯说："可别忍心对我下那样的命令一一我的心流的血可比您那嘴唇流的还 要多。啊，苏菲亚，只要能保存下一滴您那宝贵的血，我多么愿意把我血 管里的血全流净呀。"她说："您已经为我几次不辞艰险，您肯定是出于好 意。"说到这里，她满怀柔情地足足凝视了他一分钟，然后忍不住悲痛地嚷 道："啊，琼斯先生，当初您何必救我！我要是死了，咱们两人都会幸福多 了。"他嚷道："咱们两人都会幸福多了 ！就是零刀碎剐或者五马分尸给我 的痛苦也比不上苏菲亚的……我连这个可怕的字眼都受不了。除了您，我 还为谁而活呢？ ”说这话的时候，他的声调和神色都充满了不可言喻的柔 情，同时还轻轻地握住她的手，她也不曾缩回去。老实说，她简直不晓得 自己在做什么或者有些什么痛苦了。这对恋人沉默地度过了几分钟，这中 间，琼斯热切地凝视着她，苏菲亚则两眼望着地。最后，当苏菲亚的气力 稍稍恢复过来一些的时候，她又要求琼斯走开，不然的话，要是家里发现 他们俩在一起，她非毁掉不可。她还说："啊，琼斯先生，您还蒙在鼓里， 不晓得今天下午发生了一件多么可怕的事……"琼斯说："我全晓得了，我 的苏菲亚。您那狠心的父亲把一切都告诉我啦，而且是他亲自派我来看您 的……"她说："我爹会派您到这儿来？您真是在做梦哩。"琼斯说："但愿 这只是个梦啊，苏菲亚，您父亲派我来是叫我替那个可恶的对手说好话， 替他在您跟前求情。只要能看到您，不管用什么方法我都不在乎。啊，对 我说说呀，苏菲亚，安慰一下我这颗淌着血的心。世上再没有像我这么痴 情地爱着的人了。千万别忍心抽回您这只可爱、细嫩、温柔的手吧一一也 许转眼工夫他们就会把您永远从我身边夺去一一我相信，只有这一桩可怕 的事才使我克服了您在我心里引起的尊重和敬畏之感。"她默默地站了一会 儿，心乱如麻，然后抬起头来，用温柔的目光朝他望着，大声说道："琼斯 先生要我说什么呢？"他嚷道："啊，您只要答应我，无论如何也不嫁给布 利非。”她回答说："再也别提那个讨厌的名字。请放心，只要我力所能
及，他休想从我这儿得到任何东西。"琼斯又大声说："既然您这么好心， 那么如今就请您更进一步，给我一点希望吧……"苏菲亚说："哎，琼斯先 生，您要把我往哪里逼呀？我有什么让您可希望的呢？我爹的心意您是晓 得的……”他回答说："可是我也晓得他却不能强迫您去顺从他的心意 啊！"苏菲亚说："要是违背了他的心意，将会有怎样可怕的后果呀！我自 己的毁灭倒还在其次，一想到由于我而使得我爹痛苦，我就不忍心。"琼斯 嚷道："他在您身上这么滥用造物主并没赋予他的权利，是自找痛苦。请设 想一下，倘若我失掉了您会多么痛苦，看看您究竟更可怜谁……"她回答 说："设想一下！如果我顺从您的愿望，您就会因而遭到不幸。难道您以为 我不在意吗？正是由于想到这一点我才下定决心，要求您永远离开我，免 得造成您自己的毁灭……"琼斯大声说："我不怕什么毁灭，怕的只是丢掉 苏菲亚。您要是想使我脱离痛苦的深渊，那么就请您收回那个残酷的判决 吧。说实在的，我永远也不能离开您，实在不能。”
这对恋人默默地伫立在那里，颤抖着。苏菲亚没有力气抽回她的手， 琼斯也几乎没有力气抓住它。这一幕我相信有些读者会感到够长了，这时 突然插进一个性质大不相同的场面，我们留待下一章再讲吧。
第九章
本章远比上一章紧张激烈
在我们往下叙述这对恋人的遭遇之前，也许应该先把他们相怜相爱地 会晤时大厅里所发生的事，向读者交代一下。
琼斯刚一离开魏斯顿先生去看苏菲亚（像前边所提过的），乡绅的妹 妹就走了进来。乡绅马上把他为着布利非和苏菲亚所引起的争吵一五一十 地告诉了她。
魏斯顿女士认为侄女这一举绝对违背了当初她答应替苏菲亚保守关于 她爱琼斯先生这个秘密的交换条件。因此，她觉得自己完全有权利把所晓 得的底细一古脑儿泄露给乡绅。于是，就立刻撇开闲言絮语，毫不含糊地 通盘告诉了她哥哥。
乡绅脑子里从来也没闪现过琼斯会跟他女儿结婚这个念头，不论是在 他跟那个青年顶要好的时刻，还是由于什么迹象引起他的疑惑，或是出于 任何其他原因。他确实认为，两家财产地位相当，正像双方必须是一男一 女，以及其他重要事项一样，乃是联姻必不可少的条件。因此，他从不担 心女儿会爱上个穷光蛋，一如他从不担心她会爱上人类之外的什么动物。
所以听了他妹妹的叙述，真如晴天霹雳一般。开头，他惊愕得几乎接 不上气，一句话也说不出。可是过一会儿他缓过勤来，气势更猛，火力更 冲了。任何事物经过一段间歇后，通常都是如此。
他镇定下来，恢复了说话的能力之后，首先就排炮般地咒骂了一通， 然后赶忙朝着苏菲亚的房间走去，估计准会抓到这对恋人；每走一步还喃 喃自语一一或者不如说是叫嚷着非报仇不可。
当一对鸽子或是斑鸠一一或者说，当斯特莱封和斐丽丝丝（这个比喻更 近似些）隐身在幽静的丛林里喁喁情话一一斯特莱封那个害臊的少年在大 庭广众之中是一句话也说不出的，只有单独和情人在一起的时候他才是个 好伴侣；就在这万籁俱寂的当儿，云层间蓦地响起雷声，满天隆隆疾走。 姑娘马上从覆满苔薛的河岸或是绿草如茵的高坡上惊起，原先为着爱情而 绯红了的双颊，这时顿然变成死一般苍白。恐怖使得她通身颤抖，那位情 郎几乎扶不住她那摇摇欲坠、战栗着的身子了。
或者说在索尔兹伯里的某家客栈或酒馆里，当两个丝毫不晓得城里有 位奇士的先生们正在畅饮的时候，忽然伟大的道迪省（他扮起疯子来跟那些
唆使他的人扮演傻子同样惟妙惟肖）哗啷啷地抖动着铁链，沿着走廊发出 凄惨恐怖的号叫声，把两个陌生的过路人吓得目瞪口呆。声音越来越逼 近，他们赶紧寻觅藏身之所一一倘若从那牢牢钉着栅栏的窗户可以遁去的 话，他们一定也会拼着摔死的危险来避开这迫在眉睫的威胁的。
可怜的苏菲亚听到她父亲令人毛骨悚然的声音，就像上面那种情景一 样全身颤抖，面无人色。魏斯顿一路叫骂着，赌咒非干掉琼斯不可。其 实，琼斯自己由于对苏菲亚的钟情，在这恐怖之下只顾得去想如何分担姑 娘的苦难，来不及考虑到自身的安全；不然的话，为了妥当起见，我看他 —定也宁愿另找个安全角落的。
这时，乡绅撞开了门，可是映入眼帘的景象使他对琼斯的一腔怒火顿 然熄灭下来，这就是苏菲亚脸色惨白地晕倒在她情人怀里。魏斯顿一看到 这悲惨光景，全部怒气都消失了。他大声吼叫着呼救，先扑向他的女儿， 接着又奔到门口喊人拿水来，后来又跑回苏菲亚身边，一直也没理会到她 是倚在谁的怀里，甚至也许根本不曾想到世间还有个琼斯。我相信，此刻 他头脑里确实只有女儿晕倒这一件事。
不久，魏斯顿女士和家里许多仆人也都拿着水、药酒以及其他救急的 用品赶来救苏菲亚。这些东西非常有效，两三分钟后苏菲亚就开始苏醒， 一切生机逐渐恢复过来。于是，她的女仆和魏斯顿女士就把她搀回她的房 间。临走时，那位善良的女士少不得给了她哥哥一些有益的劝告，指出他 这种暴躁脾气（或者按照她的说法一一疯勤儿）会造成多么可怕的后果。
乡绅也许并没了解她这番劝告，因为她是用旁敲侧击、耸耸肩膀以至 赞赏的语调表示的；即使他懂了，也没从中得到很大教益，因为他刚一消 除当前对女儿性命的忧虑，马上就又像刚才那样暴跳如雷起来。要不是身 强力壮的撒波尔牧师在场，硬凭力气拦住了他，乡绅准会跟琼斯动起武 来。
苏菲亚一离开，琼斯就带着哀求的神情走向牧师用双臂抱住的魏斯顿 先生，恳请他镇定下来，因为如果他继续这么发脾气，琼斯就没法对他把 话讲明白。
"我要叫你永远放明白点儿，"乡绅回答说，"你脱衣服吧。你不算个 人，我要你好好吃我一顿揍。"随后，他对那个青年破口大骂，用的全是乡 下绅士彼此意见不合的时候用的字眼。他一再要琼斯向他身体的那个部分 鞠躬一一也就是英国下等绅士在斗鸡、赛马或其他公共场合吵嘴时常提到
的那个部分，人们也经常拿这方面的隐喻来打诨逗乐。我相信一般人必然 误会了这段话俏皮在哪儿。实际上，它之所以俏皮，正在于你刚刚威胁过 要踢对方的屁一，接着又要求对方吻你的屁一；我仔细观察过，没有人希 望你踢他的那个部分，或提出要吻别人的那个部分。
同样奇怪的是，凡是跟乡间绅士交谈过的人，这种殷勤的邀请一定都 听过几千遍，可是我敢说谁也没见人照样履行过一一这真是乡下人缺乏礼 貌的绝好证据，因为在都市里这极为平常，上流绅士们成天都对地位比他 们显贵的人行这种礼，并且从来也不需要邀请。
对于乡绅这一切俏皮话，琼斯心平气和地回答说："先生，您对我的这 种无礼也许已经抵消了我以往欠您的许多恩情，可是有一点那是永远也抵 消不了的：不管怎样辱骂我，也不能叫我举起手来打苏菲亚的父亲。”
乡绅听了这番话，更加发火了，牧师只好劝琼斯走开。他说："看哪， 先生，您在这里只有叫他越来越生气，所以我求您别再呆下去了。他既然 跟您生这么大气，眼前话是讲不下去的。还不如先告辞，有什么想解释 的，日后有机会再说。”
琼斯道了谢，接受了这个劝告，马上就走了。这时，牧师松开了手， 乡绅重获自由，脾气也缓和下来；甚至说亏得牧师把他拉住，不然的话， 他会把琼斯的脑浆都打出来的。还说："要是为这个流氓给送上绞刑架，那 可倒霉透顶了。”
牧师对调停成功十分得意，随后就发表了一篇戒怒的演说，性情急躁 的人听了，不但不会消除怒气，反而会激起更大的怒气。他还用许多古人 的名言来丰富他的讲演，尤其引用了塞涅卡四的话一一这位古代学者笔下把 愤怒这种情感处理得十分妙，只要不是在气头上，读了他的文章没有不获 得极大的愉快和教益的。这位神学家用亚历山大和克里特斯的著名轶事［绍来 结束他这篇演说一一不过我发现它已经以"醉酒”为题，记入我的备忘录里 了，这里就从略。
乡绅没去理会这段轶事，他甚至什么也没听见，因为牧师还没讲完他 就予以打断，并吩咐端上一大杯啤酒来，说发脾气令人口渴一一对于这种 精神上的热症，这见解是再正确不过的。
乡绅刚咽下一大口酒，就又谈起琼斯来，说他明天一早就去找奥尔华 绥先生，让他晓得这件事。牧师出于一片好心，劝他不必这样。可是这番 劝告只不过惹起乡绅一连串咒骂，虔诚的撒波尔听了大为吃惊。不过他没
敢再去责备。乡绅认为咒骂是他作为一个自由英国人的特权。说句老实 话，既然这位牧师要借乡绅的餐桌来享享口福，那么就免不得不时地委屈 一下他的耳朵。想到他向来也不曾助长乡绅去犯这种罪过，而纵使他从来 也没踏进过魏斯顿的大门，乡绅的野话也不会少说上一句，自己也就心安 理得了。尽管牧师没有冒昧在做客的时候去指责主人，然而他却在讲坛上 间接地对乡绅有所进言。固然，这样做并没使乡绅本人改弦易辙，可是在 他的良心上也起到这样的作用：魏斯顿对旁人说野话一律加以严办，结果 全教区可以任意咒骂而不受惩罚的只剩他保安官一个人了。
第十章
魏斯顿先生走访奥尔华绥先生
奥尔华绥先生刚和他的外甥用过早餐，听这位年轻绅士叙述他会见苏 菲亚的成功，感到十分快慰。奥尔华绥先生很希望能结成这门亲事，他着 眼的主要是小姐的品格，而不是她的家当。这当儿，魏斯顿先生猛地闯了 进来，什么客套也不讲，开口就是：
"哼，都是你干的好事。这个野杂种你可没白养！我倒并不认为你也掺 在里头一一就是说，成心搞出来的，可是我们家却给弄得乱七八糟……"奥 尔华绥说："魏斯顿先生，出了什么事啦？"魏斯顿回答说："真是妙不可言 的事儿。我家的闺女爱上你家那个野种了，就是这么回事。可是我连半个 铜板也不给她，连钱渣子也叫她摸不着。我常想，把个野种当作上等人那 么抚养起来，随他出入亲友家内，究竟有什么好处？我抓不到他，就算他 运气；要是抓到的话，就非揍他一顿不可。我要揍得他再也不敢追婆娘， 叫这个婊子养的再也不敢把他的狗脸伸到老爷的好饭好菜上来。他休想再 吃着我一口饭菜，也休想得到我的一个小钱。她要是跟了这个野种，那么 她穿的那件衬衣也就是她的全部嫁妆。我宁可把我的财产全捐作减债基金 当，把它送到汉诺威派丝手中去腐化我们的国家。"奥尔华绥大声说："实在 抱歉。"魏斯顿说："抱什么鬼歉！我可造化不小！眼睁睁地就这么丢掉了 我的独生女，我的可怜的苏菲。她本是我的心肝儿，是我老年的一切寄托 和安慰。可是我非把她赶出去不可，让她去讨饭，挨饿，烂在街头。她别 想得到我半个铜板。那个婊子养的一向很会找伏窝的野兔，该死的东西！ 我却没想到他追的是这只小兔。可这是他一辈子找到的最倒霉的一个。他 只能捞到一具腐尸。你告诉这小子，除了一个臭皮囊，他什么也别想捞 到。"奥尔华绥大声说："事情真叫我吃惊，昨天我的外甥还刚刚向令媛求 婚的呀。"魏斯顿说："对呀，先生，正是在你外甥向她求过婚以后，全部 事实才摊出来。布利非少爷刚一走，那个婊子养的就溜了进来。我一直喜 欢他，把他当作一个好猎人，没料到他却一直在偷偷猎取我的女儿……"奥 尔华绥说："说实在的，您要是没给他那么多机会来接近令媛就好了。平心 而论，您总会承认我一向都不赞成他在府上勾留那么久的，尽管我也决没 怀疑到他会有这种行为。"魏斯顿叫嚷道："妈的，谁又料得到呢？苏菲跟 他有什么交道可打？他是来同我打猎的，不是来跟她吊膀子的。"奥尔华绥
说："不过您常常看到他们俩在一起，难道您能一点儿也没看出他们相爱的 痕迹来吗？”魏斯顿大声说："天理良心，这我可从来也没看出。我甚至从 来也没见过他亲苏菲一下。他不但没向她献过殷勤，当着苏菲的面他反而 比平常话更少了。至于我那个姑娘，她对其他任何上门的年轻人都要比对 他客气些。关于那类事儿，我也不比旁人更容易受骗的。老街坊，你可别 以为我那么容易上当。"奥尔华绥几乎要笑出来，可是他竭力忍住，因为他 十分通达人情，颇有教养，为人心地又善良，决不会在这种场合去得罪乡 绅。于是他问魏斯顿当前有什么吩咐。乡绅要他管住琼斯，让他离乡绅的 大门远远的，并说他自己回去就要把那贱人锁起来一一不论姑娘怎样拼命 反对，也非要她嫁给布利非少爷不可。说完这话，他还跟布利非握了握 手，说他决不收旁人作女婿，然后就匆匆辞去，说家里乱得一团糟，不能 不赶快回去，别让他女儿溜掉了。至于琼斯，他发誓要是在他家里抓到 他，就把他收拾得够资格去参加阉马的比赛。
屋里只剩下奥尔华绥和布利非二人了，他们沉默了好半天。这时，那 位少爷不断叹着气，一部分是出于失望，但更多的是出于仇恨一一琼斯取 得的成功比他自己失掉苏菲亚要使他痛心得多。
最后，他舅父问他作何打算，布利非是这样回答的："哎，舅舅，当理 智和情感朝着相反的方向指示的时候，一个情人何去何从还成什么问题 吗？不用说，在两者之间他总会受情感驱使的。理智告诉我：对于一个心 已另有所属的女人，应当不再存任何想头，可是情感吩咐我不可绝望，过 一阵子她作兴会回心转意，喜欢上我的。不过，我认为还可以提出一个相 反的论点，如果不把它充分驳倒，事情就不好往下进行了。我指的是：既 然姑娘的心早已为另一个男人占据了，如今硬夺人之所爱是有失公道的。 不过，从魏斯顿先生坚定不移的意思看来，我要是这么做，倒可以成全了 大家：不但可以把做父亲的从痛苦的深渊里拯救出来，也免得小姐和琼斯 由于这场婚姻而同归于尽。从各方面来说，我都不怀疑魏斯顿小姐将要断 送一切：她不但要丧失大部分财产，并且还得嫁给一个叫花子，这样一 来，她父亲必须分给她的那点点财产也将要被琼斯挥霍在那个娼妇身上， 因为我晓得他们至今还在勾勾搭搭。这还是小事。琼斯是世上最坏的家伙 之一，我一直竭力替他隐瞒着。亲爱的舅舅，您要是知道了他那些勾当， 您早就抛弃这个不可救药的浪荡子啦。"奥尔华绥说："怎么，除了我已经 晓得的，他还干过什么更坏的事吗？告诉我，一定得告诉我！ ”布利非
说："事情已经过去啦，说不定他已经悔过了呢，不必去提它啦。"奥尔华 绥说："我命令你，你有义务，一定得告诉我你指的是什么。”布利非 说："舅舅，我从来也没违背过您的意旨，这您是晓得的。不过我悔不该提 起这件事，因为这么一来，我倒有些像乘机报复；其实，谢天谢地，我从 没有过这种心思。如果您一定要我说出来，那么我就得替他求情，求您宽 恕他。"奥尔华绥回答说："我不能预先答应什么条件。我想我对他已经仁 至义尽了，也许你们还会觉得我做过了头。"布利非大声说："确实如此， 恐怕已经远远超出他所配得到的，因为就在您的病势最危急的那天，当我 自己和全家都伤心流泪的时候，他却在家里浪荡逍遥，胡作非为。他喝 酒，唱歌，大嚷大叫，我只不过稍微暗示一下那么做不大合体统，他就大 发起脾气来，骂不绝口，叫我流氓，并且还打了我。"奥尔华绥嚷道："怎 么，他还敢打你？”布利非大声说："当然，这一层我倒是早已原谅他了。 不过，他对您这位大恩人的忘恩负义，我却没那么容易忘怀。尽管如此， 我还是希望您宽恕他，想必他是给魔鬼附了体。因为就在当晚，我和屠瓦 孔先生到野外吸吸新鲜空气，为您的病情有转机而欢欣鼓舞的时候，不幸 撞见他和那个烂女人在干着不堪入目的勾当。屠瓦孔先生未免不够稳健， 十分勇敢地走上前去斥责他，但是琼斯（说来令人难过）竟然把这位可敬 的老师痛打一顿，身上的伤到如今也未必好了呢。我由于想尽力保护老 师，自然也吃到他的苦头一一不过，这我早已原谅他了。我还劝屠瓦孔先 生也不必和他计较，并且替他把这件事隐瞒起来，生怕您一晓得，他就不 得了。可是如今既然我一时说走了嘴，您又非要我源源本本都抖出来不 可，那么请容我替他求求情吧。"奥尔华绥说："哎，孩子，你把这件恶行 暂时隐瞒下来，我真不晓得该责备你还是该称赞你为人的善良。可是，屠 瓦孔先生在哪儿呢？倒不是你的话需要证实，我已经拿定主意，要严办这 个恶棍；把跟这件事有关的人证全调查清楚了，这样，大家就会明白为什 么非惩戒不可。”
这时，就派人去请屠瓦孔先生，塾师马上来到，证实了布利非所说的 全部情节，而且还把琼斯先生亲手在他胸脯上清清楚楚留下的青一块紫一 块的"笔迹"袒露出来。最后，他对奥尔华绥先生说，这件事倘若不是布利 非少爷恳切劝阻，他早就来告诉了。他说："布利非少爷是个再好不过的青 年，虽然这么宽恕自己的仇敌未免做得过了分。”
实际上，布利非确乎好不容易才劝住牧师不要立时就去告诉奥尔华 绥，这样做，他是颇有些道理的。他晓得人在病中心肠总是软的，没有平 时严峻。此外，他想要是事情刚刚发生就去告发，而大夫又还没走（他很 可能说出实情），那就无论如何也不能照他所策划的那样来诋毁琼斯。他 把这笔账先悬起来，静等粗心大意的琼斯再闹出什么旁的乱子，因为他估 计大大小小许多案子一古脑儿朝琼斯压下来，就更能搞得他一败涂地。因 此布利非窥伺着，而今命运女神好心好意地把这样一个机会送上门来了。 最后一点，他所以劝屠瓦孔姑且隐瞒一下，是为了证实一下他对琼斯的友 谊一一他曾煞费苦心地在奥尔华绥先生心目中树立这个想法。
第十一章
短短的一章，但其中的情节尽够引起好心读者的同情
奥尔华绥先生向来不在气头上责罚什么人，或者甚至辞退一个仆人。 因此他决定挨到下午再对琼斯宣判。
这个可怜的年轻人像往常一样去用饭，但是他心情沉重，咽不下去。 奥尔华绥先生那副冷冰冰的面孔更加使他难过。他断定必是魏斯顿把他和 苏菲亚的事情统统告诉了奥尔华绥先生。但是布利非先生所讲的事，他却 一点也没料到，因为其中绝大部分他完全是无辜的；其余的部分，因为自 己已予以宽恕，并且忘却了，所以就没想到对方还牢牢记在心头。吃完 饭，等仆人都退下去之后，奥尔华绥先生大声讲起话来。他先数落一番琼 斯所犯的种种罪过，特别是当天揭露出来的那些。最后对琼斯说：除非他 能证明自己清白无罪，不然的话，就一定把他赶走，永不再见他一面。
可怜琼斯想要申辩，但他的处境从许多方面讲都很不利。老实说，他 甚至摸不清自己究竟犯了什么罪，因为奥尔华绥先生在叙述他卧病期间琼 斯酗酒等等的时候，由于不好意思，故意把牵涉到他自己的那部分略去， 而那恰恰是构成琼斯罪过的主要情节一一而酗酒这一点琼斯是无从否认 的。同时，他肠断心碎，精神沮丧到了极点，已经没有气力去为自己辩白 了。一切罪过他都承担下来，只像个绝望的囚犯那样求对方发发慈悲。最 后说，尽管他不得不招认干了许多愚蠢荒唐的事，可是逐出家内对他说来 就是世上最严厉的惩罚，他自问并没犯下这么重的罪过。
奥尔华绥回答说，过去总是念琼斯年幼无知，希望他改过自新，所以 屡次宽恕了他。如今，他已经看出琼斯是个不可救药的流氓，倘若再把他 抚养、纵容下去，那就是罪过了。他接着说道："如今，你目无法纪，居然 想诱拐人家的小姐，我为了保全自己的声名，只好惩戒你。人们早就责备 我不该对你那么照顾，如果不罚你，他们就会认为（而且也不是毫无道 理）我默许了你这种下流无耻的行为一一你一定晓得我对它是多么深恶痛 绝的。如果你稍稍想到我的安宁、名誉以及我对你的情谊，也丝毫不该存 这种念头。可耻啊，小伙子。我简直找不到和你的罪过相称的处罚。我马 上就要赠给你点东西，其实，我自己也不认为有什么理由这样做。不过， 既然我已经把你当作我自己的孩子抚养大了，我不能把你光着身子赶出大 门。所以你打开这个纸包的时候，会发现里面有点东西一一只要你为人勤
恳，它总可以帮助你正正经经谋个生计。但是如果你不用作正途，那么我 也不认为自己还有义务接济你什么了。因为我已经决定从今天起，跟你一 刀两断。我还不得不告诉你，在你的行为中最令我愤恨的，是你欺凌了那 个好心肠的青年（指的是布利非），而他对你是那样仁厚，那样讲道义。” 最后一段话就像一剂苦不堪言的药，实在令人难以下咽。一腔热泪从 琼斯的眼眶里滔滔涌出，他说不出话来，也动弹不得。奥尔华绥斩钉截铁 地吩咐他走，过了好一阵子琼斯才勉强从命，带着一种既假装不来，又描 绘不出的情感吻了吻他的手，然后离去了。
读者诸君倘若以奥尔华绥先生的眼光来看待琼斯，而仍然认为判得过 于苛刻，那就未免心肠太软了。可是左邻右舍，不是出于心肠软就是出于 更加要不得的动机，一致把这种严厉惩罚斥为无比残酷。正是那些以前为 了乡绅对这个私生子（一般都认为是奥尔华绥自己所出）的仁慈而责备他 的人，这时对他把自己的孩子逐出家门又大嚷大叫起来。女人们尤其一致 站在琼斯一边，她们环绕这件事所传出的流言蜚语，决不是这一章能写得 完的。
有一点不应略而不提，那就是：在他们对奥尔华绥的指摘中，谁也没 提到他赠给琼斯的那个纸包里有多少钱一一那有五百镑之多。他们异口同 声地说琼斯被他的灭绝人性的父亲赶走的时候，身上一文不名，有的甚至 说他是光着身子走出去的。
第十二章
情书及其他
琼斯接到必须马上离开的命令，说他的一切衣物可以送到他指定的任 何地点。
于是，他就上路了，走了一哩多地也还没思忖一下，甚至不晓得自己 是往哪里走。后来，一道小溪挡住了他的去路，他就倒在溪畔，不禁带些 愤慨自言自语道："这里休息一下，我的父亲总不会不答应吧。”
琼斯这时陷于极度痛苦中。他揪着自己的头发，通常伴随着疯癫、激 怒和绝望而来的其他举动，也大都出现了。
这样发泄了一阵情感之后，他才慢慢清醒了些。这时，他的忧伤转了 方向，表现得也比刚才温和多了。他终于冷静下来，凭理智来考虑起在这 种凄惨的处境中，该采取些什么样的步骤。
最使他进退维谷的是同苏菲亚的关系。一想到和她分手，几乎使他心 碎肠断；可是一想到毁了苏菲亚的终身，害她要去过乞讨的日子就更加感 到痛苦。虽然由于渴望得到她，他也曾让后一种想法在自己脑子里停留片 刻，可是他捉摸不定她肯不肯付出这么高的代价来满足他的愿望。想到这 样做会激怒奥尔华绥先生，搅得他老人家不得安宁，也有力地制止他去采 取后一个步骤。最后，即使这一切他都在所不惜，也显然无法达到目的 ――这个考虑也大大促使他放弃这一步骤。于是道义加上绝望，兼以对恩 人的感激之情，对意中人的满腔热爱，这千思万虑终于占了上风，压倒了 他那炽烈的欲望，他决计宁可放弃苏菲亚，也不能断送她的终身。
不曾有过这种感觉的人很难体会出，琼斯刚刚以理智战胜情感时他胸 膛里的那种兴奋。也许有一种自豪感使得他颇为得意，因而感到心神为之 一爽。然而这只是一刹那而已。转瞬之间苏菲亚又在他心头出现，胜利所 带给他的快慰就为深切的悲痛所冲淡，他的痛苦决不下于一位仁慈为怀的 将军环视着为他赢得荣誉的成堆尸体，因为对苏菲亚的多少情思都粉碎 了，躺在这位胜利者脚前。
不过，既然决计追随伟大的荣誉的道路（用李如大诗人的说法），他决 心给苏菲亚写一封诀别书。于是，他就走到附近一个人家，讨来纸笔，写 了下面这封信：
小姐：
倘若您设想一下我提笔写此信时的情景，以您的仁厚心肠，一定会原谅信中任何矛盾或 荒谬之处，因为信中一字一句都是发自肺腑，其情意的深挚决不是语言所能表达的。
小姐，我已经决意听从您的吩咐，远走高飞，从此再也看不到您的倩影。您这一吩咐虽 是无比残酷，却也是命运所致，决不是出自我的苏菲亚。命运使事情不得不如此一一为了保全 您，您必须忘却世上有我这个不幸的人存在过。
请相信，如果您有可能听不到我的种种苦难，我是不会向您陈述的。我深知您的心肠是 多么仁慈、善良，对不幸者向来充满了同情，我何能再给您增加痛苦。啊，不论您听到我遭受 什么厄运，请不要存片刻的不安，因为失去了您，对我来说其他一切都无所谓了。
啊，苏菲亚！离开您真不容易，更难的是要求您把我忘掉，然而为了最真挚的爱情，我 必须二者都做到。请恕我冒昧，以为您记起我来的时候会感到不安。不过，如果处于落魄境地 的我有此荣幸，为了您的安宁，请即将我抛个一干二净吧。就当作我从来也没爱过您，要不， 就当我跟您一点儿也不相配，并且学着鄙视我，以我的僭妄，理应受到最严厉的惩罚......我写 不下去了......愿守护天使永远庇佑着您！
他在衣袋里摸索，想找点火漆，可是没有找到；衣袋里空空的，什么 也没有。原来在他痛心疾首的那一阵，他把身上带的一切东西都扔掉了， 其中也包括奥尔华绥先生赠给他的那个皮夹，他一直也没打开过，而且此 刻才记起它来。
这家给了他一点胶纸片，可以派上用场，他就把信封起来，然后赶忙 朝那溪畔走去，寻觅他丢在那儿的东西。路上，他碰见他的老朋友黑乔 治，这个看猎场的对琼斯不幸的遭遇深表同情，原来这件事已经传到黑乔 治的耳朵里，而且那一带人人都晓得了。
琼斯就告诉黑乔治他丢失了些什么东西，看猎场的马上就陪他回到小 溪那边，他们把琼斯踏过和没踏过的每一丛草都找遍了，可是什么也没找 到。琼斯的东西虽然确乎还在草地上，不过，他们单单没搜寻那东西所在 的地点，也就是这位乔治的口袋。他是刚才拾到的，亏得认出了这东西贵 重，就小心翼翼地揣起来留作己用了。
看猎场的不辞劳苦，东跑西颠地寻找失物，似乎真是希望找到的样 子。他要琼斯先生回想一下有没有到过旁的地方，说："要是刚刚才丢的， 东西应该还在这儿呀。这地方不大有人走过的。"事情倒确是这样，乔治自 己路过这片野地也是十分偶然的一一他是去张网捉兔子，好在第二天早晨 卖给巴思的野味贩子。
这时，琼斯对找回失物已经不再存什么希望了，甚至连想也不再去想 它。他转过身来十分殷切地问黑乔治，肯不肯帮他一个天大的忙。
乔治带点踌躇地回答说："先生，凡是我能尽力的事，都随您吩咐，这 您是知道的。但愿我能为您效点劳。"其实，琼斯这个问题使他有些窘。自 从他到魏斯顿先生家里去干活，凭着卖野味，手里也颇积攒下几个钱，生 怕琼斯向他挪借一文半文的。不过这种疑惧马上就消解了，原来琼斯是要 他送一封信给苏菲亚，这件事他欣然答应下来。老实说，琼斯先生委托的 事，他大都乐意去办的，因为他还是十分感激琼斯的好处，同时，他也跟 那般爱金钱胜于一切的人一样诚实。
两个人一致认为这封信应该由昂诺尔大姐转给苏菲亚，然后就分了 手。看猎场的回到魏斯顿先生的庄园上，琼斯就走到离那里有半哩地的一 家酒馆去等回音。
乔治刚一回到主人家里就遇到昂诺尔大姐。他先跟她扯了几句，然后 把那封致小姐的信交给她，又从昂诺尔那里拿到小姐写给琼斯先生的信 ――昂诺尔对他说，这封信她足足揣了一整天，差不多已经放弃把它递出 去的希望了。
看猎场的兴高采烈地赶回琼斯的身边。琼斯接到苏菲亚的信，立刻退 到一边，急切地把信拆开。信里写道：
先生：
自与您分手以来，我的种种感触是无法言说的。您为我之故，默然忍受家父对您的种种 粗暴无礼，我当终生铭感。您素知他的脾气，因此，我求您为了我的缘故而回避他一下。可惜 我没有什么可以慰藉您的，不过，请您相信：我决心抵抗到最后一刻，决不把我的手或心交给 您所不愿意我交给的那个人。
这封信琼斯看了不止一百遍，并吻了无数次。他心里又荡漾起一片柔 情蜜意。他后悔不该给苏菲亚写上述那样一封信，更后悔趁着黑乔治送信 的工夫，又给奥尔华绥先生写了一封信，托人捎去了。信里答应放弃对苏 菲亚的爱情，并且保证决不食言。不过，当他的头脑恢复冷静的时候，他 清楚地看到自己的处境并不因为苏菲亚这封短简而有所改善或改变，只是 从苏菲亚的坚贞不渝中得到一线希望，日后事情说不定会有个转机。因
此，他决计不再改变主意，就辞别了黑乔治，朝约莫五哩外的一个镇子走 去他曾经要求奥尔华绥先生把他的衣物送到那个镇子上去，除非乡绅 撤销了他的判决。
第十三章
苏菲亚在当前处境下所采取的行动一一凡是可能采取这种行动的女 人都不会责备她;在良心法庭上争辩的一个难题
对苏菲亚来说，这二十四个小时可不好过。大部分时间她都在听着她 姑妈长篇大论地讲着处世稳重之道，劝她仿效上流社会的榜样。据这位好 心肠的姑妈说，眼下在上流社会里，爱情只不过是个拿来嘲弄的东西；上 流妇女看待结婚就跟上流男人看待公职一样，只是个发财致富、飞黄腾达 的手段罢了。谈起这个题目来，魏斯顿女士真是口若悬河，滔滔不绝地说 了几个钟头。
这番明智的言辞既不合苏菲亚的口味，也不合她的心意，可是毕竟没 有她自己想心思那么苦恼一一那心思搅得她一夜也不曾阖眼。
尽管她在床上不能入睡，也不得安息，可是因为没有旁的事可做，就 只好躺在那里。上午十点多钟她父亲才从奥尔华绥先生家里回来，看到她 仍然躺着。他径直走进她的卧室，推开门，看到她还没起床，就大声 说："哦，你没有跑掉呀，那么我就叫你再也跑不掉了。"然后，他就把门 锁上，把钥匙交给昂诺尔；事先严词责令她好生看守，答应她要是忠于职 务必有重赏，倘若辜负了主人的嘱托，就会受到极其可怕的惩罚。
他吩咐昂诺尔的是：没有乡绅本人的许可，不得让小姐走出房门，同 时，除了乡绅和苏菲亚的姑妈，不准任何人去见她。苏菲亚要什么，昂诺 尔都可以照给，但是笔、墨水和纸张一律禁止她使用。
乡绅还吩咐他女儿打扮起来去陪他用饭，苏菲亚从命了。她像往常一 样坐了那么一段时候，就又被领回牢里去了。
晚上，狱卒昂诺尔把看猎场的捎来的信递给了苏菲亚。她聚精会神地 读了两三遍之后就倒在床上痛哭起来。昂诺尔大姐看到小姐这样，大吃一 惊，禁不住殷切地问起来由。苏菲亚有一阵子没回答什么，然后，蓦地跳 起来，抓住女仆的手嚷着："哎，昂诺尔，我完啦！"昂诺尔大声说："老天 保佑！早晓得这样，我就烧掉那封信，不把它交给您啦。当然喽，我原以 为那封信会宽宽小姐的心，不然的话，我宁可让它去见魔鬼，也不碰一 碰。"苏菲亚说："昂诺尔，你是个好心的姑娘，有件窝心事，我也用不着 再瞒你了 ：我爱上了一个人，如今，那个人把我抛弃啦。”女仆回答 说："难道琼斯先生会是个这么不讲信义的人吗？”苏菲亚说："他在那封信
里向我告了永别。他还要求我把他忘掉。要是他真爱过我的话，他能这么 要求吗？他能够忍心这么想吗？他能写出这样的话来吗？ ”昂诺尔大声 说："当然不能，小姐。不过，说真的，就是全英国天字第一号男人要求我 把他忘掉，我也一定照办。哼，我看还是小姐太过于抬举他了，才会想念 他。像您这样一位小姐，全国的年轻人还不是随您挑去。不过，说真的， 要是不嫌我冒昧，容许我说点糊涂想法的话，那我认为还是布利非先生相 宜；他不但出身清白，将来一定是这一带数一数二的乡绅。照我看来，不 论长相还是礼貌，他都要强多了。而且这位少爷为人稳重，四邻谁也讲不 出他的什么不干不净的话；他不追烂女人，所以谁养的野种也算不到他的 账上来。把琼斯先生忘掉吧！谢天谢地，我还不至于那么倒霉，让个男人 两次要我忘掉他。纵使他是个了不起的美男子，如果他竟敢向我提出这么 无礼的要求，只要世上的年轻男人还没死光，我就跟他一刀两断。而且， 我刚才说过，横竖还有布利非少爷在呢……"苏菲亚嚷道："别提他那个可 恶的名字！"昂诺尔说："小姐要是不喜欢他的话，另外也有的是活泼、漂 亮的小伙子会来追求您，只要小姐稍微给他们一点鼓励就成了。小姐只要 对咱们本郡或者邻郡里哪位少爷稍稍有点意思，我相信他会马上登门来求 亲的。"苏菲亚大声说："你在我耳边咕叽这不三不四的话，你把我当成什 么啦！我恨所有的男人。"昂诺尔回答说："说真的，小姐，您对男人已经 腻烦了。又受到这样一个穷光蛋、叫花子、野种的欺负……"苏菲亚嚷 道："别胡说八道！你怎么敢当着我面侮辱他的名字！他欺负我？唉，当他 写下那些残忍的话语的时候，他那颗惨痛的心要比我读信时候受的折磨更 大啊！啊，他完全是英雄般高贵和天使般善良。我很惭愧由于自己情感上 的脆弱，本来应该称赞的，我反而去责难。啊，昂诺尔，他心里考虑的只 是为了我好。为了我的幸福，他把他自己和我都牺牲了。为了怕毁掉我的 一生，他才悲观绝望。"昂诺尔说："小姐想到这一点，我听了很是高兴。 说真的，您要是把心交给一个被赶出大门、而且连一个铜板的财产也没有 的人，那您的一生可真就毁啦。"苏菲亚赶紧嚷道："赶出大门！怎么？你 这话指的是什么？”昂诺尔说："小姐，说真的，咱家老爷刚把琼斯先生追 求您的事告诉给奥尔华绥先生，那位乡绅立刻就把他剥得赤条条地赶出大 门去了。”苏菲亚说："哎，都是我这个倒霉鬼害了他！赤条条地赶出大 门！来，昂诺尔，把我所有的钱，把我手上的戒指全拿去。还有我的表， 全给他拿去。马上去找着他……"昂诺尔大姐说："小姐，您先仔细思量一
下吧。老天爷！要是短了这些东西，老爷一定要向我追查的。所以求您还 是别把表和首饰拿去。而且，我看这笔钱就蛮可以啦一一这个嘛，老爷是 —点也查不出来的。"苏菲亚说："那么就把我所有的钱全拿给他，立刻找 着他，交给他。去，去吧，一分钟也别耽误。”
昂诺尔大姐马上就遵命走了，她在楼下找到黑乔治，把钱袋交给他， 里头放着十六个基尼一一那确实是苏菲亚的全部积蓄了，尽管她父亲给的 零用钱很不少，怎奈这位小姐为人太慷慨，所以攒下的不多。
黑乔治接过钱袋来，就朝那家酒馆走去了。路上，他脑子里冒出一个 想法：应不应该把这笔钱也吞下来。这个念头一动，良心马上震惊起来， 责备他不该这么忘恩负义。贪心答辩说，在他吞没可怜的琼斯那五百镑的 时际，良心就应该出来指责呀；既然那么一大笔款子都心安理得地吞了下 去，如今又在区区这笔小数目上假装出什么不安的样子，这如果不是地地 道道的伪善，就是荒谬。听到这席话，良心就像一个明辨是非的律师，指 出现在这种显然是背信弃义的行为和先前拾到失物留归己有是完全不一样 的。贪心却立刻对这种区分嘲笑说，这纯粹是庸人自扰，其中并无差异， 并且坚决认为一个人只要一度完全放弃了信义和道德，就没有再回到那个 原则上去的先例。一句话，良心给驳倒了，这时幸亏恐惧插进来，帮良心 的忙，它极力强调说，这两种行为真正的区别倒还不在道义上的高低，而 在于安全程度的不同：吞没那五百镑所冒的险是微乎其微的，而扣下这+ 六基尼却极其可能被察觉出来。
由于恐惧的友好支持，良心在黑乔治的心里取得了完全的胜利。它夸 奖了几句黑乔治为人诚实可靠之后，就迫使他把钱照数交给了琼斯。
第十四章
短短的一章，包含着魏斯顿乡绅和他妹妹之间短短的谈话
魏斯顿女士那一整天都有事出门去了。她回来的时候乡绅迎上去，她 问起苏菲亚怎样了，乡绅告诉她说，看得牢牢的。他大声说："我把她锁在 房里了，钥匙由昂诺尔拿着。"乡绅对他妹妹这么说的时候，神色之间表示 自己是多么机警、精明，看来他是期待着他妹妹对他大加赞美一番，然而 他却大失所望。魏斯顿女士带着十足轻蔑的神色说："哥哥，你可真是男人 中间顶不中用的蠢货了。你为什么不把侄女的事全交给我办理？你干吗非 插一手不可！我费了老大口舌，好容易才把一切安排停当，这么一下又都 完啦。我这里直往她脑子里灌输处世要稳重的大道理，你却在刺激她拒绝 这些大道理。谢天谢地，哥哥，英国女人并不是奴隶。把我们像西班牙或 意大利的妻子那样锁起来是不行的。我们跟你们男人有同样的自由权利。 你只能凭道理说服我们，不能靠力量来压服。我是见过世面的，哥哥，我 懂得该拿些什么道理来说服她。要不是你这些糊涂做法妨碍着我，我早就 把她劝服，让她按照我从前教她的那些谨慎稳重的闺范行事了……"乡绅 说："反正我总是不对的。"魏斯顿女士说："哥哥，只要你对自己不懂的事 别插手，你就不会犯错误了。你总得承认我是见过世面的。要是侄女一直 在我的教养下长大，她会有多么幸福啊！就是因为回到家里跟你住，她才 弄得满脑子荒唐的恋爱观和糊涂思想……"乡绅大声嚷道："你总不至于以 为这些东西是我教她的吧。"她回答说："正像伟大的弥尔顿所说，你差不 多耗尽了我的耐性四……"乡绅说："去他妈的弥尔顿！尽管他那么伟大， 要是他敢当面对我这么讲，我一定给他个嘴巴。耐性！要是说到耐性，妹 妹，像我这样让你当作个超龄学童对待，才更需要点耐性呢。难道你以为 凡是没出入过宫廷的人就都丝毫不识时务吗？见鬼！要是除了一小撮圆头 党和汉诺威的耗子四我们全是些傻瓜，世界可糟糕了。见鬼，该是我们捉弄 他们一下的时候了，让每个人都享受到自己的权利。妹妹，就是这样，让 每个人都享受到自己的权利。妹妹，我希望别等汉诺威的耗子吃光我们的 谷子，只给我们剩点子胡萝卜过活。"魏斯顿女士嚷道："哥哥，你简直莫 名其妙。什么胡萝卜呀，汉诺威的耗子呀，我一点也不懂。"他叫着："我 相信你是听不进去。尽管这样，国家的利益迟早要受到维护的。"那位女士 回答说："但愿你考虑考虑你女儿的利益。相信我的话，她目前的处境比国
家的形势还要危险。"乡绅说："可是刚才你还责备我对她管得太多，要我 把她全交给你。”她回答说："要是你答应不再插进来，为了疼爱我的侄 女，我愿意把这份责任担负下来。"乡绅说："那么好吧，就由你管去吧。 你晓得我一向认为女人的事还是应该由女人去管。”
然后，魏斯顿女士就走开了，一边嘴里还咕哝着一些对女人和治理国 家大事表示轻蔑的话。她立刻来到她侄女的卧房。经过一天的囚禁，苏菲 亚又重获自由了。

三天里的事
第一章
世界与舞台的比较
人们往往把世界比作舞台，许多严肃的作家以及诗人认为人生宛如一 场大戏，几乎在每一个细节上都和据说是塞思皮斯［1］所首倡、并深为各文明 国家所赞赏的舞台演出完全相同。
这个观点引用得如此之广，流行得如此之普遍，以致有些舞台方面的 专用名词，最初还只是以隐喻方式应用于人间事务，如今已经毫无区别地 直接通用于二者了。因此，不但在专谈戏剧演出时，就连谈起日常生活 来，我们也习惯于使用"舞台”、“场景"一类字眼；而当我们提起“幕后活 动”的时候，圣詹姆斯宫⑵也许比朱瑞巷［3］更容易在我们的脑海里出现。
如果想到舞台也只不过是现实生活的再现一一或者如亚里士多德所说 的，现实生活的摹仿，那么上述这种情况就不难理解了。因而也许我们理 应高度赞美那些能用文章或是演技将人生摹拟得惟妙惟肖的人们；他们摹 拟出来的难以与原物分辨开来，以致二者竟互相混淆。
然而实际上我们却不大喜欢赞美这种人。我们对待他们就像儿童对待 玩具一样：与其赞美他们的技艺，我们情愿嘘他们，打他们，从中得到的 乐趣要大得多。除了上述的理由之外，还有许多其他理由促使我们拿人生 来与舞台相比拟。
有些人把大多数人类看作是演员，他们并不代表本人所扮演的角色， 也没有权利以那个角色自居，正如扮帝王将相的演员没权利俨然把自己看 作是帝王将相一样。因此，一个伪善者也可以说就是个演员一一实际上， 希腊人就是用同一个字来称呼二者［4］的。
人生的短促也引起人们作这种对比。不朽的莎士比亚就这样说过：
人生不过是个蹩脚的演员，
在舞台上耀武扬威，大发脾气， 然后便销声匿迹。［5］
为了弥补这个习见的引句之不足，我愿为读者另引一段。这诗虽然不 大为人所知，立意却十分高雅。这是摘自一首题名为《神祇》［6］的诗，大约
于九年前刊行于世，如今早为人忘却了一一足见好书正如好人，寿命未必 比坏的长远。
人类从您［7］那里，取得一切活动的源泉， 不论是帝国的兴起，还是君位的沦丧。 您为我们展开广大的时间舞台， 一幕幕，英雄豪杰昂首阔步， 接踵而至的都是些显赫人物。 哪些君王一败涂地，哪些领袖旗开得胜， 都不外扮演您预先指定的角色。 他们所热衷和引以为荣的， 莫不以您的意旨为依归; 刚才还满面光彩，洋洋得意， 经您一颔首，这幻觉倏地就烟消云散， 繁盛景象转眼成空， 只在记忆中留下往事的影子。
然而每当人们就这一方面以及其他方面把人生与戏剧相比拟时，总是 单从舞台方面来寻找二者共同之处。据我所知，还没人把这场伟大戏剧的 观众考虑上。
但是既然造物往往演出它的拿手好戏给满堂的观众看，因此，也可以 拿观众的一举一动像演员那样跟人生相比拟。在时光这座广阔的剧场里， 同时坐着捧场的和吹毛求疵的观众；有鼓掌喝彩的，也有怪声叫喊的。总 之一句话，凡是在皇家戏院里听得到看得见的，这里都应有尽有。
举个例来说：在上一卷第十二章里，造物让黑乔治从他的朋友兼恩人 那里携款五百镑，逃之夭夭。咱们就拿这一场戏来审视一下广大观众的态 度吧。
我相信顶层楼座［8］的观众看到这一场照例一定会嘶叫起来。大概所有不 堪入耳的野话全骂出来了。
我们再来看看下一层的观众，他们的愤恨也不相上下，所不同的只在 于没那么喧闹、粗野而已。这里的好女人们都咒诅黑乔治该去见魔鬼，其 中，许多人时时刻刻都在盼望那位长着蹄子的先生［9］快快把他抓去。
池座里，照例意见纷纭。喜欢看豪迈行为和完美品格的人，反对在舞 台上演出这种不义之行而不对人物给以严厉惩罚，以儆效尤。作者的一些
朋友大声嚷道："诸位先生，尽管这家伙是个坏蛋，然而作者是根据自然四 描绘出来的。”而所有我们这个时代年轻的批评家、录事、学徒们都说它下 流，嘟嘟嚷嚷地不满起来。
至于包厢里的观客，他们照例表现出一种彬彬有礼的风度。他们的注 意力大都在旁处，少数几个偶尔朝台上望望的说，黑乔治不是什么好人； 其余的人则在听到批评界权威的看法之前，拒绝发表意见。
得以进入造物这座伟大舞台幕后的我们（不曾获得这种特权以的作家只 配去编编字典或拼音课本）可以谴责黑乔治这种行为，而对这个人物本身 却不能抱有深恶痛绝之感一一造物也许并不打算让他在各场戏里一律扮演 坏的角色。在这方面，人生真是酷似舞台：因为同一个演员扮演英雄也扮 演恶棍，他今天赢得我们赞美，明天也许就引起我们的憎恨。正如迦里克回 ――我认为在演悲剧方面他是一位绝世天才一一有时也不惜自贬身价，担 任傻瓜这样的角色，伟大的斯奇庇奥M和聪明的雷留斯以（据贺拉斯说）多 年前也扮演过这类角色一一西塞罗甚至说他们装得"叫人难以相信地幼稚"。 其实这些人，像我的朋友迦里克一样，也只是逢场作戏而已。不过有些著 名人物在他们一生中，常常演傻子演得过于认真，以致使人怀疑，在他们 身上占上风的究竟是愚蠢还是明智，他们究竟应该受到人类的赞许还是谴 责，钦佩还是鄙夷，热爱还是憎恨。
凡是曾经在这座伟大舞台的幕后呆过些时日，十分熟悉演员使用的种 种伪装、并且也非常清楚"情感"一一这座舞台的导演及监督之离奇古怪、 喜怒无常（尽管"理性"是演出的正式负责人，但他是有名的懒汉，轻易不 肯卖点力气）的人，大概都领会贺拉斯的那句名言nil admirariM,用我们 的话说，就是对什么也不必大惊小怪。
在生活中，仅仅一桩不好的行为并不能构成一个坏蛋，正如在舞台上 仅仅扮演一次坏的角色，并不能使一个演员成为反派人物一样。"情感"有 如一个戏院老板，往往强迫演员担任某一角色，不问本人是否同意，有时 候甚至不问与他们的才能相称不相称。因此，一个人（正如一个演员）尽 可以对自己所扮演的角色提出谴责。而且我们还时常可以看到有些人装出 一副邪恶的样子，尴尬得就像由威廉•密尔斯四先生那张厚道的脸来表演埃 古叫这个角色。
大体说来，公正而对事物具有真知灼见的人是不轻易谴责旁人的。他 可以责备一种缺点或者甚至一种罪恶而不痛骂那个犯罪的人。一言以蔽
之，不论在生活中还是在舞台上，引起叫嚣和喧闹的正是同样的愚蠢，同 样的幼稚，同样的缺乏教养和同样的乖张。世间最坏的人嘴上总是经常挂 着"流氓”，"坏蛋”，正如那些顶下流的家伙最容易在池座里嚷着："下流！ ”
第二章
琼斯先生自营自语
第二天清早，琼斯接到奥尔华绥先生家里送来的衣物和这样一封回 信：
先生：
家舅父嘱我通知阁下：他在那样处置您之前，并非未经周密考虑，对阁下品行之卑劣， 也已证实无讹；因此，您已永无改变他这一决心之可能。至于来信所云您已完全无意于某某小 姐，如此大言不惭，使家舅父不胜惊讶之至。那位小姐的出身、家业与阁下皆悬殊远甚，您根 本不应存此非非之想。最后，我谨奉舅父之命正告阁下：您唯一能顺从他的意旨之事，即立刻 离此他去。我身为基督教徒，在信末不得不对您进一忠告：愿您深思熟虑，改过自新。我当经 常祷告上帝帮助您知非悔过。
彳卜布利非谨上
这封信在我们这位主人公心里所引起的反应是极为矛盾、复杂的。最 后，还是温和情绪战胜了愤懑和愠怒。这时，幸好一阵热泪涌来，这倒也 许使他能免于精神错乱或者肠断心碎了。
可是不大工夫他就对自己这样以泪消愁感到惭愧。他一跃而起，大声 说："好吧，那么我就去做那唯一可以表明我顺从奥尔华绥先生意旨的事： 我马上就动身。去哪里呢？那就听天由命吧。既然没人在乎我这个倒霉鬼 遭遇如何，我自己也就无所谓了。我就独自来关怀这再没有一个人会一一 啊，怎么能说没有一个人呢？还有一个比整个世界还更宝贵的人呢！我可 以一一我必须想到我的苏菲亚对我的遭遇不会漠不关心的。那么我怎能忍 心离开我这唯一的知己一一而且是这样一位知己啊！为什么不留下来同她 在一起？可是在哪里啊一一我怎么能同她在一起？尽管她也渴望见我一 面，我能指望见她一面而不致惹得她父亲向她发脾气吗？而且究竟图个什 么？难道我忍心去劝这位可爱的姑娘同意走上毁灭她自己的道路吗？难道 我竟然用这样的代价来满足我自己的情感？难道我能怀着这样的企图像个 小偷一般鬼鬼祟祟地在这一带转悠吗？不，我藐视、我憎恨这种想头。再
见吧，苏菲亚！再见了，最可爱，最亲爱的……"说到这里，一阵激情堵住 了他的嘴，这激情却在他的眼睛里找到了出口。
琼斯既经下决心要离开这一带，就开始思量起该到哪里去。这世界， 正像弥尔顿所说，整个儿摆在他面前四，而且琼斯也恰似亚当一样，找不到 一个可以呼求慰藉和帮助的人。他的一切熟人也都是奥尔华绥先生的相 识。既然他已经失宠于奥尔华绥先生，也就不能再指望得到这些人的帮 助。德高望重的人在抛弃依附于他们的人时应该格外慎重，因为那个不幸 者一旦被他们所抛弃，旁的人也都会弃之不顾的。
琼斯接着考虑该走向怎样一条求生之路，或者干点什么行当：他只感 到前景惨淡而渺茫。各种职业或手艺全得花费一定时间去学，更要命的 是，学艺也需要钱；事情就是这样安排定的："无中不能生有"不但适用于 物理学，就是在社会生活中也是句至理名言。囊空如洗的人也决不可能弄 到一文钱。
最后，海洋，这个不幸者的慷慨好客的朋友，向琼斯张开了宽大的臂 膀，他马上决定接受它恳切的邀请。说得直截了当一些：他决定到海上 去。
这个念头一出现，他就紧紧抓住，立刻催马朝布里斯托尔进发，以便 把这个想法变成事实。
但是在陪琼斯先生远途跋涉之前，让我们先回到魏斯顿先生家里一会 儿，看看可爱的苏菲亚的遭遇如何。
第三章
几段谈话
琼斯先生动身的那天早晨，魏斯顿女士把苏菲亚叫到她房间里；先告 诉她说，已经替她在乡绅面前争得了自由，然后就对婚姻问题发表了一番 宏论。她并不像诗人那样把结婚描写成从爱情产生出来的美妙无比的幸 福，也不像牧师那样把婚姻当作神权为了某种目的而建立起来的制度；她 把婚姻看作一种投资，谨慎的妇女在有利的条件下把自己的资财存进这 里，是为了可以拿到比旁处更优厚的利息。
魏斯顿女士讲完之后，苏菲亚回答说，她没有本事来和她姑妈这样见 多识广的人争辩，尤其在这个她很少考虑过的婚姻问题上。
"孩子，跟我争辩！"她姑妈说，"我倒没这么指望。要是我得跟你这般 年龄的去争辩，那我可就真是白白见到很多世面啦。像苏格拉底、阿尔西 比亚迪斯M等等古代哲学家，向来都不跟他们的学生争辩什么的。孩子，你 应该把我当作苏格拉底，我不是要问你的意见，只是告诉你我的见解。"从 最后这句话，读者也许会猜测到这位姑妈对苏格拉底的哲学，就和她对阿 尔西比亚迪斯的哲学一样，是如何一窍不通了。不过我们确实无法解答读 者的这一怀疑。
"姑姑，”苏菲亚说，"我对您的一切见解，从来也不敢辩驳什么。不 过，我刚才已说过，关于婚姻这个问题，我一直没考虑过，也许以后永远 也不会去考虑它。”
"真的，苏菲，"姑妈回答说，"这样向我隐瞒真情可也未免太幼稚啦。 要是你能哄我相信你从来也没认真考虑过婚姻问题，那样法国人也可以让 我相信他们攻城掠地只不过是出于自卫了。孩子，既然你明明晓得我完全 清楚你打算跟谁结婚，怎么还能装着否认你有过结婚的念头？一一这种结 合之不自然，对你之不利，正像单独跟法国结盟之不利于荷兰一样！四不 过，若是你真的以前还没考虑过这件事，听我话吧，现在该是考虑的时候 了，因为你爹决定马上替你跟布利非少爷订婚，而且我在这件事上还是个 保人一一我在你爹面前担保你一定会同意。”
"姑姑，真的，"苏菲亚嚷道，"唯有在这件事上，您的和我爹的意旨我 都不能顺从。这门亲事我用不着考虑什么就决定拒绝了。”
“如果我不是像苏格拉底那样伟大的哲学家的话，"魏斯顿女士回答 说，"我早就发火啦。你究竟凭什么理由反对那位少爷？"
"在我看来，"苏菲亚说，"有一个很实在的理由一一我恨他。”
"难道你永远也学不会用词得当一点吗？"姑妈说。"真的，孩子，你应 该查查贝雷字典丝。对一个从没损害过你的人，是不可能去仇恨的。因此， 你所说的'恨'，只不过是'不喜欢'，而不喜欢并不足以作为反对跟他结婚的 理由啊。我认识许多夫妻，他们谁也不喜欢谁，可是却过着舒服而体面的 生活。孩子，相信我吧，对这类事情我比你要懂得多了。你总得承认我是 见过世面的，在我所熟识的女人当中，没有一个不是宁愿让人家觉得她不 喜欢自己的丈夫的，痴情相爱早已不时髦了，谁都连想也不敢再去想它 了。”
"可是，姑姑，"苏菲亚回答说，"我决不跟一个我所不喜欢的人结婚。 既然我已经答应我爹永远不会违背他的愿望而嫁给一个他所不同意的人， 想来我也可以指望他永远不会违背我的愿望来硬强迫我嫁给一个我所不同 意的人。”
"愿望！"姑妈带些气愤嚷道，"愿望！你这种自以为是的态度真叫我吃 惊。女孩子小小年纪，又还没出嫁，谈得上什么愿望！但是不管你的愿望 怎样，反正你爹已拿定主意了。而且，既然你说自己的愿望如何如何，我 倒要催他快一点。哼，你的愿望！ ”
这时，苏菲亚就跪倒在地，一双明眸泪如泉涌。她哀求姑妈怜悯怜悯 她，不要因为她不肯陷入痛苦的深渊就忍心生她的气。她一再陈说这件事 情涉及的只是她本人，这关系到她终身的幸福。
就像一个衙吏，一旦凭着拘票把不幸的债户抓到手，随便那被俘获来 的可怜虫怎样痛哭流涕，都引不起他一点点同情。对这种哀求，他无动于 衷。尽管债户的妻子指着那牙牙学语的男孩或是惊慌失措的女孩，呼吁失 去丈夫的痛苦，也不足以使衙吏有丝毫的犹豫。这位高贵的衙吏对一切灾 难都熟视无睹，哭泣之声他也充耳不闻；他的心不为任何凄惨情景所动， 不把他拘捕来的不幸者交到狱卒手里决不罢休。
这位手段高强的姑妈对苏菲亚的眼泪也正是这么熟视无睹的，对她的 哀求也是这么充耳不闻的。她也正像衙吏那么坚定不移地要把这个浑身颤 抖着的姑娘交到狱卒布利非的双臂里。魏斯顿女士十分暴躁地回答说："姑 娘，这件事非但不仅只涉及你一个人，而且你个人是微不足道的，至少是
最不重要的。这门亲事关系到咱们这个门户的光彩，你个人只不过是件工 具而已。姑娘，在王室之间的联姻上，譬如法国公主嫁到西班牙去，难道 你真的以为那只关系到公主一个人吗？不，与其说那是两个人的结合，倒 不如说是两个王国之间的结合。对于像咱们这样的世家，情形也是这样。 主要的是两家的联姻。你应当把家内的光彩看得比个人幸福更重要。如果 举一个公主的例子还不能激发起你这种高贵的思想，那你今天受到的待遇 并不比世上所有的公主还要坏，你准就没有什么可抱怨的了。”
"姑姑，"苏菲亚稍微提高了嗓音嚷道，"我希望自己永远也不会做出辱 没家内的事来；可是说到布利非先生，不论后果怎样，我也决不会同意 的，而且任凭什么力量也不能强迫我对他有好感。”
上面这番谈话魏斯顿站在内外大半都听见了。这时他再也按捺不住， 就气冲冲地闯进门嚷道："不把你嫁给他，我就他妈的不算人；嫁不成我不 算人，哼，哼，嫁不成，他妈的我不算人。”
本来魏斯顿女士对苏菲亚积下了一肚子的怒火，这时就全都发泄在乡 绅的头上了。"哥哥，既然你已经把事情交我一手办理了，你干吗又插进 来，真是奇怪！我是为了顾全咱家的名声才亲自出面来调停的，这样好矫 正你在女儿的教育方面所犯的错误。哥哥，都是你一一是你的荒唐行为毁 掉了我以前在她那幼稚的心灵上播下的一切种子。是你自己教她不听话 的！皿胡说八道！"乡绅满嘴冒着白沫说道，"你会逼得连魔鬼都忍无可 忍！难道我曾经教过我女儿不听话？她就在眼前。老老实实说吧，丫头， 我有没有教过你不听我的话？难道不就是为了叫你听我的话，我才事事顺 着你，叫你心满意足！而且小时候她本来十分听我的话的，自从你把她接 去，在她脑袋里灌满了你那宫廷里的一套想法，才把她惯坏的。喏，喏， 喏，刚才我还听到你在告诉她一举一动一定要像个公主咧。你已经把这姑 娘变成个辉格党省啦，那么我这个做爹的以及旁的人还怎么能指望她听话 呀。""哥哥，”魏斯顿女士带着十足的轻蔑神情说，"我没法表示我多么瞧 不起你那套政治见解，不过我也请你这位小姐说说，我可曾对她讲过什么 不要听话的道理没有？侄女，恰好相反，我不是尽量启发你对社会上的种 种关系要有个真实的概念吗？我不是费尽心机来向你指出：自然定律责令 子女必须孝顺父母吗？难道我没告诉过你柏拉图关于这个问题所讲的话？ ――当你刚归我管教的时候，你对这个问题是一窍不通，我相信你甚至连 什么叫父女关系也不懂得……""你这是胡扯！"魏斯顿回答说。"我女儿不
是那样的傻瓜，长到+一岁连跟她老子的关系也不晓得！""哼，比个不开 化的人还要糊涂！"姑妈回答说。"至于你的礼貌，哥哥，老实告诉你，真 该挨一顿打。""嗬，你以为你可以揍我一顿，"乡绅嚷道，"那么，来吧。 而且我估量你那侄女还会来帮你一手哩。""哥哥，”魏斯顿女士说，"尽管 没有言词能形容出我有多么瞧不起你，可是我再也不能忍受你这种傲慢无 礼了。立刻给我套上车，我要今天早晨就离开你家。""走了才痛快哪，"他 回答说，"既然你这么说，我也干脆告诉你吧，你那种傲慢无礼的派头我也 受够啦。他妈的，成天价当着我女儿的面说你怎么瞧不起我，光这么着就 蛮够叫我女儿贬低我的见识了。""不可能再贬低啦！不可能啦。"姑妈大声 叫道，"没人能再贬低一个老粗！""老猪！”乡绅回答说，"我不是老猪，也 不是头驴；不，也不是耗子。别忘记，女士一一我不是耗子！我是一个货 真价实的英国人，并非你们那帮把英国啃得精光的汉诺威耗子。""你就是 凭着一肚子糊涂道理祸国殃民的那类聪明人，"她大声说，"在国内，你们 削弱政府的权力；在国外，你们灭自己人的锐气，长敌人的威风。""嗬， 又谈起你那套政治来啦，"乡绅嚷道，"你那一套值个屁！"他在说最后那个 字的时候，还做了个与之相配合的姿势。究竟是因为他使用了这个字眼， 还是由于乡绅对他妹妹在政治上的轻蔑，我不去断言，总之，魏斯顿女士 气极了。她大发雷霆，嘴里骂出不便在这里重述的话，然后立刻奔出了大 门。乡绅和苏菲亚都不知该拦住她还是跟她一道出去好。他们一个满怀忧 虑，一个气昏了头，都不知所措地呆立在那里。
乡绅却在他妹妹背后嚷了一声："呼啦！"这是猎人看到猎犬把野兔惊 起时发出的叫嚷。乡绅十分善于这种叫嚷，而且随便遇到什么场合，他都 能很恰当地"呼啦”这么一声。
要是像魏斯顿女士那样见过世面，又研究过哲学和政治的妇女，一定 会马上利用魏斯顿先生此时此刻的心情来贬低他那个不在场的对手，对他 的见识来一番巧妙的恭维；然而可怜的苏菲亚却实在太单纯了。我说单 纯，并无意向读者暗示她愚蠢，尽管这两者通常是作为同义词来理解的。 她实在是个聪明懂事的姑娘，她的智力是头等的。然而她完全不具备妇女 在生活中施展起来可以大有好处的某种花招，那花招与其说是来自理智， 不如说是来自情感，因而最愚蠢的妇女往往得到窍门。
第四章
根据实际生活绘出的一位乡村淑女的形象
魏斯顿先生喊完了"呼啦"，喘了口气，就用十分悲怆的腔调慨叹男人 是如何倒霉。他说："做个男人不是受这个婆娘就是受那个婆娘的摆布。你 妈妈整天赶得我就够受了，好容易甩掉了她，另一条母狗又在我后边追上 了。可是谁也休想把我抓到手。”
在布利非这桩不幸的事情发生之前，苏菲亚除了替她母亲辩护以外， 从来也没在任何事情上顶撞过她的父亲。虽然她+—岁上就失去了母亲， 她却一直非常爱她。在夫妻生活中，那个可怜的女人自始至终充当乡绅忠 实的头号仆人，魏斯顿这方面也算做到了世上所谓的"好丈夫"。他很少骂她 （也许一个星期不超过一回），而且从来也没打过她。魏斯顿从来也没使 她有理由去吃醋，还任凭她自由支配自己的时间，因为他整个早晨都在野 外运动，晚上又总是和酒友们相聚。老实说，除去用饭的时间她轻易看不 到乡绅一一她先下厨亲自照料烹调，然后又亲自来切肉分菜。每顿饭后， 在其他仆人们遥遥向"流亡在海峡对岸的国王"四敬完酒退出后，再过约莫 五分钟，她也就退席了。看来这是魏斯顿先生的吩咐，因为他一向主张女 人要随着第一道菜入席，然后，喝完第一杯酒就退席。这道命令服从起来 倒也不是什么难事，因为席面上的谈话（如果可以称作谈话的话）在一个 女人家听来并没甚趣味，大部分只是怪声叫喊，唱些歌子，讲些狩猎奇谭 和冶游的事，谩骂女人和政府而已。
然而这是魏斯顿先生唯一看到他妻子的场合，因为上床的时刻，他总 是醉得什么也看不见了；在打猎的季节，他又总是天明之前就爬了起来。 因此，她完全可以支配自己的时间，而且还备有一辆驷马高车供她使用， 可惜附近一带没有像样的人家，道路又坎坷不平，因而她很少乘用一一凡 是珍惜自己性命的人，谁也不会在这里穿梭，珍惜时间的人，也不会去串 内。老实告诉读者吧，魏斯顿这番厚意并没赢得她应有的感激，因为她是 被疼爱她的父亲违反她的意愿硬逼着嫁来的，因为这门亲事对女儿有利， 乡绅每年的收益在三千镑以上，而她的家产才不过八千镑。她也许因此养 成略微忧郁的性情，与其说她是位贤妻，倒不如说她是名忠仆。对于乡绅 每见到她的时候所表现出的那种异乎寻常的狂欢，她也不知感念，难得报 以愉快的笑容。有时候她还去干涉与她毫不相干的事，比如她丈夫的纵
酒；她会抓住寥寥无几的机会，用最温和的言词规劝他。曾经有一回她十 分认真地恳求乡绅带她到伦敦住上两个月，乡绅断然拒绝了。从那以后， 魏斯顿还一直为这事生她的气，他完全相信在伦敦所有做丈夫的没有一个 不是戴绿帽子的。
为了上述这件事以及旁的许多原因，魏斯顿终于痛恨起他的妻子来 了。在她生前，乡绅从来也没隐瞒过这种仇恨，她去世以后，他也一直没 忘掉这笔账。要是他遇上什么晦气的事，比如天气坏，辨不出猎物的方 向；要不就是猎狗闹病，以及其他类似的倒霉事，他嘴里总是借死者来出 气说："要是我老婆还活着，她一定趁愿的。”
他尤其喜欢当着苏菲亚的面这么咒骂，这是因为他爱女儿胜过任何 人，而女儿却爱她的亡母甚于乡绅自己，这着实使他十分妒忌。而每逢这 种场合，苏菲亚的态度还总是对他火上加油。因为他并不满足于苏菲亚光 是听着他咒骂她的亡母，还想要她也附和这种咒骂一一这一点，任凭他许 诺什么还是怎样威胁，苏菲亚总也不肯从命。
有些读者也许会奇怪何以乡绅不像恨他的妻子那样恨苏菲亚。我必须 告诉这些读者：恨即使以妒忌为媒介，也决不是爱的结果。心怀妒忌的人 很可能会动手去杀害他们所妒忌的对象，然而他并不恨他们。以上这种情 绪颇为费解，并且带有自相矛盾的意味。所以这一章我们就此打住，好让 读者细细去寻味一番。
第五章
苏菲亚对姑妈的宽厚行径
刚才魏斯顿说那番话的时候，苏菲亚一直保持缄默，除了一声叹息， 什么也没说。但是由于乡绅根本不懂这种无声的语言一一或者如他所说 的"眼语”，所以他非要女儿对他那番高论明白表示赞许不可。乡绅像往常 那样埋怨女儿说，只要有人反对他，苏菲亚总是立刻就跟那些人站在一 边，就像她总是站在她那混账妈妈一边一样。苏菲亚听了还不做声，他就 嚷道："怎么，你哑巴了吗？为啥不说话？对我来说，你妈妈是不是个混账 东西？告诉我！哦，你大概也不把你老子瞧在眼里吧，认为我不配跟你说 话！”
"爹，看在老天面上，"苏菲亚回答说，"别把我的沉默解释成这么没心 肝吧。我宁愿死掉也决不犯对您失敬的罪过。可是我怎么好开口呢，一说 话不是得罪我亲爱的爹，就是对我的亡母犯下最可怕的不孝的罪过。而她 是世上最仁慈不过的妈妈，我相信她对我一直是这样的。”
"这么说，你姑姑也一定是世上顶好的姑姑啦！"乡绅说，"你肯不肯承 认她是个混账东西？这一点，你非同意不可！”
"可是爹，"苏菲亚说，"姑姑待我很好。她是我第二个母亲。”
"那也就是我的第二个老婆了，"魏斯顿回答说，"所以你就站到她那一 边去喽！难道你还不承认她是世上最可恶的妹妹？"
"真的，爹，"苏菲亚嚷道，"我要是那么说，我就是昧心。我了解您跟 我姑姑的想法大不相同。可是我无数次听到她表示对您最深切的爱。我相 信她不但不是您的最可恶的妹妹，恰恰相反，世上做妹妹的很少有像她那 么敬爱哥哥的。”
"干脆说吧，"乡绅回答说，"我错啦。哼，当然是这样。对的总是女 人，错的总是男人。”
"对不起，爹，"苏菲亚嚷道，"我可没这么说。”
"没说什么？”她父亲说。"既然你胆敢说她对了，难道那还不就是说我 错了吗？也许我确实做错了，竟让这个汉诺威的长老会派混账东西进了我 的家内。谁知道她肚子里藏些什么坏主意！说不定她打算把我的产业捐给 政府哩。”
"爹，"苏菲亚说，"姑姑不但没损害过您或是您的产业，我敢说，要是 我姑姑昨天去世的话，她一定会把她的全部产业都留给您。”
苏菲亚这么说究竟是有意还是无意，我不敢断言；可是最后这句话确 实深深刺进了她父亲的耳朵，比她所有的话引起的反应都更强烈。他听到 这话之后，那副表情就像脑袋上中了颗子弹。他大吃一惊，脚下站立不 稳，脸色刷地变得惨白；足足有一分多钟连话都说不上来，然后才嗫嚅地 说："昨天！昨天她一定会把她的财产留给我！她会吗？一年三百六+五 天，为什么单单挑昨天？这么说来，要是她明天死掉，财产就会留给旁人 吧一一甚至留给外人。""爹，”苏菲亚嚷道，"我姑姑很容易激动。她发起 脾气来我可说不定她会做出什么事来！”
"你说不定！"她父亲反问道，"请问，是为了谁的缘故才让她发那么大 脾气的？不，是谁真正惹了她？我还没进屋以前你不是就跟她顶起嘴来了 吗？而且，我们吵来吵去还不都是为了你？除了为你，我多年来都没跟你 姑姑吵过一次嘴。如今，你倒把一切罪过全推到我头上来啦，仿佛她把产 业留给外人都是我造成的。我应该料到你这一手。我在旁的方面对你的疼 爱，你也总是这样报答的。”
"如果不幸我是您两位这场不和的起因，"苏菲亚嚷道，"那么我恳求您 ――跪下来恳求您，想法去跟姑姑和解一下，别让她这么生着气离开咱 家。她心地仁慈，几句好话，就会使她心平气和的。我恳求您啦，爹。”
"这么说，我还得为了你的过错去向她赔礼吗？”魏斯顿说，"你把兔子 惊跑了，要我张网去逮！要是我真的有把握……"说到这里，他停住了。苏 菲亚接着又一再哀求，终于把他说动了。乡绅对女儿说了两三句挖苦话之 后，就赶快奔了出去，为的是在他妹妹打好行装之前把她挽留下来。
苏菲亚回到她那间凄惨惨的房间，尽情去享受（倘若我可以用这个字 眼的话）相思之苦。她一遍又一遍地读着琼斯的来信。这时她的手笼也派 上了用场。信笺、手笼以及她自己都沾满泪水。在这情景之下，好心的昂 诺尔大姐竭力在旁劝慰伤心的小姐。她列举了许许多多年轻绅士的名字， 夸奖了他们的才能和仪表，然后说，随便小姐看中哪一位，都一定能够如 愿。这种药方对类似的病症过去一定是很见灵效的，不然的话，像昂诺尔 大姐这么老练的医生一定不敢贸然使用：我甚至听说女仆当中公认为这个 药方是妇科药品中的特效药。是不是苏菲亚所患的病尽管从表面症状看， 与一般妇女所患的病相同，而骨子里却大不一样，这一点我不能断言。不
过实际上这位好心的女仆不但没治好病，反而惹出了乱子，最后竟把小姐 气得发了火（这倒是难得的事），用愤怒的声调吩咐她走开。

第六章
种种不同的事情
乡绅就在他妹妹正要跨进马车的当儿赶到了。他一半靠生拉硬拽，一 半靠苦苦央求，终于劝得她吩咐把马仍旧牵回棚里去。其实，他并没费很 大事就达到了目的，因为这位女士（我们前边已经提过）性情平和；尽管 她很瞧不起乡绅的才学，或者说得更确切一些，认为他没见过世面，然而 她对哥哥却一直有着深厚的感情。
可是先前替他们谋求和解的可怜的苏菲亚，却成为这场和解的牺牲 品。这时，兄妹二人异口同声地责备起苏菲亚来了，他们联合向她宣战， 并且立刻磋商怎样朝她猛力袭击。为了速战速决，魏斯顿女士建议不但立 即和奥尔华绥家缔结婚约，并且马上就办理婚事。她说，对付她侄女只能 用剧烈的办法，她相信苏菲亚意志没那么坚强，一定不会抵抗到底的。"所 谓剧烈，"她说，"我指的就是动手迅速，因为囚禁的办法或者使用武力都 是既不应该也不能够采取的。咱们要出奇制胜，而不可猛攻猛打。”
做出这些决定之后，刚好布利非先生来拜访他的意中人。乡绅一听说 布利非到来，立刻就照他妹妹所提示的那样，吩咐他女儿好生接待她的情 郎，同时恶声恶气地赌咒说，她如果拒绝的话，就要受到严厉的处罚。
乡绅气势汹汹，锐不可当。果然不出那位明智的姑妈所料，苏菲亚是 抵抗不过的。因此，她同意去接见布利非，尽管她甚至连表示同意的精神 都打不起来。老实说，对她这么深深爱着的父亲断然加以拒绝，确实也不 是件容易事。倘若不是这样，即使她的意志力再薄弱许多，也足够使她拒 绝的了。可是世人往往把那些多半出于挚爱的举动完全归之于恐惧。
因此，为了服从她父亲专断的命令，苏菲亚这时接见了布利非先生。 我们深知把这类场景详细描绘下来并不足以为读者增添什么兴味，所以这 里我们就严格遵守贺拉斯的一条原则：凡是作家认为不可能写得十分生色 的东西，就索性省略掉吧。我们认为这条原则对历史学家像对诗人一样有 益，如果遵循它，起码也会产生这样一种好的效果，于是许多大罪孽（所 有的伟大著作都被人如此称呼）就可以缩减为小罪孽了。
在这次会晤中，以布利非运用的高超手腕而言，若是换上一个人，苏 菲亚一定会把他当作知音，把自己的心思全部掏给他；然而苏菲亚对这位 年轻绅士太反感了，她决计丝毫不信赖他。天真纯朴的人一旦戒备起来，
往往能叫狡猾者无隙可乘。她对布利非的态度完全是不自然的。其实，处 女在接待一位被指定做自己的夫婿的那位男人第二次正式拜访时，通常也 正应该如此。
尽管布利非告诉乡绅说，他对苏菲亚的接待十分满意，可是魏斯顿由 他妹妹陪伴着，在门外偷听了一切，却不大高兴。他决定听从那位贤明女 人的劝告，尽快把婚事办完。于是就用猎人的口吻和他这位未来的女婿交 谈，先"呼啦"一声，接着就嚷道："跟上她，孩子，紧紧跟上她！赶快，赶 快。对啦，乖乖。抓到手啦，抓到手啦。别不好意思。我也不能空站着， 对吗？今天下午我就去同奥尔华绥把一切事情都安排妥当，明天咱们就行 婚礼。”
布利非带着极其满意的神情回答说："先生，除了和最可爱最可敬的苏 菲亚结合之外，世界上我最渴望的是和您府上结成姻亲。您不难推想我是 多么迫不及待地希望早日实现我这两个最高理想。如果我没出口向您要求 这一点，那也只是怕由于把这件喜事提得过早，越出应该严格遵守的礼 节、体统所允许的范围，从而开罪了小姐。不过，要是先生能劝她省略一 些礼仪……”
"礼仪！去他妈的！"乡绅回答说，"全是瞎扯蛋。告诉你，明儿她就嫁 给你。等活到我这年纪，你就对人情世故懂得多了。小伙子，除非万不得 已，女人是决不会表示同意的，不时兴那样。我要是死死等着苏菲亚的妈 妈表示同意，也许我今天还在打光棍儿哩。抓住她，抓住她，没错儿，小 伙子。告诉你，明儿清早她就是你的人啦。”
布利非于是让乡绅那雄辩有力的口才所说服，两人商量好当天下午由 魏斯顿去找奥尔华绥面谈，这位求婚人就告辞了。临走之前，布利非还恳 求乡绅千万不要为了急于求成而对小姐使用强迫手段一一布利非此举就犹 如教廷审判长给叛教者判了刑并把他交给官府处治时，恳求那个世俗的执 法机关不要对受刑者使用暴力手段一样。
老实说，布利非对苏菲亚已经判了刑。尽管他告诉魏斯顿说他对苏菲 亚的接待十分满意，其实，他满意的只不过是弄清楚了小姐对她的憎恨和 轻蔑，因而也就引起了他对苏菲亚同样的憎恨和轻蔑。也许有人要问：既 然如此，为什么他还不立即停止对苏菲亚的追求？我的回答是：他正是因 为对小姐怀有憎恨和轻蔑的情感才追求的。另外也还有一些同样响亮的理 由，容我一一为读者讲明。
尽管布利非先生和琼斯的性格大不相同，他也并不见了女人就想一口 吞下，然而据说一切动物所共有的那种欲望，他也决不缺乏。同时，他还 具有指导人们为满足自己的各种欲望而选择对象或是食品的那种鉴别力， 使他能一眼看出苏菲亚是极可口的美味，他看到苏菲亚就像贪吃的人望着 蒿雀那样馋涎欲滴。而且苏菲亚心怀愁苦不但没损害她的容貌，还使她更 加美丽起来，因为泪水洗得她的眼睛更加晶莹，叹息使她的胸部更加隆 起。老实说，谁要没见过愁苦中的美人，他就没看到过绝色美人。因此， 布利非这次见到苏菲亚（他心目中的蒿雀），比上回还要馋，这种情欲也 并未由于发觉苏菲亚讨厌自己而减少半分。恰恰相反，这越发使他以夺取 这位美人为快，因为在色欲的满足之外，又添上了胜利之感。他之所以要 把苏菲亚据为己有，也还有旁的想法，不过那实在太卑鄙了，甚至不屑一 提。报复也是他预期的欣慰中的一种。另外，和倒霉的琼斯角逐，夺去苏 菲亚对他的爱情也是促使布利非追求下去的一个原因。他摹想事成之后， 还将额外增添一番乐趣。
这些想法在谨言慎行的人看来，也许是过于恶毒了，然而他心目中还 有个指望，大部分读者对这个指望是不会感到怎么厌恶的，那就是魏斯顿 先生的家产。乡绅早已确定他的全部产业统统由苏菲亚以及苏菲亚所生的 子女来继承。这位痴情的父亲太溺爱自己的女儿了，只要苏菲亚肯牺牲自 己的终身，同意嫁给乡绅为她所挑选的丈夫，不论花多少钱来买这位快 婿，乡绅也是在所不惜的。
为了这种种原因，布利非先生渴望这门亲事能够结成，所以他打算哄 骗苏菲亚，装出十分爱她的样子；同时又蒙蔽魏斯顿先生和他舅舅，佯说 苏菲亚爱他。他这样做也是秉承屠瓦孔的教诲：那位塾师主张如果我们所 抱的目的符合教义（婚姻当然符合），那么只要能够达到目的，什么样的 卑劣手段都不妨采用。在其他场合，他往往运用斯奎尔的哲学。斯奎尔教 导他说：目的如何是无关紧要的，只要手段公道，合乎道德正义就成。老 实说，生活里不论碰到什么场合，利用不上这位或那位大师的教诲的事是 很少的。
哄骗魏斯顿先生不是什么难事，因为他和布利非一样，也认为苏菲亚 本人的意愿是无关紧要的。但是奥尔华绥先生的想法却大不相同，因此， 非把他也蒙蔽住不可。不过在这方面布利非大大得力于魏斯顿的协助，所 以很容易就成功了；奥尔华绥先生既然听到女方的父亲保证说，苏菲亚对
布利非相当有感情，而且以前他对琼斯的怀疑完全是捕风捉影，布利非只 消把这话证实一下就成了。这话他说得十分模棱两可，一方面替自己的良 心留出一条后路，另一方面间接骗了他的舅父而自己又不需担当撒谎的罪 名。奥尔华绥表示他决不做个帮凶来强迫一位小姐同意一门违反她本人意 愿的亲事，当他问起苏菲亚究竟同不同意的时候，布利非回答说：年轻小 姐真正的心意当然是很难捉摸的，不过，她对他的态度正像他所希望的那 样颇为热切；倘若她父亲所说的话靠得住，那么小姐对他的感情已经无以 复加了。"至于琼斯，"他说，"我不愿意管他叫流氓，尽管以他对舅父一一 您的态度来论，他完全应该得到这个称号。由于虚荣心，或者出于某种邪 恶念头，他可能胡乱替自己吹嘘。魏斯顿小姐要是对他真有些感情，凭她 那么大家当，琼斯决不会舍得放弃她的，而现在事实上他已经放弃她了， 这一点您也知道得很清楚。最后我向您保证，如果我不是确信这位小姐对 我怀有我所期望的感情，不管出于什么样的考虑，纵使把整个世界给我， 我也决不肯娶她的。”
这种用暧昧的言词和诡诈的伎俩有意进行欺骗，同时口中却又不说一 句谎言的高妙办法，曾经使许许多多著名的骗子感到心安理得。可是倘若 考虑到这些人打算欺骗的却是那无所不知的造物主，从中也就得不到什么 深切的快慰了；而在拐弯抹角地撒谎与直接撒谎之间去挖空心思，装模作 样，未免也太不值得了。
奥尔华绥对于魏斯顿先生和布利非先生告诉他的情况，十分满意，两 天之内就把婚约商定了。现在，在牧师主持仪式之前，就只剩下律师们办 手续了，看来得耽误不少时候，所以魏斯顿表示任何条款他都甘愿遵守， 只要不至于推延这对年轻人的吉期就好。老实说，乡绅是如此热心而迫不 及待，旁观者也许会把他误当作婚礼的主角了。其实，无论遇到什么场合 他向来都是这么急切的，他办起任何事情来也都是这个样子，直好像他毕 生的幸福就完全系于这件事情的成功。
奥尔华绥先生对于可以为旁人造福的事，向来是讨厌拖延的。如今， 岳父和女婿一道频频向他恳求，如果不是苏菲亚亲自出来制止，他很可能 就依从他们了。苏菲亚采取行动打消了全部婚约，并且剥夺了教会和司法 部门的一笔收入。这些贤明的机构认为既然由它们准许人类在合法的形式 下进行繁殖，它们就理应抽取一份税金。详情如何，且看下一章。
第七章
苏菲亚一个奇特的决定以及昂诺尔大姐一个更加奇特的策略
尽管昂诺尔大姐主要在意的是她自己的利益，然而对苏菲亚她多少也 有些关怀。老实说，凡是认识那位小姐的人是没法不喜爱她的。因此，昂 诺尔一听到一个她认为对小姐关系重大的消息，就完全忘却两天前被苏菲 亚斥退的那股怨气，马上跑来告诉她。
她开头讲的话正像她闯进来时一样突然。"啊，亲爱的小姐！”她 说，"您看怎么办好呀！说真话，可把我吓糊涂啦。也许您听了会生气一一 我们做底下人的对于什么会惹小姐生气，并不是件件都清楚的，反正什么 都怪到我们头上来一一可是我想我还是有责任让您晓得。小姐们一发脾 气，我们底下人当然免不了挨骂。要是您真的发脾气，我一点儿也不会奇 怪；这件事一定会叫您大吃一惊，还会吓您一跳哩。……""好昂诺尔，"苏 菲亚说，"直截了当地告诉我吧，别再绕弯子啦。你相信吧，没有什么事会 使我大吃一惊的，更没有什么事会吓我一跳。""亲爱的小姐，"昂诺尔回答 说，"说真的，我听老爷对撒波尔牧师谈起今天下午就要办好一张结婚证书 呢。真的，我还听他说，要小姐明天早晨就行婚礼。"苏菲亚听了这话，脸 上立刻变得没了血色。她着急地重复着："明天早晨！""是的，小姐，"忠 心耿耿的女仆回答说，"我愿意发誓：我确实听老爷这么说的。皿昂诺 尔，"苏菲亚说，"你这话确实把我吓得灵魂出了窍。处在这样可怕的情景 下，可怎么办好呢？""但愿我能给您出点主意，"昂诺尔说。"快说吧，"苏 菲亚叫嚷着说，"亲爱的昂诺尔，请你替我出点主意。告诉我：要是你处在 我这种情景，你该怎么办。""老实说，小姐，"昂诺尔大声说，"但愿我跟 小姐换个位置。我说这话您可不要见怪。说真的，我当然不能咒您去当底 下人，我只是说，要是我处在您的地位，我就不会感到什么为难。因为在 我看来，布利非乡绅是个温柔可爱的漂亮小伙子……""别胡扯！”苏菲亚嚷 道。"胡扯！"昂诺尔重复说，"俗语说得好：’这个人的美味却是另一个人的 毒药。’这话对女人来说也一点儿不假。""昂诺尔，"苏菲亚说，"我宁可用 一把短刀扎进我的胸膛，也决不肯做这个卑鄙小人的妻子。""哎呀，我的 天！小姐！"昂诺尔说，"您可真把我吓掉了魂。小姐，您千万可别存这种 邪念。哎，吓得我浑身直发抖。请您想想吧，那样一来就不能按照基督教 的规矩来埋葬您了，您的尸首只能埋在大道上，一根木桩子将钉牢您的身
子，就像牛岔口的庄稼汉哈佩尼一样。说真的，从那以后他的鬼魂儿一直 在那儿游来荡去，好几个人都见过。说真的，只有魔鬼才会往人脑子里塞 这种坏念头。我听不止一个牧师说过，伤害自己比伤害全世界的罪过还要 大。要是您十分讨厌那位少爷，对他恨到简直没法跟他在一个床上睡觉 ――说真的，就是会有天生对某人这么起反感的事，宁可去摸癞蛤蟆也不 愿意碰一碰他的皮肤。”
苏菲亚正在苦思焦虑，没怎么理会她的女仆前边这篇漂亮的演说。她 没回答昂诺尔的话，只打断她说："昂诺尔，我已经作出了一个决定。我决 计今天晚上就离开我爹的家。你要是真像平常说的那样对我有点情义，那 么就陪我一道走。""那是一定的，"昂诺尔回答说，"就是走到天边儿上我 也陪您去。不过我劝小姐在采取这种轻率的行动之前，一定先要好好考虑 一下后果。小姐有什么地方可投奔呢伦敦有一位贵夫人，"苏菲亚回答 说，"是我的一位亲戚。她曾经来乡下在我姑姑家住过几个月。在那段日子 里，她待我非常好，她说很喜欢和我在一起，并且一再要求我姑姑让我跟 她一道去伦敦。既然她是位很有名望的女人，一定不难打听出来。我毫不 怀疑，她一定会好好接待我的。""我看小姐还是别过于自信，"昂诺尔大声 说，"我以前服侍过的一位太太就时常极热心地请人到她家去做客，可是一 听说客人真的来了，她却总是躲开。况且就是那位夫人高兴见到您一一哪 个都喜欢见到您一一可她要是晓得您是从家里逃出来的……""昂诺尔，你 弄错了，"苏菲亚说，"她一点也不像我这样看重父亲的权威。那回她拼命 劝我跟她一道去伦敦，可是当我说没得到我爹的同意不能去的时候，她笑 话我，管我叫乡下傻姑娘：说我既然是这样一个孝女，就一定会成为一个 贤淑的妻子。所以我相信她一定会接待我，保护我，直到有一天我爹看出 对我已没奈何，就不会再这么蛮横无理了。”
"好吧，小姐；"昂诺尔回答说，"可是您打算怎么逃跑呢？哪儿去弄马 和车呢？至于您自己的那匹马，那是没指望的：宅里所有的底下人既然都 多少晓得老爷跟小姐争吵的事，要是没有老爷的吩咐，就是绞死罗宾，他 也不敢让您把马拉出棚子去的。""我打算乘大门开着的时候走出去，"苏菲 亚说，"谢天谢地，我的腿很结实。在舞伴并不怎么称心的情况下，这两条 腿也曾合着提琴的拍子支持我度过许多漫长的夜晚，如今凭着这两条腿， 我一定能逃开这个可厌的终身伴侣。""唉，老天爷！小姐您晓得您在讲些 什么吗？"昂诺尔大声说，"您打算夜间孤身一人在大路上徒步行走
吗？”"不是孤身一人，"小姐说，"你答应跟我做伴的。""那当然啦，"昂诺 尔大声说，"小姐走遍天下我也一定跟随着您；可是那又跟您孤身一人有多 大区别呢？要是遇上匪人或是歹徒，我保护不了您。我会和您一样怕得要 死的，因为他们一定会把咱们俩一起糟蹋了。而且小姐您想想看，现在夜 里多冷啊！咱们准会冻死的。""走快一点儿就冻不着啦，”苏菲亚回答 说，"昂诺尔，要是你不能从歹徒手里保护我，让我来保护你。我要带上一 把手枪。大厅里经常放着两把上好子弹的。""亲爱的小姐，您更叫我害怕 啦，"昂诺尔嚷道，"小姐，您肯定不敢开枪的！我不论冒什么险也不愿小 姐干那种事。""怎么？”苏菲亚微笑着说，"要是有人要来强奸你，破坏你 的贞操，你也不敢开枪打他吗小姐，说真的，"昂诺尔大声说，"贞操 是非常可贵的，特别是对我们底下人来说；因为正像有人说的，那就是我 们的饭碗。可是我恨死枪炮了，这类玩意儿不知伤了多少人命。""好吧， 好吧，”苏菲亚说，"我可以不带武器，而用更简便的办法来保全你的贞 操。我打算一走到个镇上就租两匹马，这段路上咱们大概不至于碰上坏 人。你听着，昂诺尔，我已经决计走了，要是你陪我去的话，我一定尽我 力所能及地酬劳你。”
苏菲亚最后这句话在昂诺尔身上起的说服作用要比前边所有的论据都 大得多。既然小姐已经拿定了主意，她也就不再劝阻了。于是，她们就讨 论起怎样设法来实现出逃的计划。这时出现了一个很大的难题，就是怎样 搬运她们的衣物一一这个问题小姐解决得要比女仆容易多了，因为当一位 小姐决心要投奔一个男人或是逃开一个男人的时候，一切障碍在她都是无 所谓的。然而昂诺尔背后却没有这种动机来支持她：她既没什么可欢喜的 事等待着她，也没什么可怕的事需要摆脱。她大部分的财产就是那些衣 服。除了它们的实际价值外，她还对几件长衫和一些旁的东西怀有特殊的 感情：不是因为穿起来格外合身，就是因为是某某人赠送的；不是因为是 新近买的，就是因为已经穿了很久；另外还有一些同样充分的理由，使她 不忍把它们丢下，听凭魏斯顿处理。昂诺尔毫不怀疑，他在盛怒之下，必 然会使这些东西全都殉难的。
这位机智多谋的昂诺尔大姐先是竭力使用全部辩才劝阻小姐出逃，如 今看到苏菲亚那么坚决，就想出一条妙计来运走她的衣物：就是想法叫老 爷当天晚上辞退她，把她赶出大门。苏菲亚非常赞成这个办法，只是不知 道怎么才能办到。"啊，小姐，"昂诺尔大声说，"这件事您交给我好啦。做
底下人的想叫老爷太太开恩把我们辞退，办法有的是。尽管有些主子由于 一时拿不出积欠下的工钱，凭我们怎么冒犯也不动气，随我们怎么嚷着要 辞工也不理，可是咱家老爷却不是那种人。既然小姐决计今天晚上走，我 准能下午就叫他把我辞掉。"当时商定昂诺尔把苏菲亚的几件衬衣和一件睡 衣打在她的行李里。小姐把她其他衣物全抛掉了，她就像水手为了救自己 的性命而把旁人的货物扔掉时那么毫不觉得可惜。
第八章
一场普普通通的口角
昂诺尔大姐刚一离开小姐的房间，就有一种东西（我不愿意像奎微多［绍 作品里的那个老妪那样随便冤枉魔鬼，也许这件事与魔鬼毫不相干）一一 可是冥冥中有一种东西向她建议：牺牲苏菲亚算了，把她的秘密全出卖给 魏斯顿先生，说不定会发一大笔财哩。许多方面的考虑都怂恿她去泄露。 她估量为乡绅办下这么一件如此重大，又如此使他满意的事，必然会得到 丰厚的报酬，这引起了她的贪心。另一方面明摆着的是出逃可能冒的风 险：黑夜、寒冷、土匪、歹人都使她心里充满了恐惧，同时这件事能否成 功也毫无把握。这些考虑在她身上起了强大的作用，她几乎下定决心要走 到乡绅跟前，把一切原委都向他和盘托出。然而昂诺尔是一位公正的法 官，她决不会只听一面之词就宣判的，一定还要听听另一造的话。从这方 面看，首先伦敦之行就是对苏菲亚的十分有力的支持。昂诺尔非常渴望看 一看那个地方，在她的想象中，伦敦乃是无美不备、无奇不有的地方，仅 次于欣喜若狂的圣徒所憧憬的天堂。其次，昂诺尔晓得苏菲亚一向手头比 老爷大方得多，权衡之下，对小姐矢忠会比出卖她获的报酬更大。然后她 又把引起恐惧之感的那些想法逐条细细盘查，公平地掂量，发现大多是捕 风捉影。当这架天平的两端刚好平衡的时候，昂诺尔又在矢忠女主人这一 端加上自己对小姐的一腔热爱，这样一来，这一头占了上风。这时，昂诺 尔忽然设想到一种情况：如果将其分量一古脑儿加在另一头，也许会产生 危险的后果。这就是：苏菲亚的许诺需要很长一段时间才能兑现；因为尽 管在乡绅去世以后，她有权继承她母亲的财产，并且在她成年时继承她舅 父留给她的三千镑，不过这些距离到手的日子还很遥远，这中间许多意外 都可能发生，使得小姐无法实现自己慷慨的诺言。另一方面，魏斯顿先生 的酬劳却可以指望马上拿到手。就在她沿着这条思路想去的时候，苏菲亚 的守护天使一一也许就是昂诺尔大姐的良心，要不就纯然是个偶然机遇， 让她碰上一件事，这件事既保住了昂诺尔的忠诚，又推动了原来那个计划 的实现。
魏斯顿女士带来的那个女仆一直认为自己在好几方面都远远比昂诺尔 大姐优越。第一，她的出身比昂诺尔高贵，因为她的外曾祖母跟一位爱尔 兰贵族是表兄妹，血统相隔不算远。第二，她挣的工资比较多。最后，她
到过伦敦，因而见过更多的世面。因此，她对昂诺尔大姐总摆些架子，并 且还硬要对方把她看作高出一头，就像各阶层的妇女在跟低于自己的人打 交道时所要求的那样。昂诺尔有时候却不同意这个想法，因而往往就有失 敬之处，所以魏斯顿女士的女仆就颇不高兴同她共事。她非常渴望早些回 到女主人自己的家去，在那里她可以随心所欲地指挥旁的用人。因此，那 天早晨魏斯顿女士正要动身的时候忽然改变了主意又留下来，使她大失所 望。从那以后，她一直都像俗语所说的有点阴阳怪气的。
正当昂诺尔如我们上面叙述的那样自己跟自己反复辩论着的时候，这 个女仆带着并非很快意的心情走了进来。昂诺尔一见她，立刻就用殷勤的 口吻说："哟，大姐，这一下咱们还能多处一阵子，可太好啦。我本来担心 我家老爷跟姑奶奶这么一吵，咱们的缘分就浅了呢。""我不晓得您说的咱 们咱们的是什么意思，"对方回答说，"我不认为这宅里的哪个仆人配跟我 论姐妹。老实告诉您，我平时往来的人地位都要比你们高。我说的倒不是 您，昂诺尔大姐，您还是很懂得礼貌的。如果您再多见见世面，那么就是 跟您一道去圣詹姆斯公园四散散步我也不觉得丢人哩。""嗬唷，嗬唷，"昂 诺尔大声说，"口气可真不小。’昂诺尔大姐’！你可以称我的姓呀。尽管我 家小姐管我叫昂诺尔，可是我跟旁人一样，也有姓呢。跟我一道散步会丢 人!哼，我不比你差什么！""你既然这么不识抬举，"对方说，"那么我就 干脆告诉你说吧：昂诺尔大姐，你比我差得远哩。在这乡村地方，我不得 不跟各色各样的下贱货打交道，可是在伦敦，我只跟上流贵妇人的女用人 交往。昂诺尔大姐，你我之间贵贱高低就是不一样。皿我也认为是不一 样，"昂诺尔回答说，"不管论年岁还是论相貌。"说到最后几个字的时候， 她昂起脑袋，翘起鼻孔，故意带着满脸轻蔑的神情从魏斯顿女士的女仆身 边走过，用裙箍狠狠地撞了一下对方的裙箍。那位女仆发出最恶毒的冷笑 说："贱东西！你不值得我生气。我也不屑跟你这种不知廉耻的婊子去骂 街。不过，我得告诉你这个贱货，你的举止就表明你出身下贱，没有教 养，这两样就使你只配给一个乡下小姐当个粗使丫头。""你骂人可不准骂 到我们小姐头上来！"昂诺尔大声嚷道，"你这是胡说八道！我家小姐比你 家主人强多了：她年纪轻，长得也比你家主人漂亮一万倍！”
这时，不幸（或者说幸好）魏斯顿女士进来了。她看见自己的女仆泪 汪汪的，她刚一走近，女仆就热泪滚滚而下。一问起原因，她说都是因为 那个东西（指昂诺尔）对她无理才惹得她流泪了。接着还说："小姐，旁的
话我可以不加理睬，可是她居然敢冒犯起您来了，说您长得丑一一是的， 她当着我面就说您是只丑老猫。我不能容忍人家说小姐长得丑。"魏斯顿女 士说："你干吗来回重复她那些辱骂？"然后转过身来责问昂诺尔大姐怎么 竟敢在谈到她的时候这么不知尊敬。"不知尊敬，小姐！ ”昂诺尔回答 说，"我根本没提到姑奶奶一个字儿。我只是说：有个人没有我家小姐漂 亮，对这一点您当然也跟我一样清楚。皿你这贱货！ ”魏斯顿女士回答 说，"我要教你这个无礼的泼妇懂得我可不是任你胡说八道的。要是我哥哥 不立刻把你赶走，我就再也不住在他家。我去找他，教他马上把你辞 退！皿把我辞退！"昂诺尔嚷着，"辞退又怎么样？世界上有的是地方可 去。谢天谢地，好仆人总不愁没人雇的。而且，老实说，要是谁不说您漂 亮就把谁赶走的话，马上您就会没人用啦。”
魏斯顿女士听罢，回答了几句一一或者不如说咆哮了一通。她的话含 混不清，原来的字句无法确辨，因此，这里我们也就把她这番不会给她大 增光彩的言词略去吧。咆哮完她就找她哥哥去了。她满脸狂怒，看来三分 像人七分像鬼。
这时，房里只剩下两个女仆，她们又开始了第二个回合的争吵，并且 很快就由动口而动起手来。胜利属于地位较低的那位，不过胜利者在血 液、头发和衣服方面，也还是遭受了一些损失。
第九章
法官老爷魏斯顿先生的英明措施。向保安官暗示录事应具备的必要 条件;以及一些表现做父亲的喜怒无常和做儿女的满怀孝心的不平 凡事例
论理学家们有时候仅凭一个论据就想证明许多东西，为政者往往自以 为得计却弄巧成拙。昂诺尔大姐也是这样：她不但没把她其余的衣物带出 来，连她身上穿的这套也几乎没保住，因为乡绅一听说她辱骂了姑奶奶， 就连声发誓要把昂诺尔送进教养所。
魏斯顿女士是位十分好心肠的女人，平日很能宽恕人。新近她搭乘的 一辆驿车翻了，把她摔到沟里去，她就没有问那个马车夫的罪。她甚至还 不顾法律的规定，拒绝告发一个抢劫她的强盗，那个强盗不但抢了她的一 笔钱，而且还劫了她的耳环，同时还骂她说："像你这么漂亮的老狗，用不 着戴这种珠宝来装饰，滚你的吧！"可是人的脾气是捉摸不定的，在不同的 时候，我们会判若两人。不管昂诺尔装得多么悔罪，也不管苏菲亚怎样替 自己的女仆求情，魏斯顿女士就是不肯从宽发落。她非要她哥哥依法严办 （仅仅依法处理是不够的）这个野女人不可。
幸而那位录事具有凡是替保安官当录事者都必不可缺的条件：那就 是，他多少懂得一些英国的法律。于是，他就在这位法官的耳边悄声说： 这位姑娘并没犯什么妨碍治安的罪名，要是把她判入教养所，那就是滥用 职权了。他还说："按照法律来说，大人恐怕不能因为她教养欠佳就把她关 进教养所去。”
凡是涉及重大案情，特别是与行猎有关的案件，法官总不大肯听录事 的劝告。许多保安官认为在办理行猎的条件时，他们的权力可以不受限 制，往往为了搜查或没收猎具，做出任意侵害旁人权利的事，有时甚至犯 下重罪。
但是昂诺尔这个过错没那么重大，对社会的危害也不大，所以法官对 录事这番劝告还算重视。老实说，在高等法院的案卷里，控告乡绅的状子 已经有两起了，谅来魏斯顿也无意招来第三起。
因此，乡绅就摆起一副贤明而庄重的面孔，"哼""嗨”了几声，就对他 妹妹说，经过再三的斟酌，他认为：既然这个案件不涉及任何妨碍治安的 行为，像法律所指的破门而入，冲破篱笆，打破脑袋，或者其他破坏行
为，就不能构成刑事罪；既没有侵害行为，又没造成损失，所以法律并没 规定给什么惩罚。
魏斯顿女士说：她远比乡绅对法律更有研究，她晓得有的仆人就因为 冒犯了主人而受到严惩。然后她又举出伦敦某某法官的名字来说："只要做 主人或主妇的提出要求，这位法官随时都可以把他们的仆人关进济良院 去。”
“在伦敦也许是这样，"乡绅大声说，"可是乡下有乡下的法律。”接 着，兄妹之间展开一场十分渊博的关于法律的争论。倘若我们认为读者中 间有人能理解他们所发的议论，我们也就把它写进这章书里了。昂诺尔这 个案子最后就提交录事来仲裁，录事赞成法官的意见。因此，魏斯顿女士 只得同意把昂诺尔赶走了事。苏菲亚马上也欣然同意了。
这样，命运女神照例开了两三个玩笑之后，一切就都安排得恰合我们 女主人公的心意。苏菲亚这是平生第一次干欺瞒的事，按说也相当成功。 老实说，我常常得出这样一个结论：假使世上诚实人肯于捣鬼，或者认为 值得去捣一次鬼的话，恶人未必能对付得了。
昂诺尔把她的角色扮演得极其得体。她一看出自己不至于给关进教养 所（一提到教养所，她心里立刻充满了种种恐怖的想法），就又摆出刚才 因恐惧而略有收敛的高傲神情。她装出身居高位者辞官时所显示的那种满 不在乎或者甚至轻蔑的态度，丢下了她的差事。如果读者乐意的话，我们 也可以说她"辞了职”。其实，辞职和被开除或被撵走的意思是差不多的。
魏斯顿先生吩咐昂诺尔快快卷铺盖，因为他的妹妹已经扬言决不肯跟 这么一个无礼的下流女人再在一所房子里同住上一宵。于是，昂诺尔就动 手收拾起来。她全神贯注地收拾，到傍晚一切就都停当了。这时，她接了 工钱，带着箱笼什物走了。宅里个个都很高兴，然而谁也没有苏菲亚高 兴。她跟女仆约好夜里十二点，当可怕的幽灵出现的时刻，在一个离她家 不远的地方见面。昂诺尔走后，苏菲亚就为自己的逃走开始作准备。
可是事先她还不得不硬着头皮去倾听两番训话，一次是她姑妈的，另 一次是她父亲的。这一回她姑妈的话比以前更加斩钉截铁了，而她父亲对 她是如此之蛮横、暴戾，吓得她只好装作顺从他的意愿。这样一来善良的 乡绅大为高兴，适才的怒容顿时变为喜颜，威胁变为许诺。他赌咒说，他 全心全意都用在女儿身上。苏菲亚对婚事的应允（他所谓的应允是从苏菲 亚这句话推断出来的："爹，您晓得我不应该，也不能拒绝您的任何断然的
命令。”）使得他成为天地间最幸福的人。于是，他就交给苏菲亚一张巨额 支票，随她去置办些心爱的物件，然后以无限的慈爱吻她，拥抱她；同 时，两行快乐的泪水就从刚才还对他的爱女冒着怒火的那双眼睛里夺眶而 出。
天下做父母的这种做法，原是极为普通的，我相信读者对魏斯顿先生 这些行径也不会感到怎么稀奇。倘若读者仍然困惑不解的话，我承认我也 无法来说明，因为我认为他非常疼爱自己的女儿，这是无容争辩的事。以 同样的行径而使自己的儿女陷入极端痛苦中的其他许多人，其实也是这样 宠爱儿女的。尽管这种行径在做父母的中间十分普遍，然而我总认为这 是"人"这个奇特动物头脑里历来所产生出来的荒谬想法中最无法说明的一 种。
魏斯顿先生后一举动大大感动了苏菲亚那颗柔软的心，使她萌生一个 念头，这是她那位深谋远虑的姑妈的口才和她父亲的恫吓所从未做到的。 苏菲亚对她父亲是那样由衷地敬重、挚爱，她生平最大的快乐莫过于经常 给他添些欢娱，有时甚至也许还能给他带来更大的快慰：乡绅几乎每天都 听到人家对苏菲亚的称赞，逢到这种时刻，乡绅总没法抑制住自己的喜 悦。因此，她深切感到：要是自己答应下这门亲事，该使她父亲感到多么 幸福啊。同时，她笃信宗教，教义上关于绝对服从的道理对她也有巨大的 影响。最后，当她设想如果自己真的成为孝道的牺牲品或者殉难者时，自 己将遭到怎样的痛苦，心头就荡漾起某种惬意的情感，尽管这种情感跟宗 教或道德并无直接联系，对于执行这两种目标却能给以有力的帮助。
想到这样一种悲壮的作为，苏菲亚不胜陶醉了。正当她过早地以孝女 自封的时候，藏在她手笼里的爱神忽然间爬了出来，就像木偶戏里的彭奇 涅罗近那样把面前的一切一脚踢开。老实说（我们决不蒙骗读者，也不把我 们女主人公的所作所为说成是出于超乎自然的动机来为她解释），这时苏 菲亚想到了她所爱的琼斯以及与他特别有关的某种希望（不论多么渺 茫），因而她那片孝心、虔敬、自豪以及这些品德所要共同促成的事，一 下子就全付之流水了。
可是在往下叙述苏菲亚的活动之前，我们得先掉转头来看看琼斯先
生。
第十章
本章写的事也许是人之常情，然而十分部俗
读者大概还记得，我们在本卷开头就和琼斯先生分手了，他朝布里斯 托尔进发，决心到海上去寻求好运，或者不如说，躲开他在陆地上的噩 运。
不幸，替他引路的那位向导对那一带很不熟悉（这原是常有的事）， 他走迷了路，又不好意思向人家打听，于是就前走走后退退，直到傍晚， 天色黑了下来。琼斯怀疑他们走错了路，就把自己所担心的事告诉了那向 导。向导坚持说他们走的路不差，而且还说，要是他连通到布里斯托尔的 路都认不得，那才是怪事哩。尽管事实上是：他要是认得往布里斯托尔的 路倒是更加奇怪哩，因为他一辈子从未到那儿去过。
琼斯并不绝对相信那个向导。走进村子，碰上头一个人他就问那是不 是往布里斯托尔的路。"你们从哪儿来的呀？ ”那人大声问道。"你别 管，”琼斯带点儿急躁地回答，"我只想知道这是不是去布里斯托尔的 路。""去布里斯托尔的路！"那人搔着脑袋大声说，"唉，老爷，沿着这条 路走下去，我相信你们今天晚上是到不了布里斯托尔的。皿请问，朋 友，"琼斯回答说，"那么该怎么走呢老爷，你们一定走岔了路。这是 去格洛斯特的路。""那么去布里斯托尔该怎么走呢？”琼斯问道。"现在你 们越走离布里斯托尔越远，”那人说。"难道说我们得走回头路？ ”琼斯 说。"可不是嘛，"那人说。"那么我们走回那小山冈上该朝哪边转 弯喏，你们得照直走。""可是我记得那里有两股路，一股朝左转，一 股朝右。皿啊，你们得贴着右边那条路照直往前走。可是别忘了先向右 转，然后朝左转，再朝右转，就来到乡绅的大宅子。从那里再一直往前 走，然后向左转。”
这时又来了一个人，问这两位要到哪里去。琼斯说了去向。这人先搔 了搔脑袋，然后倚着手中的木棍，指点他们说：一定得贴着右手走上大约 一哩或是一哩半地，再急转向左，就来到金•贝尔涅斯老爷的宅子了。"这位 金•贝尔涅斯先生是谁呀？”琼斯问道。"我的天！"那人大声嚷道，"难道你 连金•贝尔涅斯老爷都不晓得？那么你们是从什么地方来的？ ”
正当这两个人几乎使琼斯失去耐性的时候，一个衣着朴素、仪表非凡 的人（他是个教友会由会员）走上前来打招呼说："朋友，我看你们大概是
迷了路。要是你们肯听我的劝告，那么今天就不必再找了。天眼看就全黑 了，路又不好认，而且从这里到布里斯托尔的路上新近发生了好几桩抢劫 案子。这附近就有一家很好的客栈，你们和牲口都可以舒舒服服地歇上一 宵。"经过一阵劝说，琼斯同意在这家客栈过夜，就由那位朋友引路前往。
客栈老板很有礼貌。他对琼斯说：小栈招待不周，希望客人多多包 涵。他的妻子出门了，几乎把什么都锁了起来，钥匙也带走了。事实是这 样：他的一个心爱的女儿刚刚出嫁，那天早晨跟她的丈夫一道走了。这位 姑娘和她母亲就把这个可怜汉子的一切东西，连同现款，全拿个精光。尽 管他膝下有几个孩子，可是他妻子最宠爱的就是这个女儿，她心上也只有 她。为了取悦这个孩子，她甘愿牺牲一家，还搭上她的丈夫。
虽然琼斯这时并不想和人攀谈，他宁愿独自呆着，怎奈他经不住那位 老实的教友会会员一再强求一一他很希望陪琼斯坐会儿，因为他看出琼斯 的面容和举止都带着郁郁寡欢的神色。这位教友会会员认为和琼斯谈谈多 少会宽宽他的心。
他们一道坐了一阵子（这位老实人也许只当作自己是在参加一次缄默 会四），然后受到某种神灵（大概是好奇心）的感召，就说："朋友，我看 你一定是遭到了什么不幸，可是，请你想开一点吧。也许你的一位知己去 世了。要是那样的话，请想想看，你我都不免一死。既然你知道忧伤对你 的亡友不会有多少好处，那又何必去忧伤呢？咱们生下来就陷到苦难里。 和你一样，我也有自己的不幸，说不定我比你更要不幸些。尽管我每年从 田产上可以拿到一百镑进益（这对我就足够了），多谢上帝，我在良心上 没有愧疚，体质康健强壮，而且我既不欠谁一个钱，也不曾伤害过谁。然 而，朋友，想到你会和我一样痛苦，我心里是难过的。”
教友会会员说完这话，长叹了一声。琼斯这时就回答说："先生，不管 您的不幸是怎么造成的，我都替您难过。""啊！朋友，"教友会会员告诉他 说，"我的不幸完全是我的独生女造成的。她是我的掌上明珠，可是就在这 个礼拜，她私奔了，跟一个我不同意的人结了婚。本来我已经替她安排下 一门很好的亲事，替她物色了一个品行端正、家道殷实的男人，可是她偏 要自己挑选。如今，她已经跟一个穷光蛋小伙子走了。要是她像你的朋友 那样（我这么猜想）死了，我倒高兴哩。”琼斯说："您这话说得可真奇 怪！""死掉岂不比讨饭强，"教友会会员回答说，"我不是说了嘛，那个小 伙子是个穷光蛋，她当然也不会指望我给她一个先令。既然她是为了爱情
而结婚的，那么，有本事就让她靠爱情过活去吧。让她把爱情拿到集市上 去兜销，看谁会给她个银币一一或甚至半个铜板！""先生，您最清楚您自 己的家事，"琼斯说。"他们一定老早就打好主意要骗我了，"教友会会员接 着说下去，"因为两个人从小就相识。我总是不断地告诉我的女儿，可别闹 恋爱，对她说过一千遍爱情完全是愚蠢而且邪恶的。那个狡猾的丫头还假 装把我这话听进去了，也表示讨厌一切和肉欲有关的东西。可是最后呢， 却从三楼的窗口跑掉了一一老实说，我对她有点起了疑心，所以才把她牢 牢锁在房里，打算第二天早上就把她嫁给我中意的那个男人。可是只差上 几个小时，这番希望竟然被她破坏了，她跑到她自己看中的那个男人那里 去了。他们一点儿也没耽搁，因为不出一个钟头两个人就成了亲，睡在一 起了。可是我要让他们在那一个钟头里干的事给他们带来最坏的后果。对 我来说，他们尽可以一道去挨饿、讨饭或偷窃。我绝不给他们一个小 钱。”他说到这里，琼斯马上跳起来，大声说："实在对不起，您最好走 开。""得啦，得啦，朋友，"教友会会员说，"别这么难过了。你看世上不 幸的不单是你一个呢！皿我知道世上有疯子、傻瓜和坏蛋，”琼斯大声 说，"但是听我一句忠告：派人把你的女儿和女婿都接回家来吧。既然你假 装很爱自己的女儿，那么就不要让你自己成为使她痛苦的唯一原因。""派 人把她和那个女婿接回来？"教友会会员大声嚷道，"那还不如把世上我最 大的两个仇人找回来呢。""要是那样，"琼斯说，"就请回家或者到你乐意 去的地方去吧，我不愿和你这种人谈下去了。""好吧，朋友，"教友会会员 说，"我也决不是非要和谁谈下去不可。"他一面说，一面把手插进衣袋去 掏钱，但是琼斯使勤把他推出门去。
教友会会员的谈话使琼斯十分激动，谈的时候他的一双眼睛直直地盯 着说话的人。教友会会员也注意到了这一点。再加上琼斯的其他动作，就 使得这位戴宽边帽子的四老实人以为和他交谈的这个人发了神经。因此，他 不但没生琼斯的气，还对他的不幸表示起同情来。于是，就把这意思告诉 了客栈老板，要他好生招呼琼斯，殷勤款待他。
"用不着对他那么客气，"老板说。"尽管他穿着镶花边的坎肩，他好像 比我高贵不到哪里。只不过是教区上一个孤苦伶仃的私生子，在离这儿三 十哩的一位大乡绅家里抚养大的。如今被赶出大门一一准不是为了什么好 事。我要把他撵走，越快越好。要是我得赔上店钱，那么也是赔得越早， 赔得越少。不到一年前我就丢过一把银汤匙。”
"你讲什么教区上的私生子，罗宾？"教友会会员问，"你一定认错人 了。”
"决没认错，"罗宾回答说，"替他带路的那个人晓得他的老底子，是他 告诉我的。"那个向导确实一走进厨房靠炉灶坐下，就把他所晓得和听说过 的关于琼斯的一切，向大家讲了。
那个教友会会员一听到那家伙千真万确地说出琼斯的出身和窘境，他 的一腔同情立刻就烟消云散了。这个朴实的老实人带着一肚子气转回家 去，他的震怒就好似堂堂一位公爵受到这种人的冒犯一般。
客栈老板对他这位旅客也怀着同样的憎恶。所以当琼斯拉铃吩咐替他 预备寝处的时候，老板说没有床铺。罗宾除了看不起这位旅客低微的身 份，还十分担心琼斯会伺机偷盗。其实，他这些担忧大可不必，因为他那 细心的婆娘和女儿早已把一切动产拿个精光。但是这位老板生性多疑，尤 其在丢了那把汤匙以后。总之，他脑子里充满了被抢劫的恐怖，倒忘记了 他根本没什么可丢，大可高枕无忧。
琼斯晓得弄不到床铺睡觉，就心满意足地蜷卧在一把灯心草编的大椅 子上。前几天，在华丽的寝室里总和他躲躲藏藏的睡眠，这时却惠然光 临，到这陋室里来拜访他了。
至于客栈老板，他倒由于恐惧而不能入睡。后来索性回到炉灶旁边， 以便隔着通往房间（或者还不如说一个洞穴）那扇唯一的门来监视坐在那 里的琼斯。至于那间屋子的窗口，任何比猫大的动物都休想从那里逃出 去。
第十一章
一队士兵的奇遇
客栈老板面对房间的门坐了下来，决计要死守上一整宵。那个向导和 另一个汉子也陪了他好半天，虽然他们既不晓得老板疑心些什么，他们自 己也就没起什么怀疑。最后，促使他们在那里守望的真正动机，就是那味 甘性烈的啤酒本身，却结束了他们的守望。他们灌下很多酒以后，先是大 吵大闹，后来就沉沉入睡了。
但是酒并不能驱除罗宾的恐怖感。他依旧坐在椅子上，睁大了眼睛死 死盯着通往琼斯先生那个房间的内，直到猛地听到雷般的敲门声，他才只 好站起来去开门。门刚一打开，厨房里立刻就挤满了穿红色制服的先生 们。他们乱哄哄地一齐朝他冲来，真好像要把他这座小堡垒猛攻下来一 般。
客人们要酒要得很急。客栈老板这时不得不离开他守望的岗位来替这 批旅客预备啤酒。当他第二次或是第三次从地窖里走回房间时，看到琼斯 先生也和那簇士兵一道站在炉火前了。这原不足为奇：来了这么一大批好 伙伴，除非那些睡得只有最后的号筒才唤得醒的人四，谁也睡不下去了。
这批客人好好解了渴以后，少不得要来会钞了。这种场合往往会在下 层绅士中间引起纠纷和不满。在按照每人喝的多少来分摊酒款时，要想算 得分毫不差是很难的。当前，这种困难就出现了，而且情况更不好办一 些，因为有几位先生喝完头一杯以后，根本忘记付自己那份酒款就匆匆开 拔了。
现在引起了一场剧烈的争执。可以说，他们每句话都是在赌咒，因为 起码一半用的都是赌咒字眼。这队士兵一齐开口，你一句我一句，个个都 像是尽量在想法把自己应付的那份酒钱减少一些，看来最可能的结局是酒 账大部分得落到老板头上，或者甚至全部赖了账一一这两者其实差别是不 大的。
这时候，琼斯先生正和一位军士攀谈着，那位军官完全没卷入这场争 执，因为根据由来已久的习惯，他向来是享有免予付账的特权的。
争执越来越激烈，似乎非要诉诸武力不可了，这当儿，琼斯走上前 去，宣布酒账他愿意一人担负一一其实，一共才三先令四便士。这样，一 切纷扰马上平息下来。
琼斯这一举赢得了全体士兵的感激和赞扬。房间里响起了"体面"，"高 贵”、"可敬的绅士"一类字眼，甚至客栈老板对琼斯也有了好感，几乎不相 信向导的那套话了。
军士告诉琼斯先生说，他们正在开拔去打叛军，多半会归威名显赫的 昆布兰公爵也］指挥。读者由此也可以看出（关于这一点，我们觉得以前没有 提出的必要）这正是新近这场叛乱闹得最紧张的时候，匪军已经侵入英格 兰，显然是要和王家的军队决一死战，以便向首都进袭。
琼斯的性格里颇有几分豪迈。而且他十分希望代表自由和新教的这一 方取得胜利。琼斯在当前的处境下，原是可以做出更加放荡不羁的事来 的，因此，他想以志愿兵身份加入这支出征讨伐的队伍也就不足为奇了。
这位指挥官一听到琼斯有这种好念头，就竭力怂恿，促成其事。他把 琼斯这个崇高的志愿大声宣布出来，全队官兵听了一致表示热烈欢迎，齐 声喊着："愿上帝保佑国王乔治和您的荣誉！"随后又起了许多誓，说："我 们要同您并肩作战，直到流尽最后一滴血。”
在客栈里喝了一宵酒的那位先生，经一名伍长放在他手中的宣传品所 说服，也参加了这支讨伐军。这时，琼斯先生的衣箱已经装到行李车上。 在队伍准备开拔的当儿，忽然那个向导走到琼斯跟前说："先生，请您想想 看，我的马通宵都在伺候着您，我们又绕了好长一段路。"琼斯听到这个无 耻的要求，十分惊讶，就向士兵弟兄们讲明事实真相，弟兄们异口同声地 责备向导不该向一位绅士这么勒索。有的士兵认为应当把他四马攒蹄捆起 来，有的说应当让他饱尝一顿夹鞭刑㈤。那军士朝向导晃了晃手杖，狠狠地 赌咒说，可惜向导不属于他的部下，不然的话，非好好惩治他一下不可。
可是琼斯觉得吓唬那个向导一下就行了。他和这群新伙伴动身走了， 丢下那个向导，随他去用诅咒骂街来出气。客栈老板也帮腔说："唉，唉， 这倒真是个地道货。哼，好个体面绅士，真是块当兵的料！他确实配穿镶 花边的坎肩哩。那句老话说得一点儿也不假：闪闪发光的并不都是金子。 谢天谢地，他总算出了我这客栈的大门。”
整整一天，那军士都和这年轻士兵一道前进。军士是个油嘴滑舌的家 伙。他对琼斯讲了许多他在战场上有趣的见闻。其实，他从来也没打过 仗，因为他是新近才入伍的，靠着一套灵巧机警逢迎上司的本事，提升为 执戟兵。他的主要长处是招募新兵，这方面他的本领确实高超。
行军途中，士兵们说说笑笑，热闹非常。他们回忆着头天晚上宿营时 候的许多趣事，每个人都毫无顾忌地跟长官们开着玩笑，有些话说得很粗 鄙，甚至近乎侮辱。这情景使我们的主人公想起书中记载的希腊、罗马人 的习惯：在某些节日或举行重大典礼的时候，奴隶们享有任意议论主子的 自由。
由两连步兵组成的这支队伍这时来到他们当晚宿营的地点。军士就向 指挥这支队伍的中尉报告说，半路上他们又募了两名新兵：一个体格再健 壮不过（指通宵饮酒的那人），他身高将近六叭，生得匀称，四肢结实； 另一个（指琼斯）蛮可以编到后备队里去。
两个新兵就被带到指挥官跟前。他先审视了一下那个身高六叭的汉子 （因为他是头一个被引见的），然后才来端详琼斯。中尉一见到他就不禁 感到有些奇怪，因为琼斯不但衣冠楚楚，举止文雅，而且神色之间还有在 下等人身上不常见、在上等人身上也不一定能找到的那种引人注目的尊 严。
"先生，"中尉说，"军士向我报告说，您想参加我所指挥的这支军队。 如果是这样的话，那么对于一位愿意拿起武器为这支军队大增光荣的先 生，我们是衷心表示欢迎的。”
琼斯回答说：他从没说他要正式入伍，不过他对这次出兵作战的光荣 使命十分拥护，他很愿意以一名志愿兵的身份来效劳。最后他还恭维了中 尉几句，表示十分愿意充当他的部下。
中尉也回了几句客气话，夸奖琼斯英勇果断，和他握手，并且邀琼斯 和他以及其他军官共进晚餐。
第十二章
一群军官的奇遇
前一章里提过的那位指挥这支队伍的中尉，现在已年近六十了。他年 纪很轻的时候就入了伍，曾经在坦尼尔战役里当过旗手，受了两次伤，立 下显赫的战功。战役结束后，马尔勃罗公爵㈤立即把他提升为中尉。
从那以后，将近四十年来他一直停留在这个官阶上。在这期间，他眼 睁睁看到许多人升作他的上司，如今他只好忍辱含垢地受这些年轻后生们 的指挥一一而当这位中尉刚入伍的时候，这些后生的老子还在吃奶呢。
他的官运不济不仅是由于他朝里乏人，还由于他不幸开罪了多年来一 直指挥着他这个联队的上校。然而使上校跟他结下这么难解难分的怨仇 的，并不是因为他缺乏才能、疏于职守或是他本人的任何差错，而是完全 怪他那位极其美貌的妻子应付不当：尽管她非常爱自己的丈夫，但是她却 不肯答应给上校向她索取的某种好处来换取丈夫的晋级。
尤其不幸的是：尽管这位可怜的中尉身受上校对他的敌意之害，自己 却既不晓得，也没料到上校对他会怀有敌意，因为他不觉得自己曾经做过 什么足以引起旁人敌视的事。他的妻子深怕丈夫由于爱护自己的荣誉而可 能惹起争端，宁愿满足于保全自己的节操，而不去享受在征服男人方面获 得的胜利。
这位不幸的中尉（我想可以这么称呼他吧）不但长于军务，而且还有 许多旁的优点：他笃信宗教，为人诚实可靠，并且心肠极好。他带兵得 法，所以不但他那一连士兵，就是整个联队对他也是十分敬重和爱戴的。
同他一道行军的还有一位法国籍的中尉。此人久离祖国，把法国话差 不多全忘光了，而侨居英国的日子又还不够长久，没学会英国话；因此， 实际上他哪国话也说不利索，在极普通的场合也只能勉强让人听懂他的大 意。另外还有两名旗手，都是年轻小伙子，一个是在律师家里抚养大的， 另一个是某贵族府上管家的老婆的儿子。
刚吃完饭，琼斯就把行军途中士兵之间的一些趣闻说给大家听。他 说："不管大家怎样吵吵闹闹，可是一旦跟敌人交起手来，我敢起誓他们一 定会像希腊人而不是像特洛伊人那样行动。"一个旗手说："希腊人和特洛 伊人！他们究竟是什么人呀？全欧洲的军队我都听说过，可就没听说过这 两种。”
"诺塞顿先生，不要装得什么都不知道啦，"那位可敬的中尉说，"也许 您从来没读过蒲伯翻译的荷马，但我想您总该听说过希腊人和特洛伊人。 这位先生这么一谈，倒使我记起荷马曾经把特洛伊的队伍比作嘎嘎叫着的 鹅群醐，大大称赞了希腊人的庄严肃穆。我敢说，这位志愿兵的见解很有道 理。”
"对，俺清楚地记得，"那个法籍中尉说，"俺在学堂里念过，就是达西 尔夫人图那本。希腊人，特洛伊人，为了一个女人他们打仗一一是的，是 的，俺全念过。”
"去他妈的荷姆，"诺塞顿说，"到如今我的屁股上还留着它的伤疤呢。 咱们联队里的托马斯口袋里总揣着本荷姆的书，哪天给我抓到，一定把它 烧掉。还有那个考德留斯图，婊子养的，为他我也没少挨揍。”
"那么，诺塞顿先生，您上过学啊？”中尉说。
"妈的，可不是嘛，"他回答说，"我那父亲真他妈见鬼，硬要把我送进 学堂去，老头子满心想叫我当个牧师。我心里说，老混账，我决不能叫你 称心，鬼才会把你这套话听进去呢。还有咱们联队的杰米•奥利佛，他也差 点儿当上了臭牧师，那可就太可惜啦。我敢说，天下男子再没比他漂亮的 了。可是杰米对他那个老混账比我来得更带勤儿，他干脆给他来个既不会 写，也一字不识。”
"您可把您这位朋友形容得太好了，"中尉说，"而且，我相信也没冤枉 他。不过，诺塞顿先生，我劝您还是改掉那个既愚蠢又不正经的骂骂咧咧 的习惯更好些。要是您以为这么做就会显得俏皮或是有礼貌，我敢说，您 是大错特错啦。我还希望您听我的劝告，以后不要再辱骂牧师。对于干任 何一种职业的人加以侮蔑和指责总是不公道的；要是用到担任圣职的人们 身上，就尤其不该了，因为辱骂从事这种职业的人就等于辱骂他们所担任 的职务本身。请您自己评评理：为了保卫新教而去作战的人竟有这种行 径，这是多么不相称呀。”
阿德里先生（这是另外那个旗手的名字）一直坐在那儿，用鞋后跟打 拍子，嘴里哼着小调，似乎没理会他们的谈话。这时他说："0 , Monsieur，on ne parle pas de la religion dans la guerre.”囹“说得 好，杰克，”诺塞顿嚷着，"要是la religion㈣是唯一的大事，那就叫牧师代 替我去打仗好啦。”
"诸位先生，"琼斯说，"我不晓得你们的高见怎样，不过，我认为在一 个人可以献身的事业中，再没有比宗教更高贵的了。而且从我读过的一些 历史著作中，我理会到：再没有比受到宗教热情启发的士兵打仗打得更英 勇的了。至于我自己，尽管我希望，我爱我的国王和祖国不下于任何人， 可是促使我在这次讨伐中成为一名志愿兵的动力，主要来自捍卫新教的利 益 "
这时，诺塞顿就朝阿德里	了 眼，偷偷在他耳边说："开
这个小贼头的玩笑，阿德里，开他的玩笑！"然后掉过身来对琼斯说："先 生，我真高兴您到我们联队来当志愿兵。有朝一日咱们联队里那位牧师万 一多饮了两杯的话，我看您大可以代替他的职务。我想，您一定是进过大 学的，您可以赏光，告诉我您念的是哪个学院吗？"
"先生，"琼斯说，"我不但没上过大学，我甚至比您还行，因为我从来 就没进过学堂。”
"我只是从您那渊博的知识来猜测的，"旗手嚷道。琼斯回答说："啊， 先生，没上过学的人可以有些知识，正如上过学的人也可以一无所知一 样。”
"说得好，年轻的志愿兵，"中尉大声说，"诺塞顿，您最好别再跟这位 胡缠了，您未必是他的对手。”
诺塞顿听了琼斯挖苦他的话，心里很不高兴，然而又还不能为这就打 琼斯一下，或者骂他一声浑蛋、痞子，他当时唯一想到的对答就是这些 了。因此，他只好暂不吭声，心里拿定主意一有机会就用侮辱来报复他的 挖苦。
现在该轮到琼斯先生来举杯祝酒了。他禁不住提起了亲爱的苏菲亚的 名字，尤其当前他更无所顾忌，因为他料想在座的谁也不会猜得出他说的 是谁。
可是主持祝酒的那位中尉表示光提苏菲亚这个名字不够，还得说出她 的姓来。琼斯犹豫了一阵，然后就说：苏菲亚•魏斯顿小姐。旗手诺塞顿当 众声言，除非有人替这个姑娘作证，不然的话，轮到他的时候他可不能祝 酒。"我晓得一个叫苏菲•魏斯顿的，巴思城的小伙子有一半都跟她睡过觉。 说不定就是同一个女人哩。"琼斯十分郑重地向他保证不是那个女人，并且
肯定他心目中所指的年轻小姐是一位大家闺秀。"对，对，”那个旗手 说，"就是她，没错儿。妈的，就是那个娘儿们。我情愿赌半打葡萄酒：咱 们联队的托姆•弗伦奇随便到桥街的哪家酒馆去，都能把她喊来陪客。"接 着，他就一丝不差地形容起她的模样来（因为他看见过这位姑娘和她的姑 妈同行）。末了，还说："她老子在萨默塞特郡有很大一座庄园。”
情人们一点也受不住旁人拿他们情侣的名字开玩笑。尽管琼斯性格既 多情又英勇果敢，听了这种诽谤本应立刻动怒，然而他并没这样。老实 说，他对这种玩笑还颇生疏，乍听起来不摸头脑，好半天都以为诺塞顿先 生弄错了人。这时，他才掉过身来，神色庄重地对旗手说："先生，请您找 个旁的题目来开玩笑吧。说老实话，我是决不允许人拿这位小姐的名声开 玩笑的。皿开玩笑！ ”那个人嚷道，"妈的，我一辈子从没这么一本正经 过。咱们联队的托姆-弗伦奇在巴思把这个姑娘和她的姑妈都弄到手 了。""那么我就也一本正经地告诉你，"琼斯大声说，"你是个天下最无耻 的流氓。”
这话刚说完，旗手就抄起一只瓶子，随着一声咒骂朝琼斯的脑袋掼 去，打在右鬓骨上边一点，人立刻就倒在地上了。
胜利者看到敌人已经一动不动地躺在他跟前，鲜血从伤口大量涌出， 就想退出已经没有什么光荣可图的战场，可是中尉出面干预了。他走到门 口，迎头拦住旗手的去路。
诺塞顿一再恳求中尉放他走，竭力说他留下来后果会多么不好，而且 反问中尉说，除了揍他一下还有什么旁的办法。"真见鬼，"他说，"我不过 是跟这小子开个玩笑。我从来也不曾听说过魏斯顿小姐的什么坏话。""不 曾听说过吗？”中尉说，"那么不管是由于你开了这种玩笑也罢，使用了这 种武器也罢，都该把你绞死。先生，你被捕了，在适当的卫兵来押解你以 前，不许你动。”
尽管旗手勇气十足，竟把我们可怜的主人公打倒在地，中尉的威望却 完全可以将他制服。即使当时诺塞顿身上带着军刀，他也未必敢跟中尉动 武，何况所有的军刀都挂在墙上，而且争吵一开始，就给那位法籍中尉收 了起来。这样一来，诺塞顿先生只得听候处理了。
那位法籍绅士和阿德里先生就遵照指挥官的意思把琼斯的身子抬起 来，可是他们看到他（即使还没咽气）已奄奄一息，就又把他放了下来。 阿德里还满口咒骂着琼斯，因为琼斯的鲜血把他的背心都浸透了。那位法
国人则声明说："死了的英国人俺不碰。俺听说英国法律的有：谁最后碰过 那死人，谁上绞刑架。”
好中尉走到门口拉了拉铃，茶房立刻走来。中尉派他去叫一排佩带枪 支的士兵和一名外科医生来。这个吩咐，再加上茶房出去向人一说他目睹 的情景，房里不但立刻出现了一排士兵，并且还引来了客栈老板、他的妻 子和仆人。总之，当时在客栈里的人都来了。
我没法把事情的每一细节以及每个人当场说的话都写下来，除非我有 四十支笔，并且能够同时用它们来记录一切。因此，只能让读者知道一下 其中最主要的情节，其余的恕我只好从略。
他们首先把诺塞顿看押起来。中尉把他交给由一名伍长率领的六名士 兵，他们把诺塞顿从他很乐意离开的地方押到一个他很不乐意去的地方。 老实说，人的欲望真是古怪，诺塞顿这个小伙子刚刚取得了上述的光荣， 他就恨不得躲到天涯海角去，最好永远也听不到这番壮举给他带来的盛 誉。
使我们感到困惑不解，同时，可能也会使读者感到惊奇的是，这位可 敬的好中尉把他的心思主要用于看押肇事者，却不甚关心保全伤者的性 命。我们所以提到这一点，倒不是想来解释这个奇怪的行为，而是为了防 止日后某位批评家夸口，说他发觉这个现象不可思议。希望那些先生们晓 得，我们同样看得出人类行为中这种怪诞之处，不过我们的职责在于把事 情如实地写出，然后由明智而渊博的读者拿我们所叙述的去跟自然那本书 核对一一我们这部作品的每一段都是从自然那部巨著上抄录下来的，尽管 我们没处处注明所根据的确切页码。
这时赶来的一批人却是另一种做法，他们对旗手其人暂时并无兴趣， 要等将来看到他摆出一副更加引人入胜的姿态时再说。眼下，他们都全神 贯注在地上那个血淋淋的人身上，他们把他扶到椅子上直坐起来，不一会 儿就发现还有生命和活动的迹象。一看到这情况（最初大家都断定琼斯早 已一命呜呼了），他们就一齐替他医治起来一一当时没有大夫在场，所以 每个人都当起大夫来了。
房里的人异口同声都主张给他放血，可是不幸身边找不到人来施行这 种手术。于是，大家一齐嚷着："叫理发匠来！"然而谁也不肯动步。人们 又提出该用几种兴奋剂，可也只开口不动手。最后还是客栈老板喊人送来 一杯烈性啤酒和一片烤面包，他说，这是英国最好的一种兴奋剂。
这件事情发生的时候，主要帮忙的，其实也是唯一帮了点忙的，或者 看来是帮了点忙的，是客栈的那位老板娘。她剪下自己的一绺头发，按到 琼斯的伤口上，把血止住，然后又亲手替他搓揉太阳穴。她非常瞧不起她 丈夫用啤酒来医治的办法，却吩咐她的一个女仆到她自己的壁橱里去拿一 瓶白兰地来。一拿到酒，她就劝琼斯（这时他的神志刚刚恢复过来）大大 喝上一口。
接着，外科医生来了。他一看到伤势就连连摇头，责备他们做得全不 对。他吩咐病人立刻躺到床上去。我们也认为应该让他好好休养一下，所 以本章就此结束。
第十三章
客栈老板娘的高谈阔论，外科大夫的渊博学识，以及可敏的中尉鉴 别人品的实在本领
当他们把打伤的人抬到床上，这个事故在客栈里引起的慌乱又安定下 来之后，老板娘就对指挥官说："老爷，恐怕这小伙子对长官准是有失敬的 地方，他就是死了，我看也是活该。说真的，下等人要是跟绅士们在一起 的时候，他们应该懂得贵贱尊卑。可是正像我的前夫经常说的，下等人大 部分都是不知分寸的。从我来说，我是决不让下等人硬挤进绅士们中间去 的。不过我一直以为他也是个军官，后来听军士说起，我才知道他原来是 个新兵。”
"老板娘，”中尉说，"你完全弄错啦。这位年轻人举止十分端正，我相 信从人品来说要比侮辱他的那个旗手高贵多了。万一这个年轻人死了，最 后悔的将是动手打他的那个人。因为我们联队一定要把那个捣乱鬼，给军 队丢脸的那个败类除掉。老板娘，假若他逃出法网，那就唯我是问。”
"唉，我的天！"老板娘说，"谁会想到呢！我相信老爷一定会主持公道 的。说真的，对每一个人都该这样才对。上等人也不能杀了穷人就没事 了。穷人的命也是命呀。”
"其实，老板娘，"中尉说，"你委屈了这位志愿兵，我可以赌誓，他的 身份要比那个军官来得高贵。”
"对啦！"老板娘说，"是啊，这话一点儿也不差。我的前夫是个聪明 人，他就经常说，人不可以貌相。不，也许他的样子原来是挺高贵的，不 过我看到他的时候，他早已遍身是血啦。谁会想到呢！说不定是一位失恋 的少爷。天哪，万一他真的死了，他爹妈该多么难过呀。干这种事的那个 缺德家伙一定是着了魔。真的，正像老爷刚才说的，是个给军队丢脸的败 类，因为我看到的军官老爷们大半都跟他两样。看起来他们同普通人一样 也是不赞成杀害好人的。当然，正像我的前夫所说，这里指的只是太平年 月。真要是打起仗来，自然就得杀人喽，那可就怪不得他们啦。在战场 上，他们杀得越多越好。但愿他们把所有娘胎里生下的男人都斩尽杀绝。”
"哎呀，老板娘，"中尉笑了笑说，"斩尽杀绝也未免太残忍了吧。”
"老爷，一点儿也算不得残忍，"她回答说，"我这人一点儿也不残忍。 这话只是针对敌人说的，那没什么害处。咱们自然都盼着敌人死掉，这样
战争才好结束，捐税才好减少呀。捐税压得我们真受不了。您瞧，光窗户 税四就得交四十多个先令一一凡是能堵上的窗户，我们全堵上啦，屋里黑漆 漆的几乎没一点亮光。我对那个收税的官儿说：喂，你们也该对我们开开 恩啦，我们对得起政府。我敢说这句话，因为我们交的税钱足够堆成山 了。可是我时常想：政府对我们远不如对那些一个铜板也不交的人那么领 情。唉，世道就是这样啊！ ”
她正这么滔滔不绝地讲着的当儿，外科大夫进屋来了。中尉立即向他 打听病人的情况，他只是回答说："总比如果到这时还没把我请来要强些； 即使这样，倘若能再早点请我来，就会更好一些。""大夫，”中尉说，"我 希望他的头盖骨没打碎吧哼，"医生大声说，"打碎骨头并不总是危险 的症状。瘀血和骨裂往往会比打碎骨头带来更可怕的征兆，对生命有更大 的威胁。对医学一窍不通的人总以为只要骨头没打碎，一切就平安无事 了。可是我宁愿看到一个病人的头盖骨破成碎片，也不愿意遇到像我所遇 到的一些瘀血症状。""我希望这个病人没有这种症状，"中尉说。"症状的 出现并不总是有规律和一成不变的，"外科大夫说，"我就遇到过一些症状 早晨显得十分严重，中午变得大有起色，夜晚却又严重起来了。至于伤 口，这句话说得确实有道理：Nemo repente fuit turpissimus。四记得有 一回人家请我去给一个人治病，他的胫骨严重挫伤，因而表皮划破，造成 大量出血；同时，内膜扯裂，os——也就是骨头，从vulnus——也就是伤 处的缝隙那儿露出来，看得十分清楚。病人这时还有些发热性谵妄（因为 脉搏跳得很快，说明出血过多），我担心马上会发生坏疽现象。为了避免 这个情况，我在病人左臂上开了个大口子，抽出二十盎司血。我本以为那 血一定像胶一般黏糊糊的，要不就凝固起来，像肋膜炎的患者那样；不料 那血却是鲜红色的，稠度也和健康人的血一样。于是，我又在伤处施行热 敷，效果异常良好。敷了三四次之后，伤口开始流出脓来，那就是说，愈 合……不过，也许我没把话说得十分清楚吧？""真的，我一个字儿也没听 懂，"中尉回答说。"那么，长官，"外科大夫说，"我也不再唠叨下去啦。 总之一句话，不出六个星期，那位病人就能像胫骨没有挫伤以前那么行动 自如了。""大夫，”中尉说，"我只希望您费心告诉我一声，这位年轻绅士 不幸受的伤会不会引起生命危险长官，"外科大夫回答说，"刚治疗一 次就断言有没有生命危险，那就未免太缺乏根据，太不明智了。凡是人， 迟早都要死亡的。在医疗过程中经常会发生一些症状，便是医界泰斗也没
法逆料。""不过您觉得他的情况危险吗？”中尉问道。"危险！”外科医生大 声说，"当然危险。便是最健康的人，哪个又敢说他没有危险呢？何况受了 这么重伤的人，怎么能说他没有危险呢？目前我能说的只是请我来是好 的，能够再早些请我来就会更好。明天早晨我再来看看。这期间，一定要 让他静养，多给他些稀粥喝。皿您让不让他喝点奶子酒？"老板娘问 道。"奶子酒，可以，可以，"大夫大声说，"可是只能少量的。""也可以给 他点鸡汤吗？”她又补了一句。"可以，可以，"大夫说，"鸡汤很好。""允 许我给他做点儿肉冻吗？”老板娘问道。"可以，可以，"大夫说，"肉冻吃 了对伤口有好处，它帮助收口。"亏了她没把肉汤或浓酱汁也提出来，不然 的话，大夫为了怕丢掉这家客栈的生意，也会一律答应下来的。
大夫刚一走掉，老板娘就对中尉大夸他的名望。不过中尉刚刚结识这 位大夫，对他的医道远没有好心的老板娘以及她的左邻右舍那么钦佩。这 些人钦佩他也许是有道理的，因为尽管这位大夫有点儿好卖弄，然而他可 能是个很有本事的外科大夫。
中尉从外科大夫渊博的谈话中了解到琼斯先生的伤势危殆，立刻就下 令对诺塞顿先生严加看押，打算第二天早晨亲自把他解到保安官那里，队 伍则派那位法籍中尉率领，先开到格洛斯特去，尽管任何一种语言他都不 会说、写或读，他却是位好军官。
傍晚，这位指挥官派人给琼斯先生捎来个口信，说如果他不嫌打扰的 话，中尉想来看望他一下。琼斯对这种关注表示十分感激，于是，中尉就 来到他的房间，发现这位受伤者的情况要比他料想的好得多。不但这样， 琼斯还对这位朋友说，倘若不是大夫特别吩咐，他一定老早就起来了，因 为他觉得自己康复得已经和平日一样了；除去头上打伤的那一半痛得厉害 以外，伤势对他没有什么旁的影响。
"如果情况真是像你想的那么好，我真是高兴极了，"中尉说，"那样， 你就马上可以去惩治那个欺侮你的人了。因为一件纠纷要是到了没法和解 的地步，比如你们这场吵架，那就越早些跟他算清账越好。不过，我恐怕 你的身子恢复的程度还没你想象的那么好，那对方可就占了很大的优势。”
"要是您同意的话，我愿意试试看，"琼斯回答说，"请把您的军刀借我 用一用，我自己的不在身边。”
"好孩子，我的军刀任凭你使用，"中尉吻了吻他，大声说，"你真是个 英勇的小伙子，对你这种精神我很钦佩。不过我担心你的气力还不够；挨
了这么沉重的一击，流了这么多血，气力自然会亏损许多。你躺着的时候 也许不觉得，可是交起手来，一两个回合以后你就会感到了。我不同意你 今天晚上就和他干，可是我希望队伍开拔以后，过不几天你就能追赶上我 们。我用人格向你担保，伤害你的那个人一定得接受同你决斗的挑战，不 然的话，他就休想留在我们的联队里。”
"我愿意今天晚上就能得出个结果来，"琼斯说，"既然您这么说了，我 就再也忍耐不下去了。”
"可别这么想，"中尉说，"迟几天也没什么关系。名誉上受的伤跟身上 受的伤不一样，迟一点治疗不会有什么害处。过一个星期再决斗跟马上决 斗没什么两样。”
"不过，万一我这伤势厉害起来，"琼斯说，"以至于送了命呢？"
"那样你就根本不需要挽回名誉了。"中尉说，"我会为你的人品辩护， 一定向世人证明：如果你恢复了健康，你原是决定要采取正当行动的。”
"可是这种迟延仍然使我不安，"琼斯回答说，"您是军人，我几乎不敢 对您提起；尽管我一直是个孟浪的小伙子，然而在严肃的时刻，在内心深 处实际上我还是个基督教徒。”
"你可以相信我同样是个基督教徒，"军官说，"而且我对宗教十分热 忱，所以吃饭的时候听到你要捍卫宗教的利益，我非常高兴。不过，年轻 人，如今你对于在人前宣布自己的信仰感到胆怯，那我倒有点儿生你的气 了。”
"可是对于任何一个真正的基督教徒说来，"琼斯大声说，"违背上帝的 戒律，对人怀着怨恨，那该是多么可怕啊！我怎么能在卧床养病的时候这 样做呢？我胸中存着这种对自己不利的东西，在末日审判的时候，我怎么 对上帝交待呢？"
"我相信确实有这么一条戒律，"中尉大声说，"然而一个爱护名誉的人 是没法遵守它的；而你要是想当个军人，就必须爱惜名誉。记得一回跟联 队的牧师饮潘趣酒巡的时候，我曾向他提出这个问题，他也承认这很难解 决。不过他希望在这方面对军人可以格外通融一些。说真的，我们也应该 抱这种希望，因为失掉了名誉，谁还能活下去呢？不，不，好孩子，活着 一天就要做个好基督教徒，同时也要做个爱护名誉的人，决不容忍任何人 的侮辱。世界上所有的书籍，所有的牧师也不能说服我这一点。我很爱我 的宗教，但是我更爱我的名誉。那段经文措辞上一定有点毛病，要不就是
翻译走了样，再不就是解释错了一一反正总是有些不对头。我们只好冒一 冒险，因为无论如何我们也得保存自己的名誉。所以今天晚上还是先好好 安歇吧，我一定会给你一个伸张正义的机会的。"说到这里，他热烈地吻了 吻琼斯，和他握了握手就告辞了。
尽管中尉认为自己这席话头头是道，然而他并没完全说服他这位朋 友。琼斯心里左思右想，来回翻腾，终于做出一个决定。详情如何，请看 下一章便见分晓。
第十四章
这是最可怕的一章，一般读者都不宜在夜间来读，尤其不可在无人 做伴时去读
琼斯胃口很好，他喝下一大盘清炖鸡汤一一或者还不如说，清炖公鸡 汤。其实，就是再把炖汤的那只公鸡饶上，外加一磅火腿他也蛮吃得下。 如今，觉得自己气力不短，精神不差，就决计下床去寻找他的仇人。
他先派人把那个军士找来一一在这些军人先生们中间，琼斯头一个结 识的就是此人。但是那位可敬的军官偏偏喝个酩酊大醉，早就歪倒在长枕 上了。他鼻孔里打着如雷的呼噜，要把足以压倒那呼噜的声音送进他的耳 里，确实颇为不易。
可是琼斯非要见他不可，一个大嗓门儿的茶房终于想办法把他叫醒 了，把话传给他。军士一听懂他的话，立刻就爬了起来。他压根儿就没脱 衣服，所以马上就看望琼斯来了。这位执戟兵本人是极爱名誉的，也曾杀 过他的决斗对手。其实，如果琼斯把自己的意图告诉这位军士也不会出什 么差池，他一定会忠实地替琼斯保守这个秘密的一一就像对待泄漏出去也 领不到赏金的任何秘密一样。不过，琼斯想最好还是不让他晓得的好。两 人相识不久，琼斯对军士这些美德究竟并不深知，他这种机警是出于谨 慎，因而也是值得我们称道的。
于是，他对军士说，既然入了伍，可是到如今他还不具备一个军人必 不可少的工具，即是说，一把军刀，自己未免觉得太难堪。随后又说，如 果军士能弄一把来，他是感激不尽的。"军刀该值多少钱，我一定照 付，"琼斯说，"我也不一定非要银柄的不可，只要刀刃锋利，军人佩带着 合适就行。”
军士完全清楚发生的事，而且也听说琼斯的伤势危殆，深更半夜听到 这个受重伤的人向他提出这样一个要求，心里就断定琼斯准是神志不清。 由于他富于机智（按照这个字的通常含义来理解），就想利用病人的这点 雅兴占点便宜。"先生，"他说，"这件事我想我可以替您效劳。我自己就有 一把非常好的刀子。它不是银柄的，那个，正像您所说，不适于军人佩 带，不过也还看得过去；刀刃是欧洲出产的上等货。这刀刃……这刀 刃……总之一句话，我马上拿给您，您自己亲眼看看，亲手试试吧。您的 伤养得这么好了，我真是打心坎里高兴。”
他立刻把军刀取来，递给琼斯。琼斯接到手就把它拔出来。他对军士 说了声很合用，要他说个价钱。
这时，军士就吹嘘起他的货物了。他说(不，他是满口赌着誓)："这 把刀是在德廷根四战役中从一名地位很高的法国军官手里缴获来的。我先照 他的脑袋揍了一下，然后亲手从他腰间夺下了这把刀。它原是金柄的，我 把它卖给本国一位上流先生了。您晓得，专有一种人把刀柄看得比刀刃还 重。”
这时，琼斯把他的话打住，要他说个价钱。军士以为琼斯完全神志不 清，眼看就要一命呜呼了，他怕价钱开低了对不起自己的老婆孩子。他犹 豫了一下，提出要二十基尼，并且发誓说，便是自己的亲弟兄，少一个铜 板也不卖。
“二+基尼！"琼斯十分惊讶地说，"你一定是以为我发了疯，要不就是 -辈子没见过一把刀。说得倒好，二+基尼！我绝没料到你会企图来骗 我。喏，把刀拿去一一不，让我想想看，先放在我这里，明天早晨我把它 拿给你的上级看看，并让他也听听你向我要的价钱。”
正如我们说的，这位军士富于机智(in sensu proedicto昭)，这时 他清清楚楚地看出琼斯的病情并不像他所设想的那样严重，于是，就装作 同对方一般惊讶地说："先生，我敢说决没敲您的竹杠。并且您要晓得，我 只有这么一把刀；万一给我的上司发现我没有了军刀，还会怪我的。说实 在的，要把我冒的这种风险考虑进去，二十先令怎么也不能说是要得太多 吧！ ”
“二+先令！"琼斯嚷道，"你刚才向我讨的是二十基尼！""怎么？"军 士嚷道，"一定是您听错啦，要不就是我说错啦一一我的确还半睡半醒呢。 哪里是二+基尼呢！难怪您会动这么大气。难道我说的是二+基尼吗？ 不，不，我想说的是二十先令，请您相信。您要是仔细考虑一下，就不会 认为这个价码太高啦。诚然，您也许花不了这么多钱就可以买上一把样子 和这把差不多的军刀，不过……”
琼斯这时打断他的话说："我不但不和你争价钱，还要比你要的多出一 个先令。"就给了军士一个基尼，吩咐他回去睡觉，祝他行军顺利。然后又 补上一句：说他自己希望部队到达沃斯特之前能赶上来。
军士彬彬有礼地向他告别，对成交的这笔生意十分满意，对他自己由 于误认病人神志不清几乎惹事，终于又从那窘境中摆脱出来的巧妙手段，
颇为自鸣得意。
军士刚一走开，琼斯就从床上爬起，穿好衣裳，甚至连外套也披上。 外套是白色的，上面的血迹清晰可见。正当他握着新买到的军刀准备走出 房间的时候，猛地想起此去他要干的是什么。他开始想：几分钟以后，也 许他将要剥夺一个人的生命，说不定将丧失自己的生命。他自言自语 道："那么，我究竟为了什么去冒这种险呢？啊，是为了维护我的名誉。对 手是个什么样的人？是个无缘无故地伤害我、侮辱我的流氓。然而报复不 是上天所禁止的吗？对，但却是人世所坚持的。那么，难道我该遵从世人 而违背上天的禁令吗？难道我宁可触怒天廷也不让人叫我作……胆小 鬼……下流货吗？我不再想下去了。干脆下决心跟他干一场去吧。”
时钟敲了十二下，除了看押诺塞顿的卫兵，整个客栈里的人们都入睡 了。这时，琼斯轻轻打开房内去寻找他的仇人。事先，茶房已经把禁闭诺 塞顿的地方详详细细地对他讲了。设想一个比此刻的琼斯更为可怕的形象 是不容易的。正如我们刚才所说，他身穿浅色外套，上面沾着一道道血 迹。由于流出那么多血，又加上外科医生抽出二十盎司去，所以他面色惨 白如灰。头上裹着一大堆绷带，很像是东方人扎的缠头布。他右手持军 刀，左手端着蜡烛，这样一来，连血淋淋的班柯驱比起来也要大为逊色。老 实说，像这样可怕的一个幽灵，我相信在任何坟场也没法见到。甚至萨默 塞特郡那些冬夜围坐在圣诞炉畔说东道西的善男信女也想象不出来。
当我们的主人公走近的时候，那个卫兵的头发就在他的皮军帽下面徐 徐竖起，同时，两个膝盖也磕碰起来。顿时，他通身起了比发疟子更厉害 的颤抖。于是，他放了一枪，随后就扑倒在地。
放这一枪究竟是出于恐怖还是勇敢，究竟他朝没朝他所害怕的目标瞄 准，我不能确言。可是倘若他曾瞄准的话，总算很幸运，他没有打中。
琼斯见那家伙倒下来，猜出使他害怕的原因，不禁笑了，丝毫也没理 会到刚才险遭枪击。这时，那个卫兵依然趴在地上，琼斯就从他身边走 过，径直进了房间一一他听说诺塞顿就关在这里。琼斯发现房里空无一 人，桌上放着一只一升四装的空罐子，桌面上洒了些啤酒。看来这房间不久 以前还有人住过，可是眼下是空空荡荡的。
琼斯以为这里和旁的房间通着，可是四下仔细搜了一遍，除了他迈进 的、也就是卫兵把守的那个门以外就再没有旁的门了。他又大声喊了几遍 诺塞顿的名字，也没人答应。琼斯这么一喊，徒然令那个卫兵更加认为自
己害怕得有道理，他断定志愿兵已经因伤致命，其鬼魂正在寻找杀害他的 那个冤家。卫兵躺在那里吓破了胆。但愿那些将扮演失魂丧胆角色的演员 能看到这个卫兵，这样，他们就可以向自然学习模仿，而不再玩那套徒然 使顶层楼座的观众开心，弓I他们喝彩的滑稽把戏了。
我们的主人公看到笼中的鸟儿已经飞去，起码是没法找到他了，并且 估计到枪声准会惊动整个客栈，就吹灭了蜡烛，悄悄走回自己的房间，重 新躺在床上。要不是那个楼梯间只住着一位患痛风病、起不了床的先生的 话，琼斯大概也会给人瞧见的，因为在他还没走到自己的房门之前，本来 有卫兵把守的那个大厅里就几乎挤满了人，有的只穿衬衣，有的半裸着， 大家都急急地相互询问究竟发生了什么事。
人们发现那个卫兵还是照我们前边说的那个姿势趴在原来的地方。有 几个人当即想把他拖起来，有的断定他已经死了；可是这些人立刻就发觉 他们错了，因为卫兵不但跟拖他的人拼命挣扎，并且还像头公牛般地吼 叫。原来他以为是许多精灵或是魔鬼在捉弄他。既然卫兵的头脑为怕鬼的 念头所支配，他就把自己所看到或者触到的一切，都看成是妖魔鬼怪了。
最后，由于寡不敌众，他终于被人从地上拖了起来。等拿来蜡烛，卫 兵看到身边站着两三个伙伴，他才清醒了些。可是当大家问他怎么回事的 时候，他回答说："我死了，一句话，我死了。我看到他了，我的魂儿再也 回不来啦。""杰克，你看到什么啦？"一个士兵问道。"喏，我看见昨天被 打死的那个志愿兵啦。"然后他赌了几个恶咒，说他千真万确地看到志愿兵 满身是血，口鼻喷吐火焰，从他身边走进监禁旗手诺塞顿的那个房间，一 把抓住旗手的咽喉，一声霹雳，就同他一道腾空而去。
这段叙述颇受到听众的赞赏。在场的女人都坚信不疑，并且一致祷告 上帝保佑她们不至于被杀害。男人中间也有不少信以为真的，可是另外一 些人却只把他的话当作笑柄奚落了一番。在场的一个军士还冷冷地对他 说："小伙子，你站岗的时候竟敢睡觉做梦，事情不会就这么完结的！”
那个士兵回答说："你尽管处罚我，可我当时就像现在一样清醒。要是 我没看见那个死人一一两只眼睛睁得大大的，亮得像两个大火炬，那就让 魔鬼像抓走旗手那样把我也抓去。”
队伍的指挥者和这家客栈的指挥者同时来到了。前者当时还没入睡， 听到卫兵的枪声，尽管他不认为会发生什么大事情，想着还是应该立刻起
来。可是后者所担心的就多了，她生怕自己的汤匙酒盅没奉到她的命令就 擅自开拔了。
对这个可怜的卫兵来说，中尉的出现并不比刚才那个鬼魂更受欢迎。 他又把这个可怕的故事添枝加叶地叙述了一遍，然而不幸的是，这两位全 不相信他所说的。中尉笃信宗教，但是他向来没有这一类的恐惧；而且我 们已经看到中尉刚才离开时琼斯是什么样子，他自然丝毫不会猜想琼斯竟 然死了。至于客栈老板娘，她虽然对宗教不怎么热心，对鬼怪的说法倒也 没有反感；不过卫兵的故事中有一段情节她明知是捏造的一一详情等一下 再向读者交代。
不管诺塞顿是在雷火中给抓走的，还是用旁的方法跑掉了，反正他这 个人已不在原来禁闭的地方，这是千真万确的。面临这种情况，中尉得出 的结论和我们刚才所述军士的话没有很大出入，于是，他吩咐马上把卫兵 看押起来。这样一来，由于命运奇妙的逆转（这种逆转在军队里是极其平 常的事），监守的人一下又变为被监守的了。
第十五章
前一桩意外事件的结局
除去在岗哨上睡大觉之外，中尉还怀疑这个可怜的卫兵犯了更严重的 罪过：有意把犯人私放了。他对那些妖魔鬼怪是一个字也不信的，因此他 就认为事实上那家伙接受诺塞顿的贿赂把他放了，而卫兵编造这些话只是 为了哄骗他。尤其引起中尉这么猜疑的是因为那个卫兵在联队里素来以勇 猛著称，他身经几次战役，受过几次伤，一直不愧为一名好样的勇士，因 而他害怕鬼怪就更加显得不可信了。
为了避免读者对这个人物形成不好的印象，我们决不迟延，马上就来 替他洗刷这份冤枉。
前边已经说过，诺塞顿先生对于那一击所获得的光彩心里非常满意。 他也许耳闻目睹或者猜测到名望往往会招来妒忌。我并不是在暗示他信奉 邪门歪道，崇拜报复女神，因为我相信其实他从来也没听说过这位女神的 名字。此外，他还是个很好动的人，对于保安官可能请他进去小住的格洛 斯特城堡的黑屋子深恶痛绝。当他想起某一木制高架时，也不无惶恐之感 ――遵照一般习惯，这里姑且不说出那木架子的名称，不过我认为人类不 应把这东西看作耻辱，而理应引以为荣，因为它是（或许起码可能是）几 乎所有的公共建筑中为社会造福最大的。我们就不再替诺塞顿先生的行为 列举更多的理由了，总之一句话，他急于在那天晚上离开客栈，需要的只 是一条方便之路，而这条路还颇不容易找到。
应当交代一下：尽管这位年轻绅士在道德上颇欠正直，他的身子却生 得直挺挺的；他体格匀称壮实，脸蛋在大多数妇女眼中也称得起漂亮，面 庞宽阔红润，还有一口的好牙齿。这样的翩翩风度自然不会不在老板娘的 心目中留下印象，她对这种美色一向颇为喜爱。她从心坎上同情这个年轻 人。所以当她从外科大夫那里听说志愿兵命在旦夕的时候，她就担心旗手 的前途有些不妙。老板娘在得到许可之后，就去会见诺塞顿，看见这位旗 手正在发愁；而当诺塞顿听到她说志愿兵性命难保后，就更愁得厉害了。 这时，老板娘就给了他些暗示，旗手也求之不得地接受了那些暗示，他们 彼此马上达成默契。最后他们约定：旗手一得到某种暗号就爬上烟囱，那 是和厨房的烟囱相连的，他可以从厨房这边爬下来；老板娘将把厨房里的 人都打发走，好给他下来的机会。
不过，为了避免别一种性格的读者根据这件事遽然把对旁人的同情一 概斥为有害于社会的愚蠢行为，我们理应在这里提提另外一个细节，它可 能与促使老板娘采取这一步骤也有些关系。旗手当时身边恰好带着五+ 镑，其实，这笔钱是整个连队的，因为自从大尉和中尉吵了架之后，就把 全连发饷的事务交给旗手办理了。旗手认为这笔钱最好交给老板娘保管， 作为押金或保证金，保证将来开审时他一定到庭申辩。不管条件是怎么讲 的，确凿无疑的是：老板娘得到了钱，而旗手得到了自由。
老板娘既然这么富于同情心，读者也许指望她明明晓得那个可怜的卫 兵无辜被捕，一定会立刻出面替他求情吧。究竟是由于她的同情心已经在 诺塞顿身上用光了呢，还是由于尽管这个卫兵的五官生得与旗手没多大差 别，却引不起她的同情心来，我不便断言；总之她不但不去替当前这个囚 犯辩护，反而在中尉面前极力说他的坏话。她两眼朝上望着，举起双手来 说：就是把全世界都给了她，她也决不会去帮助一个杀人犯逃跑。
这时，客栈又安静下来，刚才聚集的人多半都回床睡觉去了。可是老 板娘也许由于天性喜欢热闹，要不就是怕丢失碟子，却没有睡觉的意思。 当时离队伍开拔已经不到一个钟头了，她就劝军官们陪她喝盅潘趣酒。
琼斯一直都是醒着躺在那里。刚才那阵吵吵嚷嚷他大都听到了，很想 了解一下详细的情况。于是，他就拉了拉铃，拉了至少有二十遍也没人答 应。这时，老板娘正和她的客人们玩得开心，只听到她自己的舌簧鼓动， 却听不到铃铛的响声，而茶房和客栈的女仆坐在厨房里（茶房不敢一个人 守在那儿，女仆又不敢独自去睡），铃声响得越紧，他们怕得越厉害，两 个好像给钉在座位上，动弹不了啦。
最后，幸而谈话有了一阵间歇，这位好心的老板娘才听到了铃声。她 立刻喊两个仆人，他们也应声来到。"乔，"女主人说，"你没听见那位先生 拉铃吗？怎么还不上去招呼房间不是我的责任，"茶房说，"这是女仆 贝蒂应负责的事。""要是这么说的话，伺候男客人根本不是我的事，"女仆 说，"有时候我确实也管过，可是你既然这么说，我要是再管，就叫魔鬼把 我抓去。"铃声仍然大声地响着。老板娘气极了，就赌咒说，倘若茶房不立 刻上去，天亮就让他滚蛋。"太太，您要赶我，我也没办法，"他说，"反正 我不能替旁的用人代劳。"老板娘又去求女仆，好言好语来劝她，可是劝也 白劝，贝蒂跟乔一样不肯让步，两个都推说不是他们份内的事，都不肯去 做。
这时，中尉就笑起来，说："还是我来了结这场争论吧。"然后就转向 用人，夸奖他们固执己见做得很对，不过接着说，他相信要是一个肯去， 另一个一定会陪着去。这个提议立刻得到两人的同意。于是，他们就紧挨 在一起，亲亲热热地上楼去了。两人走后，中尉劝老板娘消消气，向她解 释了一下为什么他们不肯单独上去的道理。
不大工夫，两个用人回来了，告诉女主人说，那位受伤的客人不但没 死，他谈话时那股热烈勤头就像没受过伤一样。还说他向队长表示敬意， 很希望在开拔以前能见队长一面。
好心的中尉立刻应琼斯的请求坐到他的床边了。他把楼下发生的事向 琼斯说了，最后还告诉他说，打算严办那个卫兵，以儆效尤。
这时，琼斯就把事情的全部真相告诉了他，并且恳切央求他不可惩罚 那个可怜的卫兵，还说："我相信在旗手逃跑这件事上他是无辜的，正如他 没编造什么谎言，或者想欺骗您。”
中尉犹豫了一阵，然后回答说："既然你替这小伙子洗清了一部分罪 名，那么，其余的部分也没法成立了，因为当时值岗的不止他一个人。可 是我还想为这个浑蛋的卑怯行为惩罚他一通。然而谁能说这种恐怖心情会 产生什么样的作用呢！而且，老实说，在敌人面前他一向还是英勇的。算 啦，在这些家伙身上能看到些宗教的痕迹总还是好的，所以我答应你临开 拔之前一定把他释放了。可是，听，集合鼓响了。好孩子，咱们再亲一下 吧。不要苦恼，不要着急，只要记住基督教的坚忍之道。我担保你不久就 一定可以对那个伤害你的人进行报复，挽回自己的面子的。”说完之后，中 尉就告辞走了，琼斯则竭力安下心来静养。

第八卷
两天左右的事
第一章
这一章特别长，是本书序章中最长的，谈谈写“离奇”的问题
我们现在又开始一卷新书，故事的进程迫使我们不得不在这一卷里叙 述一些离奇而出人意外的事情，这是前几卷书所不能比拟的。因此，在这 篇序章（或者说小引）里，关于被称作"离奇”的那种作品，我们不妨先交 代几句。为了我们自己，也为了别人，我们想为它先划定一个范围，因为 各种不同派别的批评家［1］在这个问题上往往都容易各走极端。有些人和达歇 ⑵先生一样，愿意承认不可能的事情有时依然还会发生；另外一些人则几乎 完全不相信历史及诗歌，凡是不曾亲眼见过的事物，他们一概不认为是可 能的或盖然的⑶。
因此，首先我认为我们很有理由要求每个作家务必不要越出可能性的 范围，更要记住凡是人所不能做到的事，就很难令大家相信某人曾经做到 过。也许正是由于上述这一概念，才产生许多关于古代异教［4］神祇的故事 （这些神祇最早大半都是来自诗篇）。诗人为了放纵自己狂野不羁的想象 力恣意驰骋，就借助于神祇的力量。读者对这种神力的限度是无从判断的 ――或者不如说，他们以为神的力量是无限的。因此，不论写得多么离奇 古怪，读者也不会吃惊。替荷马笔下的奇迹辩护的人曾经把这一点作为他 们强有力的论据。这也许不失为一种辩护，然而却并非像蒲伯先生所说 的，是因为尤利西斯对那极其迟钝的民族腓依基人撒了一片愚蠢的谎言；［5］ 而是因为诗人是写给异教徒看的，对他们来说，诗歌中的神话就像信条那 样确凿可信。至于我自己，我不得不承认一向心肠软，总巴不得波吕菲谟 当初只吃奶制品，这样他就可以保住自己的眼睛了© ；而当尤利西斯的同伴 被刻尔吉［刀变成猪猡时，我的担忧绝不在尤利西斯之下。我想刻尔吉后来显 得那么尊重人肉，她不可能把它变成熏猪肉了。同样，我也衷心惋惜荷马 不曾晓得贺拉斯所定的那条规则：尽量少使用超自然的力量。倘若当初荷 马晓得的话，他就不会为一些小事动辄派遣天神下凡；这些天神的所作所 为不但完全失掉了人们的尊敬，而且还成为冷嘲热讽的对象。这种做法势 必使那些虔诚而精明的异教徒们大吃一惊，难以置信。我们也无法解释这 种做法，除非大家同意我有时候颇愿作出的这么一个假定：这位毫无疑问 最光辉的诗人有意要揶揄他自己的时代和他本国的迷信。
上面这片道理对基督教徒作家说来没什么用处，关于它，我谈得已经 太多了。基督教徒作家相信有天使，但是却不能把天使写进他的作品里 去；同样，到异教的经文里去找寻那些早已从永恒的宝座上贬下凡界的神 祇也是极其幼稚的事。夏弗茨贝利爵爷说过，再没有比现代作家去召唤诗 神更乏味的事了；其实，他还可以补上一句：没有比那更加荒唐的了。与 其那样，现代诗人还不如向民谣召唤，也许要风雅得多一一有人认为荷马 就曾那么做过；要不就跟《虎迪布拉斯》的作者一样，向淡啤酒召唤。受 一杯淡啤酒的启发而写出的诗文，也许比饮了喜坡克林或赫立孔山所有的 泉水而写出的还要多得多。
我们现代人唯一可以搬用一下的超自然的东西只有鬼了，奉劝作家对 这种幽灵还是以少搬用为妙。鬼就像药物中的砒霜或其他毒药一样，用的 时候要格外慎重。要是某些作家或作品经不起读者一场捧腹大笑，那样一 来会使作者或作品蒙受侮辱或损害的话，我就干脆劝他们完全不要搬用 鬼。
至于小精灵、小仙女以及其他类似的哑剧中的角色，我故意没提，因 为我并不愿意把奇异奔放的想象辖制起来一一人性的范围毕竟太窄狭了， 不够驰骋的。应当把这种作品看作一种崭新的创造，从而，它们的作者应 当有权随心所欲地去写作。
因此，除了极为特殊的情况而外，人是供我们的历史家及诗人写作的 最崇高的题材。在叙述人的行动时，要十分当心；切不可超出我们所描写 的对象的能力范围。
仅仅具有可能性还是站不住脚的，还需要恪守盖然性的原则。我记得 好像亚里士多德发表过这么个意见（如果不是他的话，反正也是某一位哲 人一一等他像亚里士多德那样古老的时候，他的话自然也会具有同样巨大 的权威）："诗人叙述不能令人置信的事物，即使他说的确有其事，也无法 替自己开脱。"这话用在诗歌上也许是正确的，如果引申到历史上去，也许 人们就认为行不通了，因为历史家只能照录事实，即使事情的性质十分离 奇，需要对历史坚信不疑才能囫囵吞枣地接受下来。诸如赫洛多特斯笔下 色克塞斯的一败涂地气以及阿里安所叙述的亚历山大远征理］的成功；又如 以后亨利五世在阿金库尔的奏凯以，以及瑞典查理十二世在纳尔瓦所获的胜 利四。所有这些事例，我们越寻思就越会感到惊异。
然而这类事实既然在历史的进程中出现，甚至还构成其主要部分，那 么历史家就有充分理由如实地加以记录，如果他把这些略去或加以篡改， 还是大逆不道呢。不过，另外还有一些不那么重要或者不是非记载下来不 可的史实，尽管已经证明翔实可靠，但是为了避免引起读者的疑窦，最好 还是割爱，任其湮没为宜。关于乔治•威烈尔鬼魂出现的那个脍炙人口的故 事珥便是一例：这类故事奉赠给德莱林科博士更合适些，让他把威烈尔的鬼 魂与维勒太太的鬼魂一并写在他的论死亡一书的前面也］,而不必把它放到类 似《叛乱史》这样严肃的著作里。
老实说，倘若历史家只限于写确曾发生过的事，对于那些他肯定认为 是捏造的事实，不管证据如何确凿，一概加以摒弃，那么尽管他有时会写 得很离奇，却绝不会令人觉得不可信。他往往会引起读者的惊异，出乎他 们意料之外，但是他永远也不会使人觉得像贺拉斯所说的"穿凿附会，令人 生厌"。由此可见，我们一般总是由于去虚构，才违反并放弃盖然性这条原 则一一历史家向来不，或者很少放弃这条原则，一旦那样做时，他也就写 不成人物，而改写起传奇了。在这方面，那些记述公共事务的历史家比我 们只限于写私生活场面的作家处境要优越得多。历史家所叙述的事实是家 喻户晓的，因而他们长期以来一直拥有人们的信任。同时又有公共档案以 及许多作者一致的佐证，后世可以完全相信其真实性。例如图拉真、安东 尼、尼禄、卡利古拉，也后世都相信确有其人，没人怀疑如此善良以及如此 凶恶的人，一度曾是人类的统治者。
然而我们这些同并非众所周知的人物打交道的作家，处境就没那么稳 当了。我们得到最隐蔽的角落里去探索，从穷乡僻壤去挖掘善与恶的事 迹。我们写的人物既然不是众所周知的，又没有旁证及公共档案可据，就 不但应该严守可能性的界限，并且也不可超出盖然性的范围；在我们描绘 极其善良可爱的人物时，尤其要注意这一点。邪恶和愚蠢不管达到怎样骇 人听闻的地步，也不难使人们信以为真，因为人性中邪恶的一面对这种信 念给予了有力的支持。
我们不妨谈谈斐舍尔的事也。很久以来他都是靠达尔比先生的慷慨赒济 过活的。一天早晨，他刚从达尔比先生手里接到相当大的一笔资助，就想 把这位朋友写字台里其余的钱财也据为己有。于是，就在法学院的一间办 公室里隐藏起来，这里有一条甬道直通达尔比先生的房间。这天晚上达尔 比先生请了几个朋友来聚聚，斐舍尔本来也在邀请之列，但是他却在内外
站了好几个钟头，偷听达尔比先生向朋友们诉说自己的情怀。尽管斐舍尔 偷听了那么半天，可是他既没有感激之意，对所听到的一切也无动于衷， 还是非达到目的不可。当那位可怜的绅士把客人送出办公室之后，他就突 然从躲藏的角落里钻了出来，蹑手蹑脚地跟在那位朋友后头走进房间，然 后对准达尔比先生的头开了一枪。就是到了斐舍尔的骨头像他的心那样腐 烂了的那一天，人们对这件事也还是坚信不疑的。不但如此，我们也许还 会相信两天之后，这个恶棍陪几位小姐去看《哈姆雷特》这出戏；当其中 -位嚷着"老天爷，要是杀害达尔比先生的那个凶手也在场该有多 好！"（她不知道凶手坐得挨她多么近）时，斐舍尔听了居然不动声色，表 现得比尼禄M的良心还要冷酷、残忍。据绥通涅斯四的记载，"尼禄弑母之 后，立即深感内疚，长时期痛苦难忍；兵士、元老以及百姓向他祝贺，也 未能减轻他良心上的战栗不安。”
然而另一方面，倘若我告诉读者说，我认识这样一个人，他凭着洞察 事物的天才，未经任何人筹划就发了一笔大财。他这笔财是在对本人人格 毫无损害的情况下发的：不但完全没委屈或坑害过谁，甚至还能大大促进 贸易，为国库增加巨额收入；这人把他的一部分财产用来购藏最高雅而纯 朴的艺术品，从而显示出他鉴赏力的不平凡；他又用他的另一部分收入来 赒济那些唯一的长处是卓有才能或是处境贫困的人，从而显示出他的仁慈 超众。这人还非常热心于寻访落魄的贤才，急于解囊相助，并且同样急于 把自己的善行掩藏起来（也许掩藏得过于严实了）；这人的住宅、用具、 园林、餐桌，他私下的好客以及公开的义举，在在都足以表明他心地之崇 高深厚，绝不着眼于外表的矫饰。他待人以德，极为得体；他虔信上帝， 对国王忠心耿耿，对妻子至为温柔，对亲戚极其慈祥。他是个慷慨的保护 人，热诚可靠的朋友，愉快而体贴的伙伴。他对仆人宽大，对邻居殷勤， 对穷人乐善好施，对一切人都以慈悲为怀。倘若此外我把聪明、英勇、文 雅以及我们语言里一切其他美好的字眼也加上去，那么我一定会感叹道：
—Quis credet ? nemo Hercule ! nemo ； Vel duo, vel nemo ；也
可是我却晓得有一个人丝完全符合以上的描述。然而仅仅一个孤单单的例子 （我的确不知道有第二个这样的人）是不足为凭的。因为我们的作品是写 给千千万万读者看的，而他们从来也没听说过有这么个人一一或类似这样 的一个人物。这种rarae aves［21］应该留给墓志铭的作者去颂扬，或许由一 位诗人替他写一首短诗或者信笔编上几句轻松的顺口溜，谅来也不会引起 读者的反感。
最后，写动作不但不可超出人力的范围所及，须是合情合理，而且还 得是这个特定角色或人物很可能做得出的，因为一个动作出自这个人也许 只不过引起一些惊奇而已，出自另外一个人则变为不可信一一甚至不可 能。
最后这一条正是戏剧评论家所谓的"性格的协调"。做到这点需要卓绝的 判断力和对人性的精湛的认识。
—位极优秀的作家说得好：一个人不管多么热切，也不会完全违背他 自己的意志行事，正如不管水势多么湍急，也决不会让船逆流而上。我要 大胆地说：使人违反他的本性来行事，倘非不可能，至少也是不近情理 的，那真是天底下的奇闻。要是把安东尼先生的事迹中最好的部分写到尼 禄的头上，又把尼禄一生最残暴的事算在安东尼的账上，还有什么比这更 使人惊异而难以置信呢？反之，把这两个人所做的事各写在各人的账上， 才能构成真正的"离奇"。
我们当代的喜剧作家们几乎没有不犯上述错误的。在前四幕里，他们 的男主人公大都是臭名远扬的恶棍，女主人公大都是不可救药的荡妇；可 是到了第五幕，男主人公却突然摇身一变而成为极可尊敬的绅士，女主人 公一下子也变为端庄贤淑的闺秀。作者往往还不肯做做好事，费心向读者 解释一下这种荒唐变化的道理何在，前后的矛盾如何自圆其说。我们的确 找不到旁的理由，只能归结为戏已经快要收场了；好像恶棍到了戏的最后 一幕，就如他的生命到最后一幕一样，会自然而然地痛改前非。我们在泰 堡丝所看到的往往就是这样，那地方作为某些喜剧收尾的场所真是再恰当不 过了，因为剧中那些主人公通常都具有超众的才能，不仅能把自己送上绞 刑架，并且还可以在那里一逞英雄。
在以上的范围之内，我认为随便作家写得多么离奇都是可以的一一而 且，只要他能严守可信性的原则，写得越是离奇，就越能吸引读者，因而 也就越能使他神往。有一位头等的天才四在他论降格法也］第五章中写
道："一切诗歌的艺术，其上乘是能将真实与虚构杂糅在一起，以便把可信 的与使人惊奇的部分融为一体。”
因为尽管每个优秀的作家都应当严守盖然性的范围，但是他笔下的人 物或情节并不一定要庸俗、平凡、老一套，就像在街上和普通人家里，或 是在报纸国内新闻栏里时常看到的。他也不必顾虑重重，不敢去写大多数 读者可能从来也不晓得的人物或事情。作家只要遵守了上述的原则，他就 尽到了职责，就有权利要求读者对他所写的给以一定的信任。倘若读者还 不肯相信，那就是读者吹毛求疵，无端猜疑了。
说起读者不信任的问题来，可以举个例子。记得有一回，戏院观众里 许多书记、学徒都异口同声咒骂舞台上某某贵族小姐演得不像，尽管这个 角色以前得到了观众中许多第一流仕女们的赞赏，其中一位特别以见识著 称的夫人还说，在她所认识的妇女当中，有一半都是这个样子。
第二章
客栈老板娘来探望琼斯先生
琼斯在他的中尉朋友走了以后，竭力想合上眼睛养养神，可是怎么也 不行。他的精神过于亢奋，清醒，总也不能入睡。他于是用怀念苏菲亚的 情思来安慰，或者还不如说来折磨自己，一直到天色大亮。他向店家要茶 水时，老板娘借此亲自来探望他了。
这确乎是她头一回看到琼斯，至少是头一回留意到他。既然中尉向她 保证琼斯确实是一位上流社会的少爷，她就决计尽量向琼斯表示敬意。老 实说，这正是一家绅士们花钱就能受到热情招待（用广告上的话来说）的 客栈。
她刚一替琼斯沏上茶，就立即说开了 ："哎呀，先生，多么不值得呀， 这么漂亮的一位少爷竟然降低身份，去跟那些大兵厮混在一起！他们还自 命为绅士呢。可是，正像我前夫过去常说的，那些人应该不要忘记是我们 养活他们的。像我们这样开店的，不得不出钱供养他们，这真不是件容易 事。昨天晚上除去军官还来了二十个大兵。说到这儿，我宁愿招待大兵也 不愿意招待军官：怎么也不能让那些公子哥儿满意。可是等一算账啊， 呸，没几个大钱！要是招待一位阔乡绅和他的一家，我费的事要少得多， 一晚上足能挣上四五十个先令一一牲口的账还在外。可是那些军官，个个 摆出的派头都像一年有五百镑进益的乡绅。说真的，听那些兵士长官长、 长官短地叫着，可真让人笑掉大牙！去他妈的长官吧，一个人也就吃一先 令一份的客饭！而且他们满口总是骂骂咧咧的，听了真叫人吓一跳。我看 这些坏蛋是永远不会发迹的。瞧，他们中间的一个把您欺负得好苦！我本 来以为他们会好好看押着那个人的，其实，他们全是一伙儿。我很高兴看 到您现在已没什么生命危险了，要是真有危险，这些坏蛋也不会在意的。 他们照样会把凶手放掉。上帝饶恕他们吧，就是把整个世界给我，我也不 去造这种孽。感谢上帝，您的伤大概快好啦，可是还得跟他打官司呢。您 要是请斯默尔律师来办理的话，我敢打赌他一定叫那家伙不能在英国存 身；不过，也许等不到那时候他就早已跑到外国去了。这种人总是今天在 这儿，明天又没影儿了的。不过我希望您以后无论如何要学点乖，还是回 到您的朋友那里去吧。我敢说他们失掉您一定都很难过。他们要是晓得发 生了什么事的话一一啊，我想到哪儿去啦！我决不会让他们晓得的。得
啦，得啦，我们晓得是怎么回事。不过这个不答应，别一个总会答应的。 这么漂亮的一位少爷还愁没人爱？我要是您的话，宁愿看到天字第一号的 美人儿给绞死，也决不肯为了她去当大兵。不，别这么脸红！（琼斯的脸 确实涨得通红。）先生，关于苏菲亚小姐的事，您以为我什么也不晓得 哩。皿怎么？ ”琼斯大吃一惊地说，"您认得我的苏菲亚吗？皿怎么不认 得！"客栈老板娘大声说，"她在我这客栈里不晓得住了多少回啦。""是跟 她姑姑一起来的吧？"琼斯问道。"可不是嘛！"老板娘叫着说，"哎，哎， 哎，我跟那位老太太很熟。苏菲亚小姐长得多可爱呀，这一点儿也不 差。""可爱！"琼斯惊叫着，"说得真对！ ”
为了和她争妍，天使也得穿上盛装， 我们所信的天堂，就体现在她身上： 无限的智慧、纯洁和真挚， 永恒的欢乐和万古长青的爱。丝］
"我怎么想得到你居然认识我的苏菲亚！""您对她熟悉的程度未必赶得 上我的一半哩，"老板娘说，"要是能够坐在她的床旁边，您什么代价也肯 出吧！她的脖子多么惹人爱呀。她那美丽的身子就曾经躺在您眼下躺的这 张床上。""这儿！"琼斯嚷道，"她真的在这儿躺过？""可不是嘛，"老板娘 说道，"就在这张床上，我真恨不得她此刻还躺在这儿，我看她本人也巴不 得这样，因为她曾经对我提过您的名字。""啊！”琼斯大声说，"她真的提 过她这个可怜的琼斯的名字吗？您一定是说说叫我听了高兴罢了。我是无 论如何也不能相信的。""不信我就赌咒，"她回答说。"我是还指望进天堂 的。要是有一个字儿是我编造的，那么就让魔鬼把我抓去。我确实听她提 过琼斯先生的名字，不过她说的时候羞答答的，很有分寸。可是我看得出 她的情意要比话语深长多了呢。""啊，亲爱的老板娘！"琼斯嚷道，"我是 不配叫她这么怀念的。她真是最温柔，最体贴，最善良了 ！天为什么要生 我这么一个孽种，害得她那颗温柔的心哪怕感到片刻的不安呢！我怎么这 么该死呀。只要能对她有些微好处，我情愿经历魔鬼为人类所制造的一切 灾难和祸患。只要我晓得她是幸福的，就是受酷刑我也不会感到痛 苦。""说到这儿我倒想起来了，"老板娘说，"我告诉她说，您是一位永不 变心的情郎。""不过请问，"琼斯说，"你什么时候、在什么地方听说过关
于我的事？我从来也没到过这儿，也不记得看见过你。皿您当然不会记 得，"老板娘回答说，"因为我在乡绅家里把您抱在膝头上的时候，您还是 个小娃娃呢。""在乡绅家里？”琼斯说，"那么你认得那位伟大而且仁厚的 奥尔华绥先生吗那还用说！"她回答说，"这一带哪个不晓得他。""他 的善名当然会流传得还要远，"琼斯说，"但是只有上帝才完全了解他，了 解他的仁慈。这种仁慈是以上帝为典范，而且是要世人都来仿效的。世人 不认识这种神圣的仁慈，也不配享受它一一而我比谁都不配。正是奥尔华 绥先生把我教养成人的。你一定知道得很清楚：我本是个出身低贱的孩 子，蒙他收养我，把我当亲生的儿子一般看待；而我竟冥顽不灵地辜负了 他，惹得他来惩罚我。对，我是完全罪有应得。我永远也不会忘恩负义， 认为他这样做是委屈了我。不，像我这样被赶出来是完全应该的。"琼斯又 说："那么老板娘，我想你也不会怪我为什么当起兵来，尤其当我口袋里只 剩这几个钱的时候。"说着，他就抖了抖钱袋，里面果然已没有多少钱了， 而在老板娘看来，则显得比实际还少。
这位好老板娘一听这话，就像俗话所说的，凉了半截。她冷冰冰地回 答说："一个人处在某种境遇该采取什么步骤，当然只有他本人晓得最清 楚。可是你听，我仿佛听到有人在叫。来啦！来啦！客栈里这些伙计全叫 魔鬼附了体，谁也没长耳朵！我得赶快下楼去。您要是还想吃点什么，我 喊女仆来吧。来啦！"说完这话，她连个招呼也不打就奔出门外去。下等人 在对人表示敬意的时候是很吝啬的。虽然在上流人面前他们肯白白地唯唯 诺诺，可是遇到身份同他们相等的人，在表示尊敬之前总要先估量一下能 不能得到充分的报偿。
第三章
外科大夫再度出场
为了避免读者过高地估计客栈老板娘对琼斯情况的了解，同时，也为 了不使读者由于她所晓得的那点底细而感到惊讶，在往下叙述之前，也许 有必要向大家说明：是中尉告诉她说，吵架是由苏菲亚的名字引起的。至 于其他情况，聪明的读者从上述情景也不难看出她是怎样得知的。强烈的 好奇心是这位老板娘的种种美德之一。对所有过往旅客的姓氏、门第、家 业没尽量打听个一清二楚之前，她总是不肯放他们离去的。
她刚一走开，琼斯并没理会到她行动的突兀，却只是立刻想到他是睡 在据说苏菲亚曾经睡过的床上。于是，他心中荡漾起千万种柔情蜜意；倘 若不是考虑到这样的痴情人在读者中间究竟为数不多的话，我们一定会把 它描述得更详细些。当外科大夫来替他换药的时候，琼斯就正在这样的心 境中。大夫发现他的脉搏紊乱，又听说他没睡觉，就宣布他病势危险，怕 他热度升高，主张用放血的办法来防止。但是琼斯不肯，说他不准备再损 失血液了。"大夫，"他说，"您只要费心替我把头部换换药，我相信不出一 两天就会好的。”
"说得倒好，"大夫说，"一两个月能好就算不错啦；不，不，这么重的 伤不会一下子就好的。不过我是不惯于大清早就听凭病人随便指手画脚 的。在换药之前，我一定得先放血。”
琼斯无论如何也不同意，最后，大夫只好让步了，同时，对琼斯说， 如果发生什么恶果，他可不能负责，希望病人到时候别使他蒙冤，要承认 当初他是建议过放血的。病人答应一定照办。
大夫来到厨房，向客栈老板娘百般埋怨病人不听话，发了烧还不让放 血。
"是吃得太饱了才发的烧，"老板娘说，"今天早晨一口气吃了两大块涂 牛油的烤面包。”
"很可能正是这样，"大夫说，"我遇到过发烧时照旧有胃口的病人，这 倒不难说明。由于发烧而产生的酸液可能刺激横膈膜的神经，于是乎就引 起与正常的胃口不大容易区别开的一种食欲。不过营养物不能凝结起来， 也不会消化成乳糜。这样一来，就会腐蚀血管的小孔，从而就使发烧症状
更加严重。我看那位先生的病势十分危险，要是不放血的话，我担心他会 死的。”
"一个人迟早总是要死的，"老板娘回答说，"这不关我的事。大夫，放 血的时候希望您可别叫我来按着他。喂，过来，我小声告诉您句话：别张 罗过分了，我劝您先打听一下谁来付钱。”
"谁来付钱？ ”大夫眼睛瞪得直直地说，"难道我经手治疗的不是一位有 身份的人？ ”
"我原来也跟您一样想法，"老板娘说，"不过，正像我的前夫过去常说 的，人不可以貌相。老实告诉您吧，他是个尽人皆知的下流货。自然，您 不必理会我说的这些话；不过咱们都是生意人，知道点什么底细总该互相 通通声息。”
“可是我居然容忍这样一个家伙来对我指手画脚！”大夫愤愤地嚷 道，"难道我能让一个付不出诊金的人来侮辱我的医道吗？幸亏我及时发觉 了这情况。我这就去看看他究竟让放血不让。”说完他立刻上楼去，猛地推 开门，把可怜的琼斯喊醒一一这时他正在酣睡，而且，更糟的是，他正在 做着一个关于苏菲亚的好梦。
“你倒是放不放血？"大夫气冲冲地吼道。"我已经告诉你我的决定 了，"琼斯回答说，"我衷心希望你肯拿我的话当话，我正在做最好的梦， 这下子你把我叫醒了。”
"对呀，对呀，"大夫大声说，"许多人就是睡死过去的。睡眠和食物一 样，并不总是有益的。但是请记住，这是我最后一次问你：究竟放不放 血？皿我也是最后一次答复你，”琼斯说，"不放。皿那么你就另请高明 吧，"大夫嚷道，"并且请你把诊金付给我。出诊两次，每次五先令；换药 两次，再加上五先令；静脉放血，半个克朗丝。皿我希望你不至于就这样丢 开我不管吧，"琼斯说。"正如你说的，不管啦。"大夫说。"那么你对我太 无赖了，我一个铜板也不给你。”琼斯说。"很好，”大夫嚷道，"吃亏越 早，吃亏越少。老板娘叫我来给你这流氓治病，真是倒霉！"说完，他就奔 出房间。病人翻了个身又重回睡乡，可惜他的美梦却消逝了。
第四章
介绍有史以来最有趣的一位理发师，便是巴格达的那位理发师 [27】或是《堂吉诃德》里的那位[28】也比不上他
琼斯醒来的时候，钟正敲五下。七个钟头的睡眠使他精神饱满，身体 健壮。他决定穿衣起床，于是就打开皮箱，取出干净的衬衫和一套外衣。 但是他先披上一件袍子，下楼到厨房去，想讨点东西来平息他肚皮里的风 波。
一看到老板娘，琼斯就彬彬有礼地向她打招呼，问有什么饭食可以给 他吃。"吃饭？"老板娘说，"天到这般时分还想吃饭，真是怪事！客栈里什 么也没预备，炉火也差不多熄啦。皿可是我非吃点什么不可，”琼斯 说，"什么都成。老实说，我一辈子从来还没这么饿过呢。""那么，"老板 娘说，"大概还有一片冷牛肉和胡萝卜，你吃去吧。""那再好没有啦，"琼 斯回答说，"可要是能替我煎一煎，就更感激不尽啦。"老板娘答应了，并 且笑了笑说，看到他的伤养得这么好，很是高兴。事实上，我们这位主人 公的温柔性格是使人无法不喜爱的，而老板娘本来也不是个坏性子的女 人；她只是因为过于爱财，所以凡是跟贫穷沾上边儿的，她总是+分讨 厌。
在老板娘替他准备饭菜的当儿，琼斯回到房间去梳洗打扮一番。他派 人去找的那位理发师来了。
大家管这理发师叫作小本杰明，他是个+分古怪而富有幽默感的家 伙，因而时常给自己招来一些小小的麻烦：诸如脸上挨一巴掌，屁股上吃 一脚，甚至给人打断骨头。因为并不是人人都听得懂玩笑的；那些听得懂 的，一碰到自己让人开了玩笑，往往也会发脾气。可是这位理发师不管吃 过多少苦头，总也改不了这个毛病。每当他想出一句俏皮话来时，就非说 出来不可，从不考虑是对什么人，在什么时候和什么场合。
此人性格上还有许多其他特点，我就不一一列举了。等读者对这位非 凡人物更熟悉一些后，自然就会看出。
琼斯急于快点理完发，理由不难猜出；他嫌替他刮脸的这个人总抓弄 肥皂水没个完，催他快一些。理发师十分庄重地（在任何情形下他也不动 声色）说:“Festina lent纹、这是远在我没摸剃刀之前就学会的一句格 言。""朋友，看来你还是位学者呢，"琼斯回答说。"一个浅薄的学者，"理
发师说，“non omnia possumus omnes四。”"又是一句！"琼斯说，"看 来你很善于摘引诗句哩。"“对不起，先生，"理发师说，“non tanto me dignor honored］。”说完了又继续刮起脸来。“先生，”他说，“自从我跟肥 皂泡打交道以来，我发现人们刮脸不外乎两种目的：一个是为了留起胡子 来，另一个是为了剃掉它。先生，我猜想您为前一种目的而刮脸，日子还 不算长吧。我敢说，您留的成绩很不坏，因为尊须可以说tondenti gravior图。"“我猜想你必是个十分滑稽的人，"琼斯说。"先生，这您可大 错特错啦，”理发师说，“先生，我太喜欢研究哲学了，hinc ilia lacryma国。这正是我生平的不幸。我就毁在学问太多上头啦。朋 友，”琼斯说，“我也不能不承认你的学问确乎远远超出一般的同行，可是 我看不出那怎么会损害了你。”“咳！先生，”理发师回答说，“我父亲就是 因为我的学问才取消我的财产继承权的。他是个舞蹈教师，就由于我没学 会跳舞之前先学会了读书，他就讨厌我，把财产尽数留给家里旁的孩子， 一个铜板也没分给我。您的鬓角也要……啊！对不起，想必是hiatus in manuscriptis醐。我听说您要上战场。可是我想这一定是误传。"“你为什么 这么想？”琼斯问道。“先生，因为以您这么聪明的人，一定不会头上带着 伤还去上战场的。那就等于往纽卡斯尔运煤［约！ ”
“你可真是个怪家伙，”琼斯大声说，“我非常喜欢你这种诙谐。饭后， 希望你来和我喝杯酒。我很想和你多认识认识。”
“啊，亲爱的先生，”理发师说，“只要您肯接受的话，我可以二十倍地 报答您这番好意。”“朋友，你指的是什么？ ”琼斯嚷道。“您要是高兴的 话，我可以和您喝上一瓶。我打心坎上喜欢好心肠的人。正像您的慧眼已 经看出我是个喜欢说笑的家伙，我也断定您是天底下心肠最好的绅士之 -，不然的话，那就算我没有相面的本领。”这时，琼斯衣冠楚楚地走下楼 去，也许阿都尼的翩翩风姿也比不上他。然而他对客栈老板娘却没有吸引 力。因为这位好妇人长得丝毫不像维纳斯，图同时也没有维纳斯那样的审美 力。倘若客栈的女仆南妮也用老板娘这种眼光来看琼斯，那她可就幸运多 了。可怜那个姑娘看到琼斯不上五分钟，就热烈地爱上他了，这份痴情害 得她后来不断长吁短叹。南妮生得十分秀丽，又极其腼腆。她曾经拒绝过 客栈里的一个茶房和附近一两个年轻的庄稼汉，然而看到我们这位主人公 那双神采奕奕的眸子，她那颗冰冷的心顷刻之间就融化了。
当琼斯回到厨房去的时候，餐桌上还没铺上台布；其实也没有必要铺 台布，因为给他吃的东西依然放在原处，热饭的火炉也没人去动一动。许 多富有涵养的人也会由于失望而发起火来，可是琼斯却没生气。他只温和 地责怪了老板娘一句，说："既然牛肉那么不好热，那就吃冷的吧。"可是 这时那个好女人不知是出于同情、惭愧，还是有什么其他用意，先把伙计 们挨个儿骂了一遍，责问为什么不照她的吩咐办一一其实，她压根儿也没 吩咐过；然后一面叫茶房在"日光室"里铺上餐巾，一面就认真张罗起来， 一会儿饭就准备停当了。
琼斯被引到"日光室"来，真是名不虚传，它简直是lucus a non lucendo勉，太阳几乎从来也没光顾过这里。它确实是客栈里最坏的一个房 间，而对琼斯说来，也幸而是如此。目前他实在太饿了，所以也顾不得去 挑毛病。可是他吃饱后，就吩咐茶房替他送一瓶酒到一个好一点的房间里 去，同时对于把他领到地牢里来吃饭的事，表示了几分愤慨。
茶房一切都照办了。过了一会儿，理发师也来了。本来他不会害琼斯 先生久等的，可是他在厨房里听老板娘讲了半天话。她招来一帮人，围在 一起听她讲不幸的琼斯的身世。这些情况，有的是她从琼斯本人口里套出 来的，有的则是她自己独出心裁的编造。她说琼斯是教区里的一个穷孩 子，被送到乡绅奥尔华绥的宅里。奥尔华绥先生把他收容下来，以学徒身 份养大。如今，因为他品行不端，尤其为了他和宅里的小姐吊膀子，同时 多半还偷过东西，给赶了出来。不然，他身上那点儿钱是哪里来的。"这就 是所谓的少爷，"她说。"乡绅奥尔华绥宅里的仆人！"理发师说，"请问， 他叫什么他告诉我他姓琼斯，"老板娘回答说，"也许用的是个假姓。 而且他还说，尽管乡绅现在跟他闹翻了，当初可是把他当作亲生儿子那么 抚养大的。""要是他告诉您他姓琼斯，这是实话，"理发师说，"因为我有 些亲戚在那一带住。有人甚至说，他就是乡绅的儿子。""那么他为什么不 姓他老子的姓？皿这我可说不上，”理发师说，"许多人就不姓老子的 姓。""啊，要是我早晓得他是个上流人的儿子，"老板娘说，"即使是个私 生子，我也不会那么慢待他，因为许多私生子后来都成了大人物。而且， 正像我那可怜的前夫过去常说的，永远不要得罪一个有身份的主顾。”
第五章
琼斯先生和理发师的对谈
理发师和老板娘交谈上面这段话的时候，琼斯先是坐在地牢里用饭， 后来就在客厅里等候本杰明。谈话刚一结束，理发师就来陪琼斯先生。琼 斯+分客气地请他坐下，替他斟满了酒，然后向他祝酒，称他为 doctissime tonsorum囹。“Ago tibi gratias，domine，㈣"理发师说， 然后用十分严肃而又似乎很惊讶的神情，定睛望着琼斯，仿佛在辨认曾经 见过的一张脸。"先生，请问贵姓是琼斯吗？ ”那一位回答说："正 是。""Proh deum atque hominum fidem !四”理发师说，“事情真有多 么巧呀！琼斯先生，我这里谨向您问候。看来您不认识我啦。这也难怪， 因为您仅仅见过我一面，而且那时候您还很小。请问，奥尔华绥先生一向 可好？那位ille optimus omnium patronus［竺的近况怎样看来你确实 认得我，"琼斯说，"只可惜我记不起你来了。”"这毫不足为奇，”本杰明大 声说，"可是我倒奇怪我自己怎么没早认出您来呢，因为您一点儿也没变。 请不要见怪，先生，我想知道一下您这是到哪里去理发师先生，”琼斯 说，"斟满你的酒杯，别再多问啦。""我不会惹您讨厌的，先生，”本杰明 说，"希望您也别把我看作一个不知深浅、喜欢刨根问底的人。谁也不能指 摘我有这种毛病。不过请原谅我这么想：像您这般身份的绅士，出门要是 随身不带个仆人，就不能不使人想到您是in casu incognito四，也许我不 该提您的大名。”"我得向你承认，"琼斯说，"我本来没料到这一带的人对 我这么熟悉。不过，为了一些特殊原因，在我离开这里以前，还请你不要 向任何人提起我的名字。”“Pauca verba四，"理发师回答说，“我也希望 这里除了我之外，再没有旁人晓得您。有些人专门好乱说，可是我可以向 您保证，我一定严守秘密。连仇恨我的人也不能不承认我这个美德。”"可 是，理发师先生，”琼斯说，“这个美德和你干的职业可不大相符 呀。"“咳，先生，”本杰明回答说，“Non si male nunc et olim sic erit驱。请您相信，我并非生来就是个理发匠，也不是作为理发匠来培养 的。我大半辈子都是和上流人一起度过的，可以说，我对上流社会略有所 知。如果您认为我可以像另外一些人一样得到您的信任的话，我就会向您 证明我比他们更能保守秘密。我决不会在人多口杂的大厨房里当众败坏您 的名誉。先生，老实说，有些人太对不起您了，不但把您告诉他们的关于
您和奥尔华绥先生吵嘴的事公开宣扬出去，还加上他们自己编造的谎言 ――我知道那一定是谎言。""这话使我很吃惊，"琼斯大声说。"先生，我 可以发誓说，这全是实情，"本杰明说，"您大概也猜得出，我指的就是客 栈的老板娘。听了她的话我很不安，我希望她说的全是假话。我十分敬重 您，确实是这样。自从听说您对黑乔治慨然相助的仁举，我一直对您十分 钦佩。这一带人人都在谈论那件事。我接到不止一封信，都提到了那事。 那件事使您受到老老少少的爱戴。听了老板娘的话，我心里真着急，所以 才向您问东问西，请您多多原谅。我并不喜欢无端探听旁人的私事，但是 我一向佩服仁慈的行为，因而amoris abundantia erga te四。”
人在患难中，听到任何友情的表示都更容易相信。琼斯不但处于困 境，而且生来对人毫不猜疑，无怪乎听了本杰明这番话，他立刻就都相信 了，并把本杰明引为知己。本杰明那几句拉丁文，有时用的还颇为恰当。 尽管算不上什么深奥的学识，但是毕竟似乎表明他比普通的理发师要略高 一筹；而他的一切举止莫不给人这种印象。本杰明所说的关于他自己的来 历和所受的教育等等，琼斯全相信了。最后，由于理发师一再恳求，琼斯 就说："朋友，你既然听到那么多关于我的话，并且好像很急于了解真相， 要是你有耐心听的话，我就把全部情况都告诉你吧。""不管讲多么长，我 都一定耐心静听的，"本杰明说，"而且我十分感激您对我的这番盛情。”
于是，琼斯就讲起他的全部经历，只遗漏了一两件，把他和屠瓦孔打 架那天的事全部略掉了。末了，琼斯谈到他本打算去海外，后来听说北部 发生了叛乱，他才改变主意，来到这个地方。
小本杰明仔细倾听着，一次也没插嘴。可是等琼斯讲完，他不禁表 示：一定是琼斯的仇人又编造了一些什么，在奥尔华绥先生面前告他的 状，不然的话，像奥尔华绥先生这么好的一个人，决不会把他自己十分疼 爱的孩子就这样赶出大门。琼斯听了回答说，他也不怀疑有人为了毁掉他 曾经使过阴谋诡计。
既然从琼斯口中听不到一件应使他受责罚的事，任何人都难免会说出 理发师那样的话来。琼斯自然不会从坏的方面去渲染自己的行为，像旁人 在奥尔华绥先生面前所做的那样。他也不可能提到旁人不时地在奥尔华绥 面前诬告他的那些事，因为他自己根本不知道。同时，正如我们在前边所 指出的，叙述时他还略掉了许多重要情况。总之，看来琼斯处处站在理 上，任凭怎样恶毒的人也不容易把罪名加到他头上。
琼斯并不是有意隐瞒或掩饰事实。不，他宁愿用自己的所作所为来说 明他是罪有应得，也不愿让奥尔华绥先生遭受非议，说对他惩罚不当。然 而实际上过去是这样，将来也永远还是这样：不管一个人多么诚实，在叙 述他自己的行为时，总难免会不期然而然地袒护自己，这样一来，某些污 点经他一说就洗清了，好似劣酒过滤以后，所有的渣滓就都滤掉了。看来 同一件事，由本人自述还是由一个仇人来叙述，在动机、情节和后果方面 都可以有很大差别，使得我们几乎难以认出谈的是同一件事。
尽管理发师如饥似渴地把故事全都听了进去，可是他还感到不满足。 他的好奇心虽然并不怎么强烈，有一点他却很急于想知道。琼斯谈到他的 恋爱，并且提到布利非是他的情敌，可是他很慎重，故意避免提那位小姐 的名字。因此，理发师犹豫了一阵，又嗯嗯呃呃了几声，最后问起了那位 小姐的名字，看来她是琼斯一切灾难的主要原因。琼斯沉吟了半晌，然后 说道："我既然把你当作知音，将这许多体己话都告诉了你，而且，自从发 生了这桩事，她的名字此刻恐怕早已传了出去，我也就不必再隐瞒下去 了。她的名字是苏菲亚•魏斯顿。”
“Proh deum atque hominum fidem !［46］魏斯顿先生居然有了个成 年的闺女啦！"本杰明说。"可不是，"琼斯大声说，"而且是举世无双的一 位小姐。谁也没见过那么漂亮的人儿。但是姿色还是她次要而又次要的优 点。她有那样卓绝的见识！那样善良的心肠！啊，即使我把她的优点不停 地数下去，也数不到一半！皿魏斯顿先生有个大闺女啦，”理发师大声 说，“我还记得她老子小时候的样子呢。真是Tempus edax rerum四。”
酒已经喝光，理发师殷切地要琼斯再喝一瓶，由他来会钞，但是琼斯 无论如何也不肯，说他已经饮过了量，现在想回到自己的房间去，找本书 看看。“书！"本杰明大声说，“您想看什么书？拉丁文的还是英文的？这两 种文字的有趣味的书，我都有几部。比如伊拉斯谟的《谈荟》四、奥维德的 《悲歌》，还有《诗峰进阶》竺。英文方面我有几部最好的书，虽然有的已 经扯烂了些。斯陀的《编年史》秘大部分我都有。蒲伯译的荷马四我有第六 卷；我有《旁观者》四的第三卷和艾查尔德的《罗马史》急的第二卷；还有 《克拉夫曼》酬、《鲁滨孙漂流记》、托马斯•阿•肯皮斯5］和汤姆•布朗回的 两部作品。”
"后面两卷我从来没见过，"琼斯大声说，"请借我一卷看看。"理发师 保证他读了一定会感到兴味无穷，认为著者是英国作家中最有才华的一
位。本杰明的家就在隔壁，他马上回去把书拿来。琼斯一再叮嘱他一定要 严守秘密。理发师发誓决不泄漏，两个人就分了手。理发师回了家，琼斯 回到他的房间去。

第六章
本杰明先生显示出更多的才能；介绍一下这位非凡人物的来历
第二天早晨，琼斯因为外科大夫丢下他不管，感到有些着慌，怕伤口 不换药不很妥当，甚至会有危险。于是，他向茶房打听附近还有什么大夫 可请。茶房告诉他有个大夫，而且住得也不远；但要是他知道先请过旁的 大夫，后来才再去请他，这位大夫往往会拒绝的。茶房又说："先生，听我 的劝告吧，要治您这伤口，全英国再也找不出比昨天晚上陪您谈天的那位 理发师更合适的大夫了。我们认为他是这一带最会治外伤的人。到这儿虽 然还不上三个月，他已经治好了几件难治的病症。”
茶房马上奉命请小本杰明去。理发师一听是作为大夫来请他的，立刻 就按照这一身份准备停当，来到琼斯的住处。他那神态和外貌却和给人刮 脸时俨然判若两人。
"哦，理发师，"琼斯说，"原来你会不止一种手艺哩。昨晚上你怎么不 告诉我一声啊外科大夫可不是什么手艺，这是一种职业，"本杰明一本 正经地回答说，"昨晚上我所以没告诉您我行医，是因为当时我认定另外一 位大夫正在给您诊治，而我向来不喜欢在同行弟兄正治疗的事情上插手。 Ars omnibus communis.勉但是先生，现在先让我来检查一下您的头 部，然后再提出我的诊断。”
琼斯对这位新大夫信心不大，可他还是让本杰明解开绷带，检查了他 的伤口。看过之后，本杰明立刻就哎哟一声，用力摇了摇头。琼斯带点不 耐烦的神情叫他别大惊小怪，且告诉他伤势怎样了。"请问，我是作为一个 大夫来回答您呢，还是作为一个朋友？"本杰明问道。"作为一个朋友，而 且是认真的，"琼斯说。"那么和您说句老实话，"本杰明大声说，"换过两 三次药以后，要是想不让您完全复原，那倒需要很大的本领呢。只要您肯 用我的软膏，我保您药到病除。"琼斯同意了，于是，伤处就敷上了软膏。
"好啦，先生，"本杰明叫着，"要是您高兴的话，现在我就恢复我的原 来面貌了。行手术的时候脸上不能不保持些尊严，不然的话，世人就不听 摆布了。先生，您想象不到一副严肃的表情对于处理一桩严肃的事务有多 么重要。一个理发师尽可以逗您乐，可是作为外科大夫却应该使您哭。”
"理发师先生，或者说，外科大夫先生，或者说理发师兼外科大夫先 生，”琼斯说。"啊，亲爱的先生！ ”本杰明插嘴说，"Infandum，
regina, jubes renovare dolorem.［竺您这话使我想到，当初这两个行当 本是联合在一起的，如今却残酷地给分开了，分开来对两个行当都不利。 正像古语所说，Vis unita fortiori ；当然，这个或那个行当中都不乏能够 解释这句话的人。我刚好一身兼这两种行当，这是多么不幸呀不管你 喜欢我怎样称呼你，反正你是我生平见到的一个最古怪而又最有风趣的人 物，"琼斯接着说，"在你的经历中一定有些非常惊人的事迹，你总得承认 我有权利要求你来讲给我听听吧。""我承认您有这权利，"本杰明说，"等 您有充分的闲暇，我很乐于讲给您听，那得需要很长一段时间。"琼斯说当 前他就最空闲不过了。"那么我就遵命，”本杰明说，"不过我先得把门扣 上，免得有人来打扰。"他扣上内，然后带着十分庄重的神态朝琼斯走来， 说："先生，我先得告诉您，您就是我一生最大的仇人。"琼斯猛然听到这 话，不免有些吃惊。"我会是你的仇人！"说这话的时候琼斯脸上不但十分 诧异，还带着一些愠恼的神色。"您不要生我的气，"本杰明说，"您放心， 我一定不生您的气的。您自己决没意思想害我，因为当时您还是个娃娃。 可是我相信只要一提我的名字，这个谜就解开了。您难道没听说过一个叫 巴特里奇的人？大家都传说他是您的生父。此人享受了这份光荣，同时也 不幸由于这份光荣而弄得一败涂地。皿我确实听说过巴特里奇，”琼斯 说，"并且一直认为我就是这个人的儿子。""喏，先生，我就是那个巴特里 奇，”本杰明说，"不过，我在这里免除您作为儿子的义务，因为请您相 信，您并不是我的儿子。""怎么回事？”琼斯说，"难道由于一点莫须有的 嫌疑就可能使你遭受我常听人说的那一切恶果吗？ 这是可能的，"本杰明 大声说，"因为事实已经是这样了。尽管人们对于造成他们不幸的原因（即 使是无心的）难免会十分痛恨，然而我却是另一种性情。正像我告诉您 的，自从我听说您对黑乔治的仁举以后，我就一直对您怀着敬爱。由于咱 们这次不平凡的会见，我相信您注定要弥补我为您所遭受到的一切。而 且，在我遇到您的头天晚上，我梦见走路撞在一只折凳上，可是并没伤着 自己。这是我交好运的预兆。昨晚上我又做了一个梦，梦见我骑着一匹乳 白色的母马，跟在您后面。这又是非常吉祥的梦，表示我要走好运。只要 您不至于狠心地拒绝我，我决计不放过这好运。”
"巴特里奇先生，如果我能够尽力弥补上你为我所遭受的一切不幸的 话，"琼斯回答说，"我是很乐于这么办的。不过，眼下我看不出有什么可 能。不管怎样，凡是我力所能及的事，我一定不会拒绝的。”
"您的确办得到，"本杰明说，"因为我只不过要求您让我陪您一道去参 加这次的远征。而且我已经下定了决心，要是您开口拒绝，那您就一下子 既杀死一个理发师，又杀死一个外科大夫了。”
琼斯微笑地回答说，如果由于他而使社会蒙受那么重大的损失，他是 会感到十分遗憾的。然后他就列举了许多理由，说明这样做不妥当，劝阻 本杰明（此后我们就称他为巴特里奇了）不要陪他去远征，但是怎么说也 是徒然。巴特里奇坚决以他那个乳白色母马的梦为根据，决不动摇。"而 且，先生，"他说，"您可以相信，我热中于这桩事业决不下于任何人。不 管您答不答应同我一道去，反正我也是要去的。”
琼斯非常喜欢巴特里奇，正像巴特里奇也非常喜欢他一样。他劝巴特 里奇不要陪他一道去并不是根据他自己的意愿，而是替对方着想。当他看 到这位朋友是如此之坚决，终于也就同意了。随后想到自己的景况，就 说："巴特里奇先生，也许你认为我可以养活你，可是实际上我并没这力 量。"说着他就掏出钱袋来，数了数，一共还有九个基尼。他说，这就是他 的全部家当了。
巴特里奇说，他指望的是琼斯日后对他的好处，他完全相信琼斯不久 就会富足了。"至于眼下，"他说，"我相信我比您还要阔些。但是我所有的 钱您尽管花，您爱怎么花都行。您一定得全部都收下，我只求以仆人身份 陪着您。Nil desperandum est Teucro duce et auspice Teucro.[62]"不 过关于钱财方面，琼斯无论如何也不肯同意巴特里奇所提议的办法。
他们商定第二天早晨出发，可是行李却不好办，因为琼斯先生的衣箱 太大，没有马来驮是不好携带的。
"倘若我可以冒昧出个主意的话，"巴特里奇说，"最好把这只皮箱连同 里边的东西全留在这里，只带上几件衬衣就成了。衬衣我替您拿，很便 当；其余的衣物尽可以锁在我家里。”
这个办法一提出，琼斯立刻就采纳了。于是，理发师先告辞回去一
趟，打点打点，好一同去远征。
第七章
对巴特里奇的举动更合情理的解释;替琼斯的弱点辩护几句;再谈 谈老板娘的一些趣闻
尽管巴特里奇是个迷信透顶的人，恐怕也不会仅仅由于折凳和白母马 的预兆就动念要陪琼斯去远征。他心里所指望的绝不止于分得一些战利 品。事实上，当巴特里奇仔细思量琼斯所告诉他的一切之后，他怎么也无 法相信奥尔华绥先生竟然会因他所听到的这些理由就把自己的亲生子（巴 特里奇坚决相信琼斯是奥尔华绥先生的儿子）逐出内外。因此，他断定琼 斯的话全是信口胡诌的。时常有人写信给他，提到琼斯为人轻率浮躁，实 际上他想必是从他父亲家里逃出来的。巴特里奇想：倘若他能劝这个年轻 人重新回到他父亲那里，必然就在奥尔华绥面前立了一功，这样也许能消 除乡绅以前对他的气恼一一他甚至认为那次乡绅的震怒也是假装出来的， 只是牺牲他以挽救乡绅本人的声誉。从许多迹象上看，巴特里奇都认为自 己这种猜想是不无根据的，诸如乡绅对弃儿的疼爱，和对巴特里奇本人的 苛刻一一巴特里奇晓得自己是无辜的，所以就无法设想旁人会认为他有 罪。最后一点是：自从他那笔津贴公开被取消了很久之后，私下里他一直 还领到一笔年金。巴特里奇把这笔年金看作一种贿赂，或者不如说，作为 乡绅冤屈了他而付的一笔补偿费，因为我深信一般受惠人只要能把施恩者 的举动归之于旁的动机，就很少肯于承认那是纯粹出于一番好心。所以巴 特里奇认为倘若他能想方设法把这位少爷劝回家去，就一定能重获奥尔华 绥的欢心，他的一番苦心准会给他带来重酬一一甚至会让他重新回到故乡 去。可怜巴特里奇思乡之切，竟然超过了尤利西斯。
至于琼斯，他完全把巴特里奇的话信以为实，认为巴特里奇除了对自 己的热爱和对讨伐叛军的热忱之外，别无动机。他不够谨慎，丝毫不去怀 疑旁人可能不诚实，这确是个大可指摘的毛病。老实说，谨慎这种可贵的 品质只有通过两条途径才能取得，一是长期的经验，二是天性；关于后 者，我想往往指的是人的才能或者杰出的禀赋。这远比经验要好得多，因 为我们不但很早就能应用得上，而且它也更加准确可靠。一个人纵使一连 上过许多人的当，也许他依然会希望遇得上更诚实些的人；倘若他内心已 接到必要的警告，说别人也不可能更诚实些，可是竟然还是上了当，这种 人只能说是没什么头脑。琼斯先天不具备这种禀赋，涉世年月又浅，还不
曾从经验阅历中取得这种能力，因为单凭经验阅历来获得这种知所戒备的 智慧，不到晚年是轻易办不到的。有些年纪大的人动辄瞧不起比他们年纪 稍轻些的人们的见解，道理也许就在这里。
琼斯那天大部分时间都是和一位新交一道度过的。这位新交不是旁 人，正是客栈的老板，或者不如说，老板娘的丈夫。他闹了好些日子的痛 风症，新近才下楼。通常一年里他总有半年闹这种病，一闹就出不得房 门。另外六个月就在客栈里东走走西蹭蹭，抽着烟斗，和朋友们饮上几 盅，店里的事一概不过问。他从小就是作为所谓绅士抚养大的，也即是 说，什么也不干。他从一位辛勤务农的舅父那里继承了小小一笔财产，这 笔钱很快就被他在狩猎、赛马和斗鸡上挥霍光了。这位老板娘是抱着某种 希望嫁给他的，可是他早就不能满足她这种希望了。为这件事，老板娘恨 透了他。可是由于他性子暴戾，老板娘也只能满足于不断拿她前夫和他对 比来责怪他一一她对前夫总是赞不绝口。既然客栈赚的钱绝大部分都入了 她的腰包，她也就乐得管理和操持家务了。至于丈夫，经过好些日子的明 争暗斗，她还是管不了他，最后只好任凭他爱怎么便怎么。
晚上，当琼斯回到他自己的房间去之后，这对恩爱夫妻就为着他引起 了-场争论。"怎么，”妻子说，"你又跟那位先生喝起酒来了吧？皿不 错，"丈夫回答说，"我们一道干了一瓶。他的确是个上等人，而且对马很 有研究。当然，他年纪还轻，阅历有限，我估计他没去过几次赛马 会。""哦嗬，这么说来他是你的同道喽，"老板娘说，"要是他也赛马，就 准是个上等人！让魔鬼把这种上等人抓走吧。对我来说，最好一辈子也别 遇上一个。我倒真有理由去爱上一个骑师哩你有理由，"丈夫说，"因 为你晓得我就是个骑师。皿是呀，”她回答说，"可不是个地地道道的骑 师。正像我前夫经常说的，我可以把我从你身上得到的好处全装在我眼睛 里，永远也别去看你的坏处。""去你妈的前夫！"他大声说。"他比你强多 了，你不配骂他，"妻子回答说，"他要是还在世，你就决不敢。""你以为 我没你那份胆量，"他说，"我就多次亲耳听到你骂过他。""要是我骂过他 的话，"她说，"我已经懊悔过多少遍了。如果他已经宽宏大量地原谅了我 在忙乱中说出的一句半句，也用不着像你这样的东西来讥谓我。他是我的 男人，一个真正的男人；要是我一时犯性子，骂过他什么，我也从没骂过 他无赖一一要是我真那么骂过的话，我说的也不是实话。"她还说了许多旁
的话，他都没听见，他燃上烟斗，尽快地踉跄走开了。我们这里也就不往 下记录她的话了，因为她越说越接近一个粗鄙得不便写入本书的题目了。
第二天大早，巴特里奇来到了琼斯的床边。他背上个背包，准备登 程。这背包是他自己做的。除了那两个行当之外，他的裁缝手艺也颇不 坏。他已经把自己的全部贴身衣裳都装进背包里，共有四件衬衫，如今又 加上琼斯先生的八件。然后他把那只衣箱打点好，准备把它送回家去。这 时，老板娘迎头把他拦住，说没结完账之前什么也不许搬。
前面我们已经交代过，在客栈这个范围内，老板娘是说一不二的主 宰，所以只能按照她的规定办事。于是账单开出来了，从钱数上看，大大 超过了琼斯在食宿方面所享受的接待。这里，我们不得不揭开旅店老板们 奉为本行无上秘诀的一些金科玉律。第一，倘若旅馆里有些上等食品（这 诚然是罕见的），只有遇到行囊阔绰的旅客上门时才可拿出来。第二，对 这种客人，供应他们最劣等的饭菜，照最优等的算钱。最后一点是，倘若 哪位客人要的菜很少，就让他们付双倍的钱，这样，每个客人所付的钱就 可以相差无几了。
账单开来并且付清之后，琼斯就和背着那个背包的巴特里奇上路了。 那个老板娘甚至不屑祝他一声平安。看来这是一家专供上等人出入的客 栈。我也说不清道理何在，但是一切靠上等人谋生的人对其他阶层总怀着 莫大轻蔑，真像他们自己也属于上流社会似的。
第八章
琼斯来到格洛斯特，走进钟铃客栈;这家客栈的特点，以及在那里 遇到的一个讼棍的行径
琼斯先生和巴特里奇（或名小本杰明，这个"小"字也许是作为反话而 加上去的，因为实际上他身高几达六叭）就像上述那样离开了那家客栈， 直奔格洛斯特而来，—路上没遇到什么值得—叙的事情。
到了格洛斯特城，他们就挑定了门前挂着钟铃招牌的一家客栈歇宿。 这确实是个极好的旅店，我谨向每一位想到该城游览的读者竭诚推荐。东 家是当今大传道士怀特菲尔德急之弟，但是此人丝毫也没受到卫理公会或任 何其他旁门左道的熏染。他是一位非常纯朴的老实人，依我看，不大会在 教堂或政府里惹是生非。我相信他的妻子当年一定说得上是个美人，现在 她仍然十分端丽。以她的姿容和风度，就是站在名门闺秀中间也必然会很 出色的。尽管她也必然意识到自己的美貌和其他可贵之处，然而她好像完 全安于目前的生活，感到心满意足。这种乐天知命纯粹出于她天性的谨慎 自重和知情达理。眼下，她同她丈夫一样，也没受到卫理公会的影响一一 我说眼下，因为她坦率承认最初看了大伯子所写的那些东西，也受过些感 动，她甚至还置备了一条长头巾，等待着圣灵的感召。可是试了三个星 期，任什么圣灵也没光临，她就很明智地丢开那条头巾，再也不信奉那个 教派了。简而言之，她是一位十分亲切、和蔼的女人，热心为人效劳。倘 若有人来她这家客栈投宿却感到不甚满意，这人一定是过于吹毛求疵，难 伺候。
琼斯和他的同伴走进客栈的时候，怀特菲尔德太太刚好在庭院里。她 那一双慧眼立刻在我们的主人公身上发见了某种不同凡响的东西。因此， 她吩咐伙计们马上把他引到一个房间里，接着就请琼斯跟她一道用饭。琼 斯十分感激地接受了这个邀请，因为肚皮饿了老半天，又走了这么远的一 程路，就是没有像怀特菲尔德太太这样称意的主人，没有这样可口的饭 菜，他也会乐于接受的。
同席的除了琼斯和这家客栈的贤主妇，还有索尔兹伯里的一位律师 ――就是给奥尔华绥先生带来布利非太太噩耗的那位；当时我大概没提他 的名字，他叫道林。桌上还有一个人，自称是个律师，住在萨默塞特郡的 灵林赤附近。我说这家伙自称是个律师，其实他只不过是个最卑鄙的讼
棍，既没有学识又没有见解，可以说是司法界的一名走卒。这种人是这一 行业里的累赘，专门替律师们当听差，为了挣上半个克朗，他肯跑的路程 比邮差肯跑的还要远。
席间，那个萨默塞特郡的律师记起在奥尔华绥先生家里见过琼斯的 面，因为他时常光顾那位乡绅的厨房。于是就乘机问候起这个好家庭，语 气之亲切真像是奥尔华绥先生的一位挚友或相识。尽管他在乡绅家里从来 也没跟比管家地位更高的人谈过话，他却竭力暗示自己和他家有交情。琼 斯怎么也记不起曾经见过这个讼棍，并且从那人的外表和举止断定他是在 冒充上等人，然而他还是彬彬有礼地回答了所有的问题。
任何有见识的人和这种人谈话总是感到厌恶的，所以一吃完饭，琼斯 马上就辞出，忍心丢下可怜的怀特菲尔德太太来受罪；我时常听提摩西•哈 利斯先生以及其他一些有教养的旅店主人慨叹说，干他们这一行业最倒霉 的事就是不得不陪着旅客闲坐。
琼斯刚一走出房间，那个讼棍就小声问怀特菲尔德太太，她可认得这 个翩翩公子是谁。她说，以前一次也没见过这位绅士。"绅士，说得可 好！"讼棍说，"真是个漂亮绅士 ！哼，其实，他是个私生子，他老子为了 偷人家的马给绞死了。有人把他丢在奥尔华绥乡绅的门口，后来宅里一个 底下人发现他给装在一个积满了雨水的匣子里。要不是老天爷要他尝尝另 —种命运，早就给淹死了。"道林极其滑稽地笑了笑，嚷道："唉，唉，你 用不着说，我们很清楚那是怎样一种命运。皿那时乡绅就吩咐把他弄进 去，"讼棍继续说下去，"因为他是个出名的胆小鬼，生怕自己惹出是非。 这私生子就在宅里抚养成人，衣食都像个体面的绅士。可是他姘上了个女 用人，让她怀了孕，并且唆使她一口咬定胎儿是乡绅的。后来这个私生子 又打断了一个牧师屠瓦孔先生的胳膊，只因为这位牧师责备他不该跟些烂 女人去鬼混。他后来又从背后给了布利非少爷一枪。有一回奥尔华绥生了 病，他弄来一只鼓，在宅里到处乱敲，故意不让乡绅睡觉。他还干了其他 数不尽的坏事，终于在四五天以前，就在我刚要离开那里的时候，就为这 些事乡绅把他剥得赤条条的，赶出了大门。”
"正该如此！"道林大声说，"即使是我自己的儿子，要是他犯了一半这 种罪过，我也一定会把他赶出去。请问，这位漂亮少爷叫什么名字？"
"这小子的名字？”讼棍说，"他叫托马斯•琼斯呀。”
"琼斯！"道林带着点儿热切的语气说，"跟咱们一道吃饭的那位难道就 是住在奥尔华绥先生家的琼斯先生吗正是他，"讼棍说。"我时常听人 谈起过这位少爷，可是从来也没听到过他的什么坏话，"道林大声说。"是 呀，"怀特菲尔德太太说，"要是这位先生说的话有一半是真的，那么琼斯 先生就是我一辈子见到的人中间最会装假的了，因为看他那神情跟您说的 完全不是一个人。我得承认，凭着我对他的那点观察，我觉得他有礼貌， 有教养，使人乐于和他往来。”
讼棍想起他没像往常那样在作证词以前先发誓，于是就赌了一串咒。 老板娘一听吓了一大跳，她连声说一定相信他所讲的一切，讼棍才不再赌 咒了。然后他说："太太，请您相信，如果我不是确实有把握，我决不肯去 揭人的这种阴私的。破坏一个从没损害过我的人的名声，对我有什么好处 呢？我向您担保，我说的句句都是实话，那一带没有人不晓得的。”
既然怀特菲尔德太太没有理由怀疑讼棍存有什么歹心，故意来诽谤琼 斯，况且他又一连起了许多誓，读者也就不能怪她把讼棍的话全信以为真 了。于是，她放弃了自己从相貌上看人的本领，从此对这个客人+分反 感，恨不得他马上离去。
这时怀特菲尔德先生从厨房里得来的消息更加深了老板娘对琼斯的憎 恶。巴特里奇在厨房里告诉大家说，尽管行囊由他背着，当汤姆•琼斯（他 就是这样称呼的）在客厅里欢宴的时候，他情愿跟底下人在一起厮混，然 而他可并不是琼斯的仆人，只是个朋友或旅伴。他自己也是个绅士，身份 一点儿也不比琼斯低。
道林一直坐在那里一语不发，咬着指甲，做着鬼脸，龇着牙齿，样子 看来十分狡猾。最后他才开了口，说这位绅士倒完全像另一种人。说完之 后，他就赶忙催着算账，说他当晚还得到赫里福德四去。他慨叹说，事务太 忙了，他恨不得自己会分身法，能同时去二十个地方。
讼棍随后也走了。这时琼斯请怀特菲尔德太太赏光，同他一道喝茶， 可是她拒绝了，而且神态和吃饭的时候大大不同，这使他有些惊讶。过不 久他看出怀特菲尔德太太的态度完全改变了。前面我们所称赞的亲切、和 蔼顿时不见了，她脸上显出勉强忍耐的严峻神色。这使得琼斯先生很不痛 快，不管天色多么晚，他也决计当天就离开这家客栈。
琼斯对老板娘突然改变态度的解释可不大公平。除掉刻薄而冤枉地归 之于女人家的喜怒无常之外，他还怀疑对方礼数的短缺是因为他自己缺少
马匹；这种畜生脏不着旅馆的被褥，所以店家通常认为是比骑马的人油水 更大的主顾，因而也比人更受欢迎。其实，平心而论，怀特菲尔德太太的 思想方法比那要开阔多了。她受过很好的教养，能够对上流客人很有礼 貌，即使是步行而来的。实际上，她把我们的主人公当成了一个落魄的无 赖汉，所以才如此怠慢他。倘若琼斯本人了解得有读者那么多，他也不会 去责怪老板娘了。恰恰相反，他还一定会称赞她的做法，因为她怠慢自己 而更加敬重她。当一个人晓得自己声名扫地的时候，他就没理由生那些轻 蔑他、怠慢他的人的气。无端地诽谤人的名誉就会使其处于最难堪的境 地。除非是很亲近的朋友由于了解甚深，应该知道他的坏名声是出于捏 造，是有人恶意散布的，否则，对那些佯作友善和自己来往的人还应嗤之 以鼻哩。
然而琼斯的情况并不是这样。既然完全不晓得事情的底细，他就有理 由对这种怠慢感到气恼。因此，他付清账就走了，尽管这样做大大违反巴 特里奇先生的心意。巴特里奇竭力反对也没用，最后只好背上行囊跟他的 朋友一道上路。
第九章
琼斯和巴特里奇之间的几段关于爱情、寒冷、饥饿及其他事情的谈 话；巴特里奇幸而及时煞住，没向琼斯泄露出一个性命攸关的秘密
高山的阴影开始向地面展开，所有的鸟儿都已倦飞还巢。上等人正入 席欢宴，下等人则坐下来用他们的晚餐。一句话，琼斯先生离开格洛斯特 的时候，时钟正敲五下。这是隆冬时分，倘若不是有月光来阻挡，夜早已 用它那肮脏的指头拉过黑色幕幔把宇宙遮盖上了。这时月亮正带着一副和 她一样昼寝夜出的那些快活人儿的又圆又红的面孔，从床上爬起；她沉沉 睡了一天，为的是好坐个通宵达旦。琼斯没走出多远，就对天空这美丽的 星球称赞起来。然后转过身来问他的旅伴可曾见过如此美妙的夜色。巴特 里奇对这问题一时回答不出，琼斯就又谈起月色的美，并且背诵了几段弥 尔顿的诗；在描绘天体方面，弥尔顿确实高于所有的诗人。随后，他给巴 特里奇讲了《旁观者》杂志上的一个故事：有一对情人天各一方，他们约 好在指定的时刻各自到一个地方去眺望月亮，这样在精神上保持联系。两 人想到同时都在对同一天体出神，便会感到无限欢畅。琼斯还说："这样的 情人，他们的心灵一定真正能体会到人类情感中最崇高的情意。""很可能 是这样，"巴特里奇大声说，"不过，要是他们身子不觉得寒冷，我就会更 加羡慕他们，因为我差不多快冻死了，恐怕走不到下一家客栈，我的鼻子 就会给冻掉一块啦。真的，这么深更半夜，咱们竟从我生平到过的一家最 完美的客栈里跑出来，干了这么件蠢事，老天爷决不会饶咱们的。我敢 说，我一辈子还没见过这么多考究的东西，便是全国最阔气的贵族在他的 府邸里过的生活也不会比那家客栈更豪华。如今咱们丢开那样好的地方， 却在野地里这么瞎撞，天晓得咱们会撞到哪儿去。Per devia rura viarum快我自己是无所谓的，可是有些人不会那么客气，也许认为咱们发 了疯呢。""嗨，巴特里奇先生，拿出些勇气来，"琼斯说；"想想看，你还 要去打敌人哪，难道能叫小小的一点寒冷吓住？可惜咱们没个向导来指引 究竟该走哪条路。""我可以贡献点拙见吗？”巴特里奇说，“Interdum stultus opportuna loquitur.倒”"那么你说该走哪条路呢？”琼斯大声 说。“说实在的，两条路都走不得，”巴特里奇回答说，“唯一走得通的就是 咱们来的那条路。要是咱们迈开大步，约莫一个钟头就可以回到格洛斯特 城里。倘若还往前走的话，鬼晓得咱们什么时候才会走到个歇脚的地方，
因为我一眼至少看出五十哩去，前面连一所房子也没有。""那么你一定看 到一片极美的景色了，"琼斯说，"月光这么灿烂，景色一定更加美丽了。 不过我决定顺左边这条路走，看来这条路直通那道山，听说沃斯特城离那 儿就不远啦。现在如果你有意跟我分手，你尽可以重新回到格洛斯特去。 至于我自己，我决心继续往前走。”
"先生，您怀疑我有这种想法，未免太不友善了，"巴特里奇说，"我所 想的办法是为了咱们都好。不过，既然您拿定主意要走下去，我也一定奉 陪。I prae sequar te.回”
他们又走了几哩地，彼此没有交谈。一路上琼斯常常叹息，本杰明也 同样痛苦地呻吟，理由当然大不相同。最后，琼斯突然停下脚步，转过身 来大声说："巴特里奇，说不定宇宙间那个最可爱的人儿此刻眼睛也在凝望 我正看着的这个月亮哩。""很可能是这样，先生，"巴特里奇回答说，"但 是如果我的眼睛能凝视着一盘香喷喷的烤牛腰肉，月亮尽可以让魔鬼拿 去，连那对椅角网也可以搭上。皿看你说得多么粗鄙呀，”琼斯大声 说，"请问，巴特里奇，难道你一辈子就没尝过爱情的滋味吗？还是时光把 你记忆里一切爱情的痕迹都冲刷得一干二净了呢？皿唉！ ”巴特里奇嚷 道，“要是我从来也不晓得爱情是什么滋味，那倒好啦。Infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem.回我敢说自己也尝过爱情所有的酸甜苦 辣。""那么你的妻子对你凶狠吗？”琼斯说。"凶狠之极啊，先生，"巴特里 奇答道，"嫁了我以后，她成了世上顶要不得的老婆啦。谢天谢地，如今她 已经去世啦。我曾经看过一本书上说，月亮是收容阴魂的地方。要是我相 信她在那里的话，我就再也不敢望望月亮了，我怕瞅见她。可是为了您的 缘故，先生，我倒巴不得月亮是面镜子，而苏菲亚•魏斯顿小姐这时正在照 镜子。""亲爱的巴特里奇，"琼斯大声说，"你这个想法太美妙了。我相信 这只有情人的脑子里才想得出。啊，巴特里奇，我多么希望再望一眼她的 脸呀！可是，咳，所有这些金色的梦都永远消逝了，而唯一可以免除日后 一切痛苦的办法就是忘却那个曾经给过我一切幸福的人。""您真的认为没 有希望再和魏斯顿小姐见面了吗？ ”巴特里奇说，"要是您按照我的主意 办，我可以担保您不但能和她见面，而且可以把她抱在怀里。""啊，可别 往这种想头上引我，”琼斯大声说，"我好不容易才断了这种念 头。""不，”巴特里奇回答说，"要是您并不想把您的姑娘抱在怀里，那才 是顶特别的情人哩。""得啦，得啦，咱们别谈这个题目啦，"琼斯说，"不
过，请问你有什么主意呀？”"咱们既然是军人，我就用军队的话来说，"巴 特里奇说，"那就是：向后转！回到刚才那个地方去。尽管天已经很晚了， 可是今夜咱们还能走到格洛斯特。但是如果咱们往前走的话，依我看来， 走一辈子恐怕也碰不上客栈或者人家。""我已经告诉你了，我决心往前 走，"琼斯回答说，"不过，我倒要你回去。承你陪我走了一程路，请你收 下这一个基尼，作为我的一点谢意。不，如果再让你跟我走下去，我就太 残忍了。跟你打开天窗说亮话吧，我此去主要的目的和愿望就是为国王和 祖国而光荣地捐躯。皿说到您的钱，还是请您收回去吧，”巴特里奇 说，"眼下我不收您一个钱，因为我相信现在我比您还要阔一些。您既然下 定决心要往前走，那么我的决心就是跟随您。尤其您既然抱了这种激烈的 想法，看来我就非留在您身边照应您不可了。您可以相信，我的看法比您 的要稳重多了，正像您打定主意要阵亡，我下定决心尽量不让自己受一点 伤。而且我还有个聊以自慰的想法：此去是不会有多大风险的，因为有个 天主教的神父那天告诉我说，事情没几天就可以过去了，他认为一仗也用 不着打。""一个天主教神父！"琼斯大声说，"据说这种人替他们信奉的宗 教说起话来，往往是靠不住的。""对，"巴特里奇回答说，"可是他不但没 替他的宗教说什么话，还一再要我相信，天主教徒不会从这次变革里得到 什么好处，因为查理王子囹像所有的英国人一样，也是个虔诚的新教徒，只 是为了拥护王位的合法权利，才使他和别的一些天主教徒成了雅各宾派 四。皿要是我相信他是新教徒的话，我也就相信他有权利继承王位了，"琼 斯说，"而且我毫不怀疑咱们一定会把他击败；不过势必要打一场仗。所以 我没有你那位天主教神父朋友那么乐观。""先生，不但这样，"巴特里奇 说，"我所读过的一切预言书都说这场争吵将要使血流如注，说如今还活着 的生着三个拇指的磨坊主人将要替三位国王牵马，血水将深及他的膝盖。
啊，老天爷大慈大悲，给咱们点太平日子吧。""你满脑子什么乱七八糟的 呀，"琼斯说，"你这也是从天主教神父那里听来的吧。这些妖魔鬼怪正好 给他们那些异端邪说拿来作根据。国王乔治四所主张的是自由和真正的宗 教，也即是理性。伙计，纵使布莱阿柔斯口再世，仍然生着那一百个拇指， 并且变成为一个磨坊主人，咱们也一定会胜利。"巴特里奇没有搭腔。老实 说，琼斯的话使他陷入极度惶恐中。有个秘密过去一直没有机会告诉读 者，现在说了吧：巴特里奇其实是个雅各宾派，他原以为琼斯也是他的同 党，如今正前往去参加叛军的。他怀有这个想法也是不无根据的，因为
《虎迪布拉斯》中曾提到过的那个身高胁长的妇女四一一或者说维吉尔笔下 的那个多眼、多舌、多口、多耳的妖怪猝已经按照她平素对真实性的尊重， 叙述了琼斯和军官吵架的原委。她竟然把苏菲亚的名字换成了那位王位觊 觎者也，说琼斯就是为了举杯遥祝这个人而被打伤的。这话给巴特里奇听到 了，他坚信不疑。因此，难怪他对琼斯怀有上述那种想法，并且还在觉察 自己弄错之前，几乎向琼斯明白说出。倘若读者追忆一下琼斯第一次向巴 特里奇表示自己的决心时措词确有些模棱两可，也就更不足为奇了。其 实，即使琼斯的话说得再明确一些，恐怕巴特里奇也仍然会做那样的解 释，因为他深深相信全国人民内心都和他一个想法，而尽管琼斯是和军队 一道走，也不曾使他这种估计稍有动摇，因为他对军队的看法与对平民的 看法并无两样。
然而不管他对詹姆斯或是查理也多么倾心，他更关怀的还是他小本杰明 本人。因此，他一发觉这位旅伴的志趣所在之后，立刻认为既然指望依靠 琼斯来发迹，就理应把自己的志趣隐瞒起来，表面上装作已经捐弃掉；因 为他一直不相信琼斯和奥尔华绥先生的关系业已破裂到无可挽回的地步。 巴特里奇自从离开那一带，一直和某些邻居通信，他听到许多关于奥尔华 绥先生如何钟爱这个年轻人的话，有些其实是过甚其词。他们告诉巴特里 奇说，琼斯将要成为那位乡绅的财产继承人，而前面已经交代过，巴特里 奇一直深信琼斯是奥尔华绥先生的儿子。
因此，他估量不论他们之间发生过怎样的争吵，只要琼斯先生一回 去，必然就可以言归于好；如果眼下乘机尽力巴结这位少爷，一旦他们父 子和解了，巴特里奇估计对自己也一定会大有好处的。我们前面已经说 过，巴特里奇认为只要能设法把琼斯劝回家去，他就会大大得到奥尔华绥 先生的恩宠。
我们已经说过巴特里奇是个厚道人，他自己也表明对琼斯和他的为人 万分钦佩；然而刚才我谈到的巴特里奇对前途所抱的那种希望，很可能在 促使他参加这趟远征上也起了不小的作用，尤其当他发现自己和这位少爷 虽然犹如稳重的父子俩，亲密地一道旅行，却分别属于敌对的两个党派以 后。我们所以会这样猜测，是因为注意到，尽管爱情、友谊、尊崇等等在 人的心灵上有着强大的作用，可是当聪明人想让旁人为自己的目的服务 时，利益这个因素很少不被考虑进去。利益确实是一服极好的药，就像瓦
德万应丸也一样，服下去药力立刻就奔向你要它发生作用的地方，不论是舌 头、手还是其他部分，登时见效，几乎是万无一失的。
第十章
两位行路人的一桩奇遇
琼斯和他的朋友谈完上一章那段话之后，就来到一座高山的脚下。琼 斯突然停下来，抬头朝上望着，沉默地伫立了一阵。最后，他招呼同伴 说："巴特里奇，我很想爬到山顶上去。尤其在月下，那里的景物一定更加 壮丽，一草一木都罩上了庄严朦胧的月色，对一个想抒发忧思的人，必然 更是美得无法形容。""很可能是这样，"巴特里奇说，"不过既然山顶最宜 于抒发忧思，那么山脚一定最能产生快乐的想头。这两者之间，我是宁要 快乐的想头的。一听您说要到山顶上去，我就凉了半截。在我看来，那就 是世界上最高的山峰了。不，不，要是有必要找个地方的话，还是向洼处 找吧，洼处可以避避寒气。""你自己找去吧，"琼斯说，"可是别走出听不 见喊叫的范围，我回来好招呼你。""先生，您莫非发了疯吧！"巴特里奇 说。"要是爬上山顶就算发疯的话，那我就是发疯了，"琼斯回答说，"既然 你已经抱怨太冷了，就留在山底下吧，我不出一个钟头准回来。""先生， 请原谅我，"巴特里奇大声说，"我已经下定决心，您走到哪儿，我就跟到 哪儿。"他确实不敢这时留下来。虽然他什么都怕，然而他此刻主要怕的是 鬼。深更半夜，又在这样的荒山野地里，最适宜鬼怪出没了。
这当儿，巴特里奇瞥见树丛中闪烁着一道微弱的光亮，似乎离他们很 近。他马上狂喜地嚷道："啊，先生，上天终于听到了我的祈祷，把咱们领 到一所房子旁边来，也许是一家客栈呢。先生，如果您对我或者对您自己 还有一点点慈悲的话，我求您不要辜负上天这番好意，咱们就直奔那个亮 处去吧。不管它是不是一家客店，里面只要住着基督教徒，看到咱们这样 处在困境中的人，我相信一定不会不给咱们一席之地的。"巴特里奇苦苦哀 求，琼斯终于首肯了。两人就直奔那个发出光亮的地方而去。
不大工夫，他们就来到那所房子或者茅舍跟前一一两种称呼都无不 可。琼斯连敲了几下门，里边都没人答应。巴特里奇满脑袋都是妖魔鬼怪 和巫婆一类的东西，这时就哆哆嗦嗦地嚷道："上帝啊，发发慈悲吧！里面 的人准都死了。眼下什么光亮也看不见啦，可是刚才我确实看到一支蜡烛 点在那里。对，这类怪事儿我可听说过。皿你听说过些什么？ ”琼斯 说，"里面的人不是睡得太熟了，就是因为这地方太偏僻，不敢开门。”于 是，他又大声喊了一通，最后，一个老妪打开门上的一个小窗，问外面是
谁，有什么事。琼斯回答说他们是迷路的旅客，看到了窗口的光亮，想进 来烤烤火，暖和暖和。"不管你们是谁，别来给我们找麻烦，"那个老妪大 声说，"这么深更半夜的，谁来我也不给开门。"巴特里奇听到人声，就不 那么害怕了。他苦苦央求让他们进去烤几分钟的火，说他快要冷死啦。他 的冷，一半自然由于严寒，一半也由于恐惧。他要老妪相信，刚才和她交 谈的这位是本地一位极有名望的乡绅。所有可以用来说服她的话巴特里奇 都说尽了，可是有一句特别有灵效的话他却没说，后来琼斯给补充了：那 就是答应给她半个克朗。像她这样一个人是无法拒绝这么一笔重贿的，尤 其是老妪借着月光清清楚楚地看到琼斯那文雅的外表以及和蔼可亲的举 止，于是最初怀疑他们是强盗的想法早已完全消除了。终于，她同意让他 们进去。房里这时正烧着一炉好火，巴特里奇自是无比欢喜。
可是这个可怜的家伙刚刚暖和过来，心坎上时刻不忘的那个想头又使 他惶恐不安起来。此人最信的莫如巫术，而读者也很难设想还有谁能比如 今站在跟前的这位老妪更容易使他联想到巫术的；她的确活像奥特韦在 《孤儿》四里描绘的那个形象。老实说，这老妪倘若活在詹姆斯一世也的时 代，光凭她那副模样，几乎不需要任何罪证，就可以把她送上绞刑架了。
另外还有许多情况也都好像有意促使巴特里奇把她看作巫婆。她独自 （巴特里奇这么以为）住在这么孤寂的一个地方；住的这所房子从外面看 对她来说似乎已经太好了，而室内的陈设就更是极为雅致整洁。说实在 的，琼斯看了也颇为惊讶，因为不但房里的安排异常齐整，而且还摆着大 批足以引起鉴赏家注目的珍宝古玩。
当琼斯在欣赏这些东西的时候，巴特里奇却坐在那里浑身颤抖，认定 他是走进巫婆家了。那位老妪说："先生，希望你们快点儿烤烤就走，因为 我家主人马上就要回来了，就是给我双倍钱，我也决不愿意让他在这儿撞 上你们。""这么说来你还有个主人哪！"琼斯大声说，"对不起，老太太， 我正奇怪屋子里怎么摆着这么好的陈设呢。""哎，先生，"她说，"要是二 十件里有一件是我的，我就是个阔婆子啦。可是，先生，您别耽搁太久 了，他随时都会回来的。""你做的是一件很寻常的好事，难道他会生你的 气唉，先生，"她说，"他是个怪人，跟平常人两样。他不同人往来， 除了夜晚，很少出门，因为他不愿意叫人见到。这一带的人也怕碰上他， 单单他那副打扮就会把没见惯他的人吓着。大家管他叫'山中人'，因为他总 是夜晚到山那边散步。我相信这一带的人对他害怕得不下于魔鬼。他要是
在这儿撞上你们，一定会十分生气的。""先生，咱们可别惹这位老爷生 气，"巴特里奇说，"我可以上路啦。一辈子也没像现在这么暖和过。我央 求您，先生，咱们动身吧。瞧，烟囱上还摆着手枪呢，谁知道里头上没上 子弹，指不定他会拿它干出什么事来呢！""巴特里奇，什么也用不着 怕，"琼斯大声说，"有什么危险，我来保护你。""这您倒用不着担心，他 从来也不伤害人，"老妪说，"不过他不能不预备几件家伙来自卫。他这家 给骚扰过不止一次啦。仅仅几天前的一个晚上，我们好像还听见有贼来过 哩。他总是这么晚一个人出去散步，居然没给什么歹人害死，我还时常纳 闷哩。但是我刚才说过，大家都害怕他，并且也许认为他身上没什么值得 抢的。""从他收藏的古玩看来，"琼斯大声说，"你的主人大概游历过不少 地方吧。""先生，是这样，"老妪回答说，"他走遍了天下，见识像他那么 广的人可没几个。我猜想他也许失恋过，要不就是遭到了旁的什么事故； 反正我跟他一道生活了三+多年，这么些年来他统共也没和六个人说过 话。"接着，她又央求他们快点离开，巴特里奇也从旁附和，可是琼斯故意 拖延时间，他的好奇心大发，很想会会这位不同寻常的人物。因此，尽管 老妪每次回答完他的话都催他快些动身，巴特里奇甚至还扯他的衣袖，可 是他不断地找话问她，直到老妇人惊慌失色地说，她已经听见主人的信号 了。就在这时，他们听见门外不止一个人嚷着："该死的，立刻把钱拿出 来。拿钱，混账，不然就要你的狗命！ ”
"哎呀，我的天！"老妪嚷道，"准是有歹人来欺负我主人啦。哎，这可 怎么好！这可怎么好呀！""怎么啦？"琼斯大声说，"怎么啦？这些手枪装 着子弹吗啊，好先生，里头真的什么也没装。哎呀，先生，请饶我们 的命吧！"（原来这时她把屋里两个人当作跟外面强盗是一伙的了。）琼斯 没答理他，可是抄起房里挂的一把宽刃旧大刀，就立即冲出门去。但见那 位老先生正跟两个强盗在死命挣扎，一面苦苦向他们哀求。琼斯一句话不 说就挥起大刀扑将过去。两个强盗见势立刻松开手，不敢和我们的主人公 较量，赶快拔腿就跑。琼斯救了老人就已满足，并没去追赶歹徒。其实， 他算计已经把他们打得够戗了，两个家伙一边跑，一边还叫死叫活的。
老人在厮打时候栽倒在地。琼斯登时上前把他扶起来，表示十分关 切，问强盗可曾打伤了他。老人凝眸望了望琼斯，然后大声说："先生，我 没伤着，没伤着。谢谢您，我没受什么伤。老天爷可怜可怜我吧！""先 生，"琼斯说，"看来您甚至对有幸营救了您的人也还怀着畏惧。我不能怪
您有这种顾虑；不过，现在您实在用不着担心，这里都是您的朋友。我们 是在寒夜里走迷了路，冒昧地借您府上的火暖和一下。刚要动身，就听到 您呼救。只能说，救您的是天意。""天意，真的！"老人嚷道，"但愿如 此。""您可以相信，确实是这样，"琼斯大声说，"先生，这是您的刀。我 曾用它来保护您，现在仍然还给您。"老人接了过来，上面还沾着他敌人的 血。他定睛望了琼斯一阵，然后长叹了一口气大声说："年轻的绅士，请原 谅我。我并不是一向多疑成性的，也决不是那种忘恩负义的人。”
"那么就请感谢上天吧，"琼斯嚷道，"是上天搭救您的。至于我，只不 过尽一个同类应尽的极寻常的义务罢了。遇到任何同一处境的人，我也会 同样营救的。""让我仔细看看您，"老人叫着说，"那您也是个凡人？嗯， 也许是。请到我这茅舍里坐坐吧，您真是我的救命恩人。”
那老妪为两种恐惧而莫知所措，一方面害怕她的主人，同时，又为她 的主人而害怕。巴特里奇甚至比她还要害怕。老妪听到主人跟琼斯亲切地 攀谈，看清情况后，心绪也就镇定下来了。而巴特里奇最初因听到老妪怪 诞的描绘，后来又由于门外骚动的声音，本已吓了一跳；现在看到那位老 人的奇怪打扮，这个可怜的家伙就更加害怕起来。
老实说，他那样子就是比巴特里奇先生胆子再壮些的人见了，也会有 几分害怕的。他的身材十分高大，长长的胡子白得像雪。身穿一件驴皮缝 成的外衣，腿上的长靴和头上的帽子全是另一些兽皮缝成的。
老人一走进来，老妪马上祝贺他从歹人手里侥幸脱险。"是呀，脱了 险，"老人大声说，"真得好好谢谢这位救命恩人。皿啊，愿上帝赐福给 他！"老妪说，"我敢担保他是一位高贵的先生。我本来怕老爷会怪我让他 进来。我要不是趁着月光看出他是一位上等人，而且快要冻死，我也决不 会让他进来的。准是仁慈的天使把他送到咱们门口，诱使我把他放进来 的。”
"先生，"老人对琼斯说，"我家里恐怕没什么可以招待您的，除非您肯 喝一杯白兰地酒；我倒有点极好的白兰地酒，藏了三十年啦。"琼斯恭敬而 得体地辞谢了。随后，老人问他迷路的时候，正要到什么地方去，并且 说："实在说来，以您这样的仪表，竟然深更半夜徒步行路，我感到十分惊 讶。我猜想您是这一带的绅士，因为您不像习惯于不骑马走远路的人。”
"外表往往是不可靠的，"琼斯大声说，"有时候人的样子和本人并不相 符。请相信，我不是这一带的人。至于我到哪里去，老实说，连我自己也
不晓得。”
"不管您是谁，要到哪里去，"老人说，"反正我欠下您的情是永远难以 报答的。”
"我再着重说一遍，"琼斯回答说，"您并不欠我什么情。我对生命并不 看重，而帮您忙的时候，我冒的只不过是生命的危险，所以算不得什么。 在我看来，世上再没有比生命更没价值的了。”
"年轻的绅士，"那位陌生人说，"您这般年纪为什么竟会这样苦恼，我 实在为您难过！”
"先生，"琼斯回答说，"我确实是人类中最不幸的人。""您也许有过一 个朋友，或是一位情人吧？”对方说。"先生！"琼斯嚷道，"您怎么偏偏说 出这两个足以使我发疯的词儿来呢！""这两个词儿哪一个都足以使任何人 发疯，"老人回答说，"先生，我不再问下去啦；也许由于好奇，我已经问 得太多了。”
"不，先生，"琼斯大声说，"我不能责备您好奇，我此刻也正感到强烈 的好奇呢。对不起，先生，自从我走进您府上，一切所见所闻都引起我最 大的好奇心。想必是发生过很不寻常的事，才使您过这样的生活。我有理 由担心您自己过去也遭遇过不幸。”
这时，老人又长叹了一声，沉默了好几分钟，最后恳切地望了望琼斯 说："我曾经读到过，说一副善良的相貌就是一封推荐书。如果真是这样， 那么从来没有人得到比您更好的推荐。另外还有个原因使我对您起了思慕 之情，不然的话，我就是世上一个最不知感恩的怪物了。我真是遗憾，除 了话语以外，我再也没有旁的办法来使您相信我对您的感激。”
琼斯沉吟了片刻，回答说："用话语尽可以使我十分高兴。先生，我已 经告诉您我是多么好奇。倘若您肯于满足我的好奇心，我自是感激不尽。 除非您有难言之隐，不然的话，可否请您告诉我是什么东西促使您从人类 社会隐退出来，过着这种显然不是您生来就过着的生活呢？"
"承您救我一命，"老人回答说，"我认为您的任何要求我都不能拒绝。 如果您想了解一个不幸者的生涯，我就讲给您听听。您估量得很对，遁世 的人一生往往都经历过一些不寻常的变故。不管看来是多么莫名其妙，甚 至自相矛盾，然而一旦我们有了伟大的仁爱之心，就会倾向于躲避人类， 讨厌人类；与其说是由于人们隐秘和自私的罪恶，毋宁说是因为相关的罪 愆：诸如妒忌、刻毒、出卖、残忍和其他各种恶行。这是真正怀有仁爱之
心的人所+分厌恶的。与其目睹这些并与之打交道，他宁愿躲开社会本 身。可是，我并非当面奉承，看来您并不像是我应当躲避或讨厌的那种 人。不但如此，从您透露出的一言半语看来，咱们彼此的遭遇还有相似的 地方。不过我希望您最后的结局比我圆满。”
说到这里，宾主之间相互恭维了一番，然后老人要开始讲起他的身世 了。正在这时，巴特里奇插了嘴。他对老人的疑虑已经大致消失了，然而 还残留着几分畏惧。他提醒老人刚才说到的上好白兰地酒。于是，酒立即 端上来了，巴特里奇满满饮了一杯。
这时，老人不说什么闲话，径直讲起您将在下一章里读到的事。
第十一章
山中人开始叙述他的身世
"我是一六五七年在萨默塞特郡一个叫马克的村子里出生的。我父亲是 个所谓的有身份的农民也。他自己有一份年入三百镑左右的小小田产，又赁 了一片土地，每年的进益也不相上下。他处世稳重，勤恳操劳，是个好庄 稼人，本可以过得自在而舒适。无奈他娶了个穷凶极恶的老婆，把他的家 搅得个鸡犬不宁。这虽然害得他十分痛苦，却并没使他遭到贫困，因为他 一直几乎没让她出过家内。他宁可关上门来忍受她那无尽无休的诟骂，也 不愿纵容她到外面去任意挥霍他的财产。
“这个赞蒂璧……"（巴特里奇插嘴说：苏格拉底的妻子也叫这个名 字。）"这个赞蒂璧给他生了两个儿子，我是小的一个。我父亲本来打算让 我们接受高等教育，可是我哥哥不幸因受到母亲溺爱，完全不肯读书，以 致上了五六年的学，竟然没有一点进步。老师告诉我父亲说，再学下去也 是白搭。最后，就按照我母亲的意思把他从那个专制魔王（我母亲这样称 呼那位老师）手里接回家来。以我哥哥的懒惰来说，老师对他的管教还远 远不够，然而就已经十分不合我哥哥的心意了。他不断地在我母亲面前告 状，埋怨老师虐待他，她也就经常听信我哥哥的话。”
"是的，是的，"巴特里奇大声说，"我见过这种做母亲的。我就给她们 咒骂过，而且十分冤枉。这种父母就该像他们的孩子那样好好受点管教。”
琼斯申斥那位塾师不要打岔，然后，陌生人又接着说下去。
"在十五岁上，我哥哥就和学问一一不，除了猎狗和猎枪之外，和一切 都永别了。在枪法上，他真是精通到了家。说起来您也许认为难以相信： 不但固定的目标他能百发百中，他确实打下过天空正在飞着的乌鸦。他也 最会抓伏窝的野兔。没多久，大家就公认他是这一带最出色的猎手了。母 子俩对这声誉都感到莫大光荣，真仿佛他被誉为最优秀的学者一般。
"看到我哥哥的情况，最初我认为自己的运道不及他，还得继续读书； 可是很快我就改变了这种看法。我在学问方面进步很快，读书不吃力了， 做功课成为莫大乐事，假日倒成了我最不愉快的日子啦。我母亲一向不爱 我，如今看出我越来越得我父亲的欢心，并且发觉（或者至少是以为）我 比哥哥更为一些有学问的人所赏识，尤其本区的牧师，她就把我当作眼中
钉，让我在家里过得不痛快。这么一来，通常学生们所说的黑色的星期一 四，对我来说反而是一年里最灿烂的日子了。
"在陶顿四念完中学，我就进了牛津大学的艾克塞特学院，在那里我读 了四年。在第四年的末尾，突然发生了一件事，使我的学习完全停顿下 来。后来我一生中所经历的一切可以说是从那一天开始的。
"有个叫乔治•葛雷沙姆爵士的，和我在同一个学院。这小伙子名下有一 笔可观的财产，可是按照他父亲的遗嘱，必须到二十五岁时他才能继承。 不过监护人对他十分优待，准许他在大学肄业期间每年支用五百镑，因 此，他父亲的过分谨慎也并没什么足以令他抱屈的。他在大学里养马，姘 妓女，生活浪荡，挥金如土，即使全部家产已归他掌握也不过如此。他每 年除了从监护人手里领到那五百镑，还想法另花上一千镑。当时他已经过 了二十一岁，所以可以毫不费力地随意举债。
"这个小伙子除了许多令人尚可容忍的恶劣品质而外，还有一个最毒辣 的手段：他专喜欢引诱家产不如他的子弟超出本人的财力去跟他一道挥 霍，以便使这些人破产，遭到毁灭。而且被糟蹋的青年本来的品行越好， 越庄重，越受人尊敬，他获得的愉快和胜利感就越大。他就这样扮演一个 魔鬼的角色，到处寻找可以吞噬的人。
"我不幸认识了这个人，和他交上朋友。我素有孜孜好学的名声，这就 刚好成为他那恶作剧的理想目标。而且我本人的爱好也使他用不着怎么费 力就达到了目的。尽管我很用功，也十分喜欢读书，可是有些乐趣对我的 吸引力更大，因为我精力旺盛，血气方刚，有些奢望，并且十分贪图女 色。
"和这位乔治爵士结交不久，我就参加了他所有的享乐活动，而一旦进 入这种场合，不论我个人的爱好或者我那份旺盛的精力都不允许我扮演配 角。在一切放荡行为上我都不甘居人后。不久，在捣乱、滋事方面我甚至 干得如此突出，以致我在浪荡者的榜上经常名列前茅。看到我当上了乔治 爵士的倒霉门生，大家不但不替我惋惜，反而说那位少爷本来很有出息， 都是我引诱了他，把他败坏了。尽管一切坏事都是他鼓动起来的，他是罪 魁祸首，然而大家从不这样看待他。终于，我受到副校长的严厉申斥，还 险些被开除。
"先生，您不难想象我此刻谈的这种生活和我在学问上的深造是不相容 的。我越是沉湎在花天酒地里，对钻研学问就越加疏懒。这是必然的结
果。然而事情还不止如此。这时，我的开销不但大大超过我原来的进项， 并且也大大超过了我借口准备考取文学士学位而向我那可怜的慷慨的父亲 勉强要来的钱。我向家里要钱越来越频繁，数额也越来越大，以致父亲逐 渐相信了他从各方面听到的关于我当时品行不端的传言。我母亲少不得也 从旁附和，夸大一番，她说：’哼，这就是你那一品人才、光宗耀祖的书 生，这个家就靠他来发迹呢。我还以为他这份学问会有多大出息，原来他 把咱们一家全毁了。为了叫他完成学业，连他哥哥很多必需的东西都不给 买，说他将来总会给家里带来好处的；敢情就是这样的好处啊……'她还说 了许多类似的话，不过我想这几句说给你们听听也就够了。
"于是，对我提出的要求，我父亲就不再用钱而改用申斥来回答了。这 样一来就提前使我面临危机。然而以我当时拼命和乔治•葛雷沙姆爵士比阔 的情形而论，即使我父亲把他的全部财产都交给我挥霍，也维持不了许 久。
"由于手头拮据，事实上已不可能继续浪荡下去，若是我在债台高筑、 无法自拔之前擦亮了眼睛，我本来是很可能头脑清醒过来，把精神重新放 到功课上去的。然而这正是乔治爵士手段高妙之处，他就是凭这种手段把 许多人引上毁灭之路，事后却嘲笑这些人是傻瓜、纨衿儿，居然敢和他比 阔。为了达到毁灭旁人的目的，他时而也替这个人垫付一些钱，以便维持 这个不幸者举债的信用。最后，正是由于那信用，此人竟被拖进无法挽救 的境地。
"随着经济上的破产，我的心灵也陷入绝望的深渊。为了得到解脱，什 么坏事我都想干。我认真考虑过自杀。如果不是脑子里出现了一个也许罪 孽较轻，可是更加可耻的念头，我一定就决计自杀了。"说到这里，他踌躇 了一下，然后大声说："隔了这么多年，也仍然没有冲刷掉这种行为给我带 来的耻辱，提起它来我还会脸红。"琼斯说，凡是叙述起来会使他感到痛苦 的事，都希望他略过去。但是巴特里奇热切地嚷道："先生，请说给我们听 听吧。我宁可旁的全不听，也要听听这段情节，我既然盼望我死后得救， 我担保一个字儿也不外泄。"琼斯正要去申斥他，这位陌生人却拦住琼斯， 接着说下去了 ："有个和我同房的学生，是个谨慎持重、省吃俭用的年轻 人。家里给他的钱虽然不算多，可是由于他手紧，居然积攒下四+多基 尼。这笔钱我晓得是放在他的写字台里。因此，我就乘他睡觉时从他裤袋 里摸出钥匙，把他的全部积蓄都据为己有，然后又把钥匙放回原处，佯作
睡觉，尽管我一下也没闭上眼睛，一直躺到他起床去做祈祷一一这类活动 我是早已不习惯了。
"胆怯的贼，由于过分小心，往往倒会给人识破，而大胆的贼反而能逍 遥法外。我的情形就是这样。倘若我索性大胆地撬坏他的写字台，也许他 甚至根本不会怀疑到我头上来；可是既然事情摆得明明白白，偷钱的人先 拿到了他的钥匙，所以一找不到钱，他就断定一定是同房的人偷的。但是 此人怕事，膂力又远不如我，我想勇气也远不如我，所以他没敢当面向我 问罪，唯恐皮肉吃到苦头。因此他马上奔到副校长跟前，先宣誓确实丢了 钱，然后说明情况。他控告的既然是全大学里人所共知的一个坏学生，不 费吹灰之力他就取得了一张拘捕状。
"幸亏第二天晚上我陪一位姑娘驾车到威特尼游玩去了，我们就在威特 尼过的夜，因此，我没回宿舍去睡。第二天早晨一回到牛津，就碰到一个 伙伴，他把关于我的不少消息透露给我，我听了不得不立刻调转马头。”
"请问，他提到拘捕状没有？"巴特里奇说。可是琼斯请那位先生不必 理睬这些唐突的问题，央求他径直讲下去。老人就这么说了下去：
"这时，我就放弃了回牛津的念头，下一步自然就是去一趟伦敦。我把 这个想法告诉了那位女伴，她起初竭力反对，可是我一亮出手里的钱，她 马上同意了。我们穿过田野，直奔赛伦塞斯特大道，拼命赶路，第二天晚 上就到了伦敦。
"倘若您想想我当时呆在什么地方，以及和什么人结伴，就一定会估量 到我得来的那笔不义之财没多久就花得一干二净了。
"这时我的景况比以前更加穷困得多，连衣食都没着落了。当时我已经 深深地爱上了那位情妇，看着她同我一道这样颠沛流离，尤其令我难过。 眼睁睁看着你心爱的人遭受困苦，你不能解救她；同时反躬自问，又知道 正是你自己害得她落到这步田地的，这恐怕是不曾身临其境的人所无法体 会得到的一种痛苦的煎熬。""我由衷地相信您的话，"琼斯大声说，"我从 心坎上同情您的处境。"说完之后，他胡乱在房间里走了几圈，最后向那位 朋友道了歉，就倒在椅子上嚷着："谢天谢地，我总算逃开了那种境地！ ”
"这种情势使得我的处境更加可怕，"老人继续说，"后来变得实在忍受 不下去了。我十分倾心地爱着这个女人，尽管我晓得朋友中间有一半跟她 姘居过，我还是坚决打算娶她为妻。我宁愿强忍住自己本能的欲望，没吃 没喝，可是对她那最荒唐的索求我都不忍拒绝。然而这个好人儿不肯同意
世人都会认为她极不相配的这桩婚姻。也许她看出我朝夕为她而苦恼、发 愁，对我同情，就决定结束我的痛苦。不久，她果然找出一条把我从彷徨 愁苦中解救出来的办法：正当我绞尽脑汁想方设法让她可以纵情欢乐的时 候，承她的盛意，把我出卖给她在牛津的一个旧情人；又多蒙这人的殷勤 照顾，我马上就被拘捕，关进了监牢。
"在监牢中，我才开始认真反省自己过去不正当的行为，想到自己所犯 的过失给自己招致的灾祸，以及我势必要给世上一位最仁慈的父亲带来的 忧伤。当我再想到我的情妇对我的背信弃义时，更是感到痛心疾首。我不 但不想多活些年，我对生命反而憎恨起来。死亡，只要能不同时给我带来 耻辱，已成了我最亲爱的朋友。
"巡回法庭四快要开庭了，他们根据法庭传票把我解到牛津去。我本以 为这一去准会定罪判刑，可是使我大为惊讶的是，竟没有原告出庭控诉 我。巡回法庭结束时，我未被起诉而获释。简单说，我那位同房已经离开 了牛津，究竟是由于懒得找麻烦，还是由于旁的原因，我就不得而知了， 反正他不肯把自己牵涉进去。”
"也许他不愿意自己的手沾上您的血，"巴特里奇大声说，"他这样是做 对了。要是谁由于我作证而上了绞刑架，那我就永远也不敢一个人睡觉， 总害怕会见到他的鬼魂。”
"巴特里奇，"琼斯说，"再过一会儿我简直要弄不清究竟你是较勇敢还 是较聪明啦。""先生，"巴特里奇回答说，"您尽管嘲笑我，可是如果您听 到我给您讲的一个小故事，是一件真事，您也许就会改变看法了。在我出 生的那个教区里……"这时，琼斯本想要他住嘴，可是那位陌生人替巴特里 奇求情，要让他讲出来，他并且答应利用这段时间好好追忆一下自己以前 的经历。
于是，巴特里奇就这样说了下去："在我出生的那个教区里，住着一个 庄稼汉，名叫布赖德。他有个儿子，叫弗兰西斯，是个很有出息的好青 年。我跟他一起上中学，我记得他已经能读奥维德的《书信集》了，他能 一连翻译三行，不需要查一回字典。而且他是个很规矩的孩子，从没旷过 一次星期天的礼拜，大家公认他是全教区的唱诗能手之一。偶尔他确实也 多喝上一盅两盅的，那就是他唯一的缺点了。皿得啦，快讲那个鬼魂 吧，”琼斯大声说。"先生，别着急，我马上就会讲到的，”巴特里奇 说。"您要知道，这个庄稼汉布赖德丢了一匹母马一一我记得是栗色的。过
不久他的儿子弗兰西斯去辛顿赶集，大概是在……日子我记不起了。他偏 偏碰上一个人骑着他父亲那匹马。弗兰克幽立即大声嚷道：’截住这个贼 呀！’您晓得，那正在集市正中心，贼是没法跑掉的。于是，大家就把这个 贼捉住，押到法官面前。我记得主审的是诺勒的威洛比法官，一位十分可 敬的绅士。他先把犯人下了狱，责令弗兰克具结。我记得他们是这么说 的。这个难懂的词儿是由'具'和'结'组成的；和其他许多复合词一样，连在 一起，就跟单字的意思不同了。最后，巡回法庭的佩奇大法官开庭审判 了。那个汉子就被提到庭上，弗兰克也被叫去作证。老实说，我永远也忘 不了那位法官问弗兰克控告犯人什么罪名时的脸色。他把可怜的弗兰克吓 得从脚跟起浑身发抖。’嗨，小伙子，’大法官说，’你有什么可说的？别光 站在那儿哼哼唧唧的，大声讲出来！’可是过了一会儿，他又变得对弗兰克 很客气，对那汉子却咆哮起来。当大法官问他有什么可以替自己辩护的时 候，那汉子说，马是他拾到的。’嚄，’法官说，’你的运气倒真不坏。我在 这个审判区巡回了四十年，我一辈子还没拾到过一匹马呢。可是我告诉 你，朋友，你的运气比你想的还要好：你不但拾到一匹马，我保证你还会 拾到一根绞索甦哩。’真的，我永远也不会忘记他这话。说完之后，大家全 笑了一一谁能忍住不笑呢？不，他还开了许多旁的玩笑，但是此刻我都记 不清了。他说什么自己对马还挺在行，也把大家逗乐了。那位大法官准是 -位既有胆量又有学问的人。旁听涉及犯人生死的案子真是再好玩不过 了。我认为有一件事做得太狠了些：大法官不准犯人的辩护士替他说话， 尽管犯人的辩护士要求只说一句，大法官也不肯听，可是他竟让原告的辩 护士讲上半个多钟头控诉的话。那么多人对付一个犯人，也未免太过分 了。大法官、审判长、陪审员、律师和证人们，一齐来对付一个可怜的 人，而且还是个用铁链锁住的人。反正那家伙最后也给绞死了，当然只能 这样。可是倒霉的弗兰克从那以后就再也没过上一天踏实日子。只要一个 人呆在黑处，就总觉得看到了那个汉子的鬼魂。""那么你要讲的就是这些 吗？”琼斯大声说。"不，不，"巴特里奇回答说，"天哪，我就要讲到正题 啦。一天晚上，弗兰克从酒馆里出来，正穿过一条又长又黑的窄巷子，他 迎头跟那家伙撞上啦：鬼魂一身素白，直向弗兰克扑来。弗兰克是个棒小 伙子，他也扑了过去，于是，两个就厮打起来。可怜的弗兰克给鬼打得可 惨啦，他好不容易才爬回家。他连挨打带受惊，整整卧病两个礼拜。这一 切都是千真万确的，整个教区人人都可以作证。”
陌生人听了这个故事微微笑了笑，琼斯则笑得前仰后合。巴特里奇看 到这种情景，就大声说："啊，先生，您尽管笑去。有些人听了也笑起来。 尤其有一位乡绅，大家认为他跟个无神派差不多：只因第二天早晨有人在 巷子里发现一头白面孔的死牛犊子，他就一定说，跟弗兰克交手的准就是 那牛犊子一一真好像牛犊子也会向人扑去似的。而且弗兰克告诉我说，他 肯定知道那是个鬼魂，不论走到哪个基督教国家的法庭，他都可以宣誓证 实。那天晚上他喝的酒也不过一两升罢了。愿上帝保佑，咱们的手可别沾 上一滴血！”
"好，先生，"琼斯对那位陌生人说，"巴特里奇先生已经讲完了他的故 事。希望他以后再不要插嘴。那么请您讲下去吧。"于是，老人又讲述起他 的经历来。不过既然他歇了一口气，我想理应也让读者休息一下。因此， 本章就此结束。
第十二章
山中人继续讲述他的身世
"我现在重新获得了自由，”那位陌生人说，"可是却丧失了自己的名 誉，因为一个人仅仅由法庭宣判无罪，和在自己良心上和世人的心目中宣 判无罪是大不相同的。我完全清楚自己的罪行，并且也没脸见人。所以我 决计第二天早晨，不等人们在阳光下看到自己，就悄悄地离开了牛津。
"离开牛津后第一个念头就是回家去见父亲，设法请求他的饶恕。然而 我没有理由可以设想他对我的行径毫无所闻，我也深知他对一切欺骗行为 向来都是深恶痛绝的，因此，我不能指望他会收容我，何况我深信各方面 的实权都操在母亲手里。不，即使我准知道我父亲会宽恕我，就像我准知 道他会憎恨我的所作所为一样，我仍然怀疑自己有没有脸去见他，能不能 不顾一切地低首下心去跟那些晓得我干过下流事的人们住在一起，打交 道。
"因此，我又赶回伦敦，这里是忧伤或耻辱（除了一些名声显赫的人 物）最妥善的隐身之所。在这里，你可以享受孤独的好处，而不会感到不 便，因为你既能独处，同时又是生活在人群中间。你或坐或行，都无人理 会。嘈杂、匆忙、不断涌现的事物都能为你消闲解闷，免得精神受折磨 ――说得更确切些，免得受忧伤或耻辱的折磨。忧伤和耻辱是最有害身心 的食品了。不少人只是在大家面前才略加品尝，可是有些人却在独处的时 候饱尝其滋味，以致痛不欲生。
"然而人类的事总是有一利必有一弊，有些人，我指的是那些身上一文 不名的穷光蛋，对于这种世态的炎凉又深感不便，因为陌生人不会使你难 堪，然而也不会给你饭吃，赠你衣穿。一个人就是在雷登大厦市场四里，也 和困在阿拉伯沙漠上一般，很容易就那样饿死。
"此刻，我正缺乏那个万恶之尤一一钱。我想准是有些作家自己因钱多 而受累，所以才这样称呼它。""先生，请原谅，"巴特里奇说，"我不记得 有哪位作家曾管钱叫malorum[86]，倒是有人管钱叫作irritamenta malorum[8Z]来着。Effodiuntur opes， irritamenta malorum.[88]""好 吧，先生，"陌生人接着说下去，"罪恶也好，罪恶的根源也好，反正我一 文不名，同时也没有朋友，我想连个相识的人也没有。一天傍晚，我正饿 着肚子，十分狼狈地从法学院走过，突然听到有人亲切地喊我的名字。回
过头来一望，我立刻认出招呼我的是曾经跟我在一个学院读书的同学。一 年多以前，在我还没遭到什么不幸的时候他就离开了大学。这位瓦特逊先 生热烈地和我握手，表示十分高兴见到我，并且提议马上同去饮一瓶酒。 起初我谢绝了，推说有事。然而他十分殷勤恳切，而我由于饥饿难捱，也 就顾不得面子了。我老老实实地告诉他兜里没钱，不过我还是撒了个谎， 说是由于早晨换了裤子。瓦特逊先生说：’杰克，咱们是多年老友了，这实 在不足挂齿。’于是，他就挽了我的胳膊向前拽去。但是他不需要怎么费 力，因为我自己的意愿拽得我比他更加有力。
"于是，我们就进了修士街，您也晓得，这是个寻欢作乐的好地方。走 进酒馆，瓦特逊先生完全不理睬卖饭的，只招呼酒保，因为他认定我早已 用过饭了。其实我没吃饭，所以我就又编了一个谎，告诉这位朋友我为了 办理要事曾到离城中心很远的一个地方去，匆匆忙忙地只吃了一块羊排， 希望他在请酒之外，再添上一盘牛排。""有些人不应太健忘了，"巴特里奇 大声说，"要不，难道您裤子里刚好装着只够付一块羊排的钱吗您提得 一点儿不差，"陌生人回答说，"而且我相信一切假话总归难免露出马脚。 咱们接着说下去吧。这时，我开心极了。酒和肉立刻使我精神焕发起来， 和这位老友谈得十分畅快，尤其因为我以为此人对他离开大学后发生的事 毫无所知。
"可是他并没让我在这惬意的幻觉中陶醉多久。他一手举着酒杯，一手 抓住我。’老伙计，恭喜你，’他大声说，’恭喜你了结那桩案子，体面地得 到释放。’听到这句话，就像一声霹雳，吓得我惊慌失措了。瓦特逊看出这 光景，就接着说道：’这没什么可害臊的，老兄。如今你放出来了，谁也不 敢说你有罪。可是请告诉我实话，咱们是知己：我倒希望你真的偷了他。 在我看来，剥光这个没出息的胆小鬼是一件值得称赞的事。我巴不得你偷 了他二千基尼，而不是两百基尼。说吧，说吧，好伙计，别不好意思告诉 我。你现在并不是在一个臭牧师跟前。我要是不为这件事而尊敬你，就叫 我下地狱。既然我死后希望得救，我也会毫不踌躇地干出这种事来。’
"他这番话稍稍减少了我的羞惭。这时，酒力似乎也敞开了我的心怀。 我就直言不讳地承认了那次的盗窃，不过告诉这位朋友，关于偷的钱数他 得到的消息不确，只有他提到的那个数目的五分之一多一些。
"'那可真太可惜了，’他说。’我希望你下回运道好一些。其实，你要是 肯听我的劝告的话，完全不需要去冒那个险。瞧，’说着，他从口袋里取出
了几个骰子。’就凭这玩意儿。这才是发财的工具。这才是一位专治钱包疲 软的小大夫。只要照我的话行事，我会指点你怎样去掏空那些窝囊废的钱 袋而没有腾云驾雾的危险。
"腾云驾雾！，，巴特里奇大声说，"先生，请问那是什么呀？"
"那是一句黑话，"陌生人说，"指的就是上绞刑架。在道德方面，赌棍 和强盗相差不了许多，所以他们用的黑话也大同小异。
"我们两人各自干了一瓶。这时，瓦特逊先生说赌桌正在上人，他必须 出场，同时，再三劝我跟他一道去撞撞运气。我回答说，目前我实在无能 为力，这他是晓得的，因为我曾告诉他，我的裤袋里空空如也。老实说， 从他一再表示的热烈友情，我毫不怀疑他会借给我一笔钱作赌本的。可是 他只回答说：’没关系，伙计，你尽管壮着胆子给他来个一溜烟儿。’（这时 巴特里奇刚要开口问那是什么意思，琼斯把他拦住了。）’可是挑人的时候 得当心。我会指点你找谁去赌。既然你对这里的情况不熟悉，又分不出哪 个是行家，哪个是脓包，也许指点指点还是必要的。’
"那时账单开来了，瓦特逊付了他自己的那份账就要离开。我羞怯地提 醒他说，我没带钱。他说：’这算不了什么。到门后头去记下一笔账，要不 就干脆大胆地走出去，不予理睬。要不一一等等，这么办吧，我先下楼 去，随后你把我这点钱也留下，到柜台上去统统记上账，我在拐角地方等 你。’我对这办法表示不很满意，并且隐隐指出，我以为两人的账全由他来 付的，但是他赌咒说，口袋里实在连一枚六便士也没有了。
"于是，他走下楼去，我也只好抄起钱来紧跟在后面。听到他对茶房 说，钱放在桌上了。茶房从我身旁走过，上了楼。我赶紧跑到街上，这样 就听不到他由于扑空而发出的呼声了。走过柜台的时候，我就照他吩咐 的，一声也没吭。
"我们直奔赌桌而去。出我意料，瓦特逊先生竟然像旁的赌客一样掏出 一大笔钱，摆在自己面前。每个赌客一定都把自己那一堆当作鱼饵，要把 周围别的赌客的那些堆钓过来。
"在这里叙述命运女神（或者不如说，骰子）在她的殿堂里所玩的种种 反复无常的把戏，未免太无聊了。总之，桌子这一端的金山须臾之间夷为 平地，而另一端的平地却忽然堆高起来。富的转眼变穷了，穷的转眼变富 了。哲学家再也找不到更好的所在来教导他的学生去蔑视财富，至少再也 没有比赌场更能说明财富之来去无常、极不可靠的地方了。
"至于我自己，在我那笔小小的赌本变为一笔可观的数目之后，终于又 输得一干二净。瓦特逊先生几经沧桑之后，带些激动地站了起来，说他已 经整整输了一百镑，不再赌下去了。然后他走到我跟前，要我陪他回到那 家酒馆去。我坚决拒绝了，告诉他无论如何我也不愿意再陷入那种尴尬的 境地；何况他如今已经输得精光，跟我一样是个穷光蛋了。’胡扯！’他 说，’我刚向朋友借了两个基尼，你拿一个花去吧。’他立刻把一个基尼塞到 我手里，我也就不再坚持下去了。
"回到我们先前狼狈逃出的那家酒馆，起初我还有点儿心神不安。可是 当茶房很客气地对我们说，刚才两位大概忘记会钞了，我才放下心来，立 刻递给他一个基尼，叫他拿去清了前账，至于他毫无道理地说我记性不 好，我也就默认了。
"瓦特逊先生要了一顿他所能想到的最丰盛的晚餐。以前，他喝点普通 的红葡萄酒就满足了。现在他却非喝最名贵的布尔戈尼红葡萄酒不可。
"不久，有几位绅士离开赌桌也参加进来。后来我才发现，原来他们到 酒馆不是来喝酒的，而是办事来了。那些真正的赌棍都装作不好过，滴酒 不进，然而却拼命劝两个年轻人喝一一事后那两人果然被骗得精光，干起 来真是毫不留情。骗到的钱我也幸运地分得一份，尽管我还未参与他们的 机密。
"这酒馆里的赌局出现了一件怪事：赌局刚开始的时候，半个桌面本来 堆满了金币。钱渐渐消失了。赌局到第二天（是个星期日）中午才收场。 结束以前，桌上竟连一个基尼也不见了。更离奇的是：除了我，在场的每 个人都嚷输。那么那些钱究竟到哪里去了呢？除非全给魔鬼拿走了，否则 真难断定。”
"准是叫魔鬼抄走了，"巴特里奇说，"因为即使满房子里都是人，魔鬼 也能施出隐身法把任何东西拿走。要是他把那些在该做礼拜的时候还赌钱 的一帮歹人全带走了，我也一点儿不奇怪。我还可以告诉你们一件真事： 一个男人去跟旁人的老婆偷情，魔鬼把这人从床上抓起来，把他从钥匙孔 里给带走啦。我亲眼见过发生这件事情的那座房子，三十年来没人敢再在 里面住了。”
尽管琼斯对巴特里奇的这种唐突有些气恼，可是听到他那些糊涂话却 又无法不发笑。那位陌生人也笑了笑，然后接着讲了下去。内容如何，请 看下一章。
第十三章
继续前述的故事
"这位大学时代的同窗如今把我引到一种新的生活里去。不久，我就结 识了一帮赌场上的骗子，并且参与了他们的机密：即是说，懂得了用于哄 弄赌场生手的一般骗术。至于更奥妙的门道则只有帮里极少数的人才掌 握，而他们都是这一行当里的头面人物，这种光荣对我来说是可望而不可 即的。我一向好纵酒，生来又容易激动，这就妨碍我在行骗上获得很大成 就一一这种艺术所需要的沉着镇定不下于最冷酷无情的哲学流派。
"当时与我亲密无间的瓦特逊先生不幸也嗜酒如命，因而他也并没像其 他某些赌棍那样靠干这行发上一笔财。他总是穷一阵阔一阵，在公共赌场 上从生手那里赢来的钱，往往又一边饮着酒，一边输给那些不动情感的朋 友一一他们是滴酒不进的。
"反正我们俩好歹就这样勉强混饭吃。这个行当我干了两年。在这期 间，我饱经沧桑，忽而财运亨通，忽而又穷得要命。今天享受豪华奢侈， 明天又过起赤贫的日子。往往头天晚上还穿着的丽服盛装，第二天早晨就 送进了当铺。
"一天晚上我从赌场回来，输得囊空如洗。在街上遇到一场骚动，许多 过路人围在那里。当时由于身上没有什么怕扒手扒去的东西，就挤进人丛 中去。一打听，原来一个人遭了劫，并且挨了歹徒的毒打。受伤的人浑身 是血，软得几乎站不住脚了。尽管我当时的生活和交往的伙伴已经使我的 诚实心和羞耻感残留无几，可是我的恻隐之心却还没丧失。我立刻上前， 表示愿意帮那位遇难者的忙。他深表感谢，就把自己托付给我，央求我把 他扶到一家酒馆去，好派人请一位外科大夫；他说由于流血过多，实在支 持不住了。看来遇上我这样一个衣冠楚楚的路人，他颇为感到快慰，因为 其他在场的人，从外表上都使他难以信赖。
"我挽住这个不幸的人的胳膊，把他搀到我们赌棍经常碰头的那个酒 馆，因为那恰好是最近的一家。幸亏当时酒馆里正有一位外科大夫，他立 刻过来照应，替他包扎好。听他说伤势不致有性命之忧，我自是十分高 兴。
"外科大夫迅速而谙练地料理完之后，就问伤者住在城里什么地方。那 人告诉他说，早晨才从外地来到伦敦，他的马还拴在皮卡迪利幽的一家客栈
里，此外他没有旁的住所，城里几乎没有什么熟人。
"这位外科大夫（名字我忘记了，只记得第一个字母是R）是位医界泰 斗，并且还是国王的首席御医近。医术高明之外，他还有许多美德，是一位 豪爽慷慨、心地慈善的人，随时都肯帮旁人的忙。他答应用自己的马车把 伤者送回客栈去，同时小声对伤者说，要是需要钱的话，他也可以接济一 些。
"那个可怜的伤者这时实在顾不得去感谢他的盛情了。因为他已经朝我 注视了好一阵子，接着就倒在椅子上嚷道：’啊，我的儿子！我的儿子！’随 即晕过去了。
"在场的许多人都以为事情是由于失血过多造成的。我最初就觉得这人 长得有些像我父亲，这时证实了我的猜测，确信出现在我面前的正是我的 父亲。我立刻扑到他跟前，把他抱住，热切地吻他那冰冷的嘴唇。说到这 里，我必须拉上幕布来遮住我所不能描绘的一个场景。尽管我没像我父亲 那样昏厥过去，然而我惊惧交集，有几分钟精神恍惚，简直不晓得发生了 什么事，直到我父亲苏醒过来，我才发现我是倚在他的怀里；我们热烈地 拥抱着，四行热泪从两人的颊上淌了下来。
"在场的人好像大多为这一幕深受感动，我们好比是演员，却恨不得立 刻逃开这些人的目光。因此，我父亲就接受了大夫的盛情，坐上了他的马 车。我也就陪他到了客栈。
"当我们单独在一起的时候，他才用温和的口吻责备我不该这么久没给 他写信，可是一个字也没提造成我和家庭隔绝的那桩犯罪行为。他告诉我 母亲已经去世了，他一定要我同他一道回家去。他说，许久以来他一直为 着我的缘故而忧虑重重。他担心我遭到的厄运比死更加可怕，因此，他也 说不好是怕我死掉还是巴不得我死掉。最后，他说邻居有一位绅士从那个 地方寻回了自己的儿子，这个人告诉了他我所呆的地方。他说，这次到伦 敦来的唯一目的就是把我从这种生活里救出来。他感谢上天，总算因这件 几乎送命的危险遭遇，把我找到了。想到他一半是由于我助人为乐的精神 而获救的，他感到十分高兴。他表示我这种精神比对他的孝心（即是说， 假使我事先晓得我救的是我自己的父亲）更使他欣慰。
"我还不曾堕落到对慈父的爱无动于衷的地步，尽管我很不配承受他的 爱。我立刻答应一定听从他的吩咐，等他一能上路，就跟他回家；有了那 位如此高明的大夫替他医治，不需几天他也就能远行了。
"我一直没再离开我的父亲。在我同他动身的头一天，我向几个最亲密 的朋友（尤其是瓦特逊先生）去告别。瓦特逊劝我不要仅仅为了顺从一个 老糊涂虫一阵心血来潮的想法，就把自己的一生埋葬了（这是他的说 法）。可是怎么劝诱也不中用，我还是重新回到了自己的家。我父亲这时 竭力怂恿我考虑结婚的事，但是我完全无心转这个念头。我已经尝过恋爱 的滋味了，您也许晓得最温柔而强烈的情感是多么难以控制。”说到这里， 老人停顿了一下，很认真地望着琼斯。一刹那间，琼斯的脸上忽而通红， 忽而苍白。老人望到了，没说什么，而继续讲了下去。
"既然衣食都有了着落，我就又用起功来，而且比以前更加努力。我只 把光阴花在阅读古今真正的哲学方面的著作上，而许多人却把哲学只不过 看作是诙谐和嘲弄的题目。这时我开始阅读亚里士多德和柏拉图的著作， 以及其他古希腊遗赠给后世的无价之宝。
"虽然这些作家没传授给我任何足以攫取财富或权力的方法，却教我如 何去藐视金钱和地位。他们激励人的性情，使人刚强坚定，不为变幻无常 的祸福休戚所左右。他们不但教人以智慧，而且授给我们明智的处世之 道，明白指出：假若我们希望在世上获得最大的幸福，或者想免于遭受从 四面包围并困扰我们的灾难的袭击，就只有依靠智慧作为我们的向导。
"这以外，我还从事另一种学问的研究。和这门学问比起来，最聪明的 异教徒所讲解的哲学充其量也不过是一番梦呓而已，并且一一如一些无聊 的讽刺家所形容的，其中确实充满了浮夸之词。我所研究的是只有在《圣 经》里才能找到的神的智慧，因为《圣经》教我们认识并且笃信的东西， 比整个世界所能提供给我们的更值得我们注意。这智慧是上天亲自为我们 揭示出来的，如果没有上帝的帮助，绝世的才华也对什么都不可能有所领 会。这时我才开始感觉自己过去在那些最杰出的异教作家身上所花的全部 时光等于白费了。不管异教作家讲的那些道理多么轻快有趣，仅仅就尘世 而言，多么适合待人接物的规矩礼数，然而如果拿来与《圣经》所显示的 光荣比较一下，即使经典著作也显得微不足道，其作用之无足轻重，就像 孩子们为儿童游戏所定的一些规矩。诚然，哲学使我们更加聪明，但是基 督教却使我们成为更好的人。哲学使我们的心灵高尚而坚强，基督教却使 我们温和、敦厚。前者使我们获得人类的赞美，后者使我们蒙受上天的垂 爱。前者保障了我们暂时的幸福，而后者却保障了我们永恒的幸福。由于 一时兴奋，说了以上的话，你们怕要厌烦了吧！”
"一点儿也不，"巴特里奇大声说，"上帝决不容许我们对宝贵的教训感 到厌烦的！"
"我极其愉快地度过了差不多四个年头，"那位陌生人继续说，"完全沉 浸在冥想中，丝毫没受到世事的骚扰。接着，我失去了世上最慈祥的父 亲。我全心全意爱着他，所以我的悲痛是无法形容的。这时我就丢下书 本，整整一个月都是在悲怆的悼念中度过的。时光，这位最擅于医治心灵 的大夫，终于安慰了我。”“是呀，是呀，Tempus edax rerum［丝。”巴特里 奇说。"这时候，"陌生人接下去说，"我又回到以前的研究上去，借着这种 研究彻底治好自己心灵上的病，因为哲学和宗教也可以说是帮助人进行心 灵的锻炼；对心灵失常的人来说，这种锻炼就像体格锻炼对于患病的身体 一样有益。它确乎和身体方面的锻炼起同样的作用，因为它能使心灵健康 而坚强，以致把人变得像贺拉斯崇高的诗句里所描写的：
Fortis, et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus ；
Externi ne quid valeat per Ireve morari ； In quem manca ruit sempre Fortuna.㈤
信赖自己，自己就站得稳；
他事事顺利，面面俱到，生活得一帆风顺；
并以更强的力量粉碎飞来的厄运。
――弗兰西斯先生［丝
这时，琼斯由于自己脑子里冒出的一个念头微微笑了笑，可是看来陌生人 并没理会到，他继续讲了下去：
"那个世上最好的人去世以后，我的境况大大不同了。我哥哥成为一家 之主。我们俩在兴趣和生活道路上是如此之不同，再也没有比我们更不投 机的了。尤其使我们一起过得不愉快的，是我的几个客人和我哥哥从野外 带回家来饮宴的一帮猎人完全合不来。这些猎人不但哇啦哇啦地说着无聊 的话，吵得文静的人不得安宁，而且还对他们加以辱骂。不论我还是我的 朋友们坐下来和他们同桌而食，都必然遭到他们的嘲笑，因为我们不懂猎 人的用语。真正有学问、见多识广的人，对于旁人的无知总是同情的，而
在雕虫小技上稍微见长的贩夫走卒，却总是非常看不起那些不懂他那一套 的人。
"总之，没有许久我们就分居了。我遵医嘱去饮巴思水。由于心绪郁 悒，再加上总在房间闷坐，我竟慢慢患上一种四肢麻痹症。巴思水被公认 为对这种病是极有灵效的。来到巴思的第二天，我沿着河畔散步。虽然还 是初春，太阳却晒得很热，我就躲到柳荫下，在河边坐了下来。不大工 夫，我听到柳树另一头有人在伤心叹息。忽然间，那人赌了个恶咒，嚷了 一声：’我再也忍受不下去了 ！’随着就纵身跳下水去。我马上跳起身跑了过 去，同时大喊救人。幸而下游离我不远的地方正有一个人在钓鱼。可是几 根很高的菖蒲遮住了我的视线，我没看到他。这人立刻跑了过来，于是我 们两人冒着些风险合力把投水的人拖到岸上。起初看不出半点生机，可是 当我们抓住他的脚后跟把他倒提起来（马上有几个人赶来帮忙），嘴里吐 出大量的水以后，他开始有了些呼吸，过一会儿四肢也能动弹了。
"恰巧有一位药剂师在场，他看到这人肚里的水已经快空干净了，身上 开始有些痉挛，就建议立刻把他抬到暖和的床铺上。他的意见随即付诸实 行，药剂师和我跟随着照应。
"由于不晓得那人的住处，我们就把他往一家客栈抬去。幸而这时遇到 一个女人，她尖叫了几声之后，告诉我们投水的这位先生原是住在她家 的。
"我看着那人得到了妥善的安置，就把他交给药剂师去照护。想来这位 药剂师治疗得法，第二天早晨听说那人就已经完全恢复了知觉。
"后来我去探望他，打算尽量探究一下他为什么寻短见；倘使可能的 话，替他想想办法，免得他将来再去干这种蠢事。我刚一被让进他的房 里，我们马上就彼此认出来了 ：这位不是旁人，正是我的好友瓦特逊先 生。这里，我就不必向您唠叨我们旧雨重逢的情景了，我要竭力避免啰 嗦。""请您一古脑儿都讲了吧，"巴特里奇说，"我很想知道他到巴思干什 么来啦。”
"重大的事我不会漏掉的，"那位陌生人回答说。然后，他就继续讲了 下去。等作者和读者都喘息一下以后，再把他的话记述下来。
第十四章
山中人讲完他的身世
"瓦特逊先生直言不讳地告诉我，"那位陌生人接着说了下去，"他是由 于时运不济，陷入不幸的境地，不得已才下决心要结束自己生命的。
"针对他视自杀为合法的这种异端的或者甚至是恶魔的见解，我和他极 其严肃地争辩开了，并把我对这个问题的想法全部讲了出来。然而使我+ 分不安的是，听了这些话他毫无所动。他对自己所做的这事，似乎一点也 不知懊悔，从而使我担心不久他还会再去干这种骇人听闻的勾当。
“当我把话说完，他并不试图答复我的责问，只盯住我的脸笑了笑 说：’好朋友，你跟我以前认识的那个时候，可真大不相同啦。在反对自杀 这件事上，恐怕哪位主教也没你讲得响亮。可是除非你能找出一位先生肯 借给我整整一百镑，不然的话，我不上吊，不投河，也得饿死一一在我看 来，这三种死法中，最可怕的还是最后一种。”
"我很郑重地告诉他，自从和他分手以后，我确实有了改变。我曾静下 心来反省了自己的浪荡行为并且深为懊悔。我劝他也这样做。最后，我要 他放心，如果一百镑对改进他的处境有所帮助的话，我可以借给他，但是 可不要把这笔钱花在骰子上，又去赌光了。
"当我说前一半话的时候，瓦特逊先生好像差不多已昏昏入睡，可是听 到后边那段话，他立刻醒了过来，热切地握住我的手，千恩万谢，说我真 够朋友，并且还说，希望我不要以为他执迷不悟，还会信赖使他上过这么 多次当的骰子。’不，不，’他大声说，’让我重起炉灶吧。万一以后命运再 一次使我成为一个破产商人的话，我会原谅它的。’
"对他说的'重起炉灶'、'破产商人'这些话的含义，我是十分清楚的，因 此，就十分庄重地对他说：’瓦特逊先生，您必须想法找点可以糊口的生意 或是职业。假如我看出您日后有归还的可能，为了使您能谋到一个既有出 息又体面的职业，我情愿借给您一笔比您刚才提的数目更大的款子。至于 赌博，不但这个行当本身卑鄙下流，而且据我所知，也确实不是您之所 长，迟早它准会把您毁掉的。’
"'这倒是件怪事，’他回答说，’不论您或是旁的朋友，都不肯承认我对 赌博一行有点门道，可是我敢说不论哪种赌博，我的手法都不比谁差。我
巴不得跟您赌上一场一一赌您的全部家产。这是我顶希望玩的把戏了，而 且怎么赌法，全凭您挑。说到这儿，老伙计，口袋里带着那一百镑吗？’
"我告诉他身上只有一张五十镑的票子，就交给了他，并且答应第二天 早晨给他带来其余的款子。然后，又劝了他几句，就告辞了。
"我的行动走在诺言的前头了，当天下午我就又回到他那里。一进屋， 看到他正坐在床头跟一个有名的赌棍玩着纸牌。您可以料到，这副情景使 我颇为吃惊。尤其令我伤心的是眼睁睁看到他把我那五十镑票子递到对方 手里，只找回三十基尼。
“那个赌棍马上就走了。瓦特逊说，他看到我很惭愧。’不过，’他 说，’我看出自己的赌运很不济，我决心永远也不赌了。我一直在考虑着您 提出的那个办法，我答应一定按照您的意思办，决不会有什么问题。’
"尽管我不大相信他那些保证，可是为了履行自己的诺言，我还是把其 余的五十镑交给了他。他开了一张收据给我；关于我那笔钱，我仅仅能指 望看到一张收据而已。
"这时，药剂师来了，我们也就不便再谈下去。药剂师满面喜色，甚至 没问问病人的情况，就嚷嚷说他收到一封来信，信里报告了一个不久就会 公开宣布的消息：’蒙莫斯公爵［丝］率领大批荷兰军队，已经在西岸登陆，另 外还有一支强大的舰队正逼近诺尔福克竺的海岸，准备登陆，以便从那边进 行牵制，好接应公爵的进攻。’
"这位药剂师是当时最了不起的政客之一。一份极无价值的邮件也比一 个极好的病人还要令他高兴。他最大的快乐莫过于比城里其他人早一两个 钟头获得某条消息。然而他的消息很少是可靠的，因为他几乎什么都信以 为真一一许多人就利用他这个脾气来开他的玩笑。
"当前他所传播的消息就是这样。过不多久大家就晓得公爵确乎上了 岸，但是他带来的只不过是几名扈从而已；至于在诺尔福克进行牵制战的 话，根本没这么回事。
"药剂师走进那房间只报告了这个消息，然后，对病人什么旁的话也没 说，就匆匆离开，到城里各处散布这个消息去了。
"在公共场合，一遇到这类国家大事，就很容易使私人的事情黯然失 色。于是，我们的话题就完全转到政治方面来了。以我本人而言，近来我 颇为担心一位信奉天主教的君主对新教显然是个威胁，觉得仅仅这种担忧 就足以说明叛乱是正当的，因为当天主教大权在握的时候，除了夺过它的
权柄来，就没法保证他们不摧残迫害，后来，沉痛的经验也证实了这一 点。你们晓得詹姆斯王在镇压那次的叛乱后是怎样行事的？他根本不遵守 他的王室诺言或登基时候的誓词，而无视人民的权利和自由。可是这一点 大家都没预料到，因此，支持蒙莫斯公爵的人并不多。然而当灾难临头的 时候，大家终于还是同心合力地把那个国王［丝］驱逐出去一一当他哥哥四在位 的时候，我们中间很多人曾热烈地反对取消他的继承权，如今又这样爱戴 他，热心为他效命疆场。”
"您所说的一点儿也不差，"琼斯插嘴道，"我也时常觉得，在我读过的 史籍里，这真是一个最奇怪的现象：为了维护我们的宗教和自由，全国曾 万众一心联合起来，驱逐了国王詹姆斯；而就在这创痛犹新的当儿，我们 中间竟然有一批人丧心病狂地想把这个王室再度捧上宝座。""您是在开玩 笑吧！"老人说，"决不会有这么一批人的。尽管我对人类不抱什么好感， 我也不相信他们会执迷不悟到这种地步。也许有一撮狂热的天主教徒，在 神父的率领下，会干出这种决无希望的勾当，并且还自以为是一场神圣战 争。但是我不能相信属于英国国教的新教徒，竟然会成了这样的叛教者， 这样的felos de se四。不会的，不会的。年轻人，尽管这三十年来我对人世 的一切是如此之隔膜，您也不能骗我去相信这样拙劣的神话。可是我看您 是有意拿我的孤陋寡闻来开开玩笑吧。""难道您和世间隔绝到了这种地 步，"琼斯说，"竟然不晓得这三十年间曾经发生过两次拥护詹姆斯子嗣的 叛乱，其中一次现在就正在本国中部如火如荼地进行着哪！"老人听了这话 大为吃惊，用极其郑重的语调央求琼斯对天发誓保证他所说的是实话。琼 斯郑重地肯定了他那番话之后，老人就一声不吭地在房里走了几圈，然后 叫着，笑着，最后跪倒在地，大声祈祷，感谢上帝拯救了他，使他和这个 荒唐透顶的人世绝缘。他说完这话，琼斯提醒他还没把自己的身世讲完， 于是，他又这样讲了下去：
"在我所谈的那个时期，人们还没疯狂到眼下这种程度（我显然是由于 离群独居才没受到沾染），因此，有不少人起义，声援蒙莫斯公爵。我的 信仰驱使我也赞助这一边，我决计参加起义军；瓦特逊先生出于另外的动 机也作出了同样的决定；在这种场合，赌徒的精神可以和爱国主义精神一 样令人奋不顾身。于是，我们打点好行装，就到布里奇沃特竺投奔公爵去 了。
"关于这件事不幸的下场，想必您晓得的同我一样清楚。塞吉摩尔理］战 役之后，我和瓦特逊先生一道逃走；在那场战役里，我受了些轻伤。我们 骑着马，沿着艾克塞特大路走了将近四十哩，然后丢下马，尽量爬过田野 和小径，来到公地上一座荒僻的小茅屋跟前。一位穷苦的老妇人竭力照应 我们，用药膏替我敷上伤口，我很快就痊愈了。”
"请问，您哪里受伤啦？"巴特里奇问道。那位陌生人告诉他是在胳膊 上，然后又接着讲了下去。"先生，第二天早晨，"他说，"瓦特逊先生就在 这儿跟我分了手，他假装说是到科伦普敦去办些食品来一一可是，我得讲 下去吗？您听了会相信吗？这个瓦特逊先生，这个朋友，这个卑鄙、残 忍、背信弃义的坏蛋，竟然到国王詹姆斯的一支骑兵队那里去告密，回来 的时候，把我交到他们手中。
"这时候，骑兵队一一一共六个兵士，就抓住了我，要把我押到汤顿监 狱去。可是，不论我当时处境如何狼狈，前途如何险恶，都远远比不上跟 这个狼心狗肺的朋友在一起更使我厌烦。他虽然自首了，但同样被当作俘 虏看待，不过受到较好的待遇罢了，他是凭着踩在我身上来得救的。起 初，他还竭力为自己不忠不义的行为辩护；可是当他从我口中只能听到藐 视和责难的话语时，他马上改变了口气，骂我是个穷凶极恶的叛徒，把他 自己的罪名一古脑儿推到我的头上。他说，都是由于我的怂恿甚至威胁， 他才拿起武器来反抗他的慈爱而又合法的国王的。
"这些捏造的供词（因为实际上他比我更加急进）刺痛了我，在我心中 激起的愤怒决不是局外人所能体会得到的。可是多承老天垂怜，我们刚走 出威灵顿不远，来到一条小径，押解我们的兵士就接到一份假警报，说左 近有将近五十名敌军出没。得讯之后，他们赶紧逃之夭夭，丢下我和那个 告密人去自寻活路。那个坏蛋马上从我身边溜掉，我也高兴他这样做，不 然的话，尽管我手无寸铁，也一定要对这个卑鄙下流的东西施以报复的。
"现在我重获自由了，就马上离开大道，朝田野走去。我简直闹不清自 己是在往哪里走，一心一意只是要躲开公路和城镇，甚至最简陋的房屋； 在我心目中，好像遇到的一切人都打算出卖我。
"在野地里乱跑了几天，吃的东西和睡的地方都和大自然赐给未开化人 类的一个样。最后就来到这里一一这地方的荒凉孤寂，诱使我定居下来。 最初我找来和我一道住的人，是这位老妇人的母亲，我们一直隐居到光荣 革命［皿的消息传来的时候。忧惧的心情这才消除，又给我一个重返故乡的
机会。我料理了一下家务，把自己那份财产全部让给我哥哥，他给了我一 千镑现款和一笔终身年金，事情很快就安排得我们双方都十分满意。
"在这件事情上，正像在一切旁的事情上，他的行为都是又自私又吝 啬。我不能把他当作朋友看待，而他也无意让我那样看待他。于是，我立 即向他和旁的熟人告别了。从那时起，直到今天，我的经历差不多就相当 于一张白纸。”
"先生，难道您真的从那时候起，一直住在这里吗？"琼斯问道。"啊， 不是的，先生，"老人回答说，"我很喜欢旅行。欧洲没有几个地方是我不 熟悉的。""我真不好意思再央求您啦，"琼斯大声说，"您已经费了这么多 口舌，再来烦扰您就未免太没人心了。不过，请容许我表示一下愿望：以 后有机会还想听您谈谈您的观感，以您这样既有见识又有学问的人，游历 了这么多地方，一定会有精湛的见解的。""好，年轻的绅士，"那位陌生人 回答说，"这方面我一定也尽量满足您的好奇心。"琼斯刚想再解释几句， 可是给拦住了。于是，他和巴特里奇都以饥渴的心情洗耳静听，老人就讲 起下一章里的这段话来。
第十五章
一篇欧洲简史;以及琼斯先生和山中人之间的意味隽永的谈话
"意大利的旅馆老板沉默寡言。法国的喜欢絮絮叨叨，可是懂得礼貌。 一般说来，德国和荷兰的老板很不知趣。至于他们诚实的程度，我相信是 相差无几。这些laquais^ louange［皿决不会放过一个可以欺骗你的机会。 至于马车夫，我看全世界的都是一个样。先生，这些就是我在旅途中对人 们所作的观察，因为我所接触的也仅仅是这种人。我到国外去游历，目的 在于看看上帝为丰富这个地球在各地安排的风光植物，鸟兽虫鱼，借以赏 心悦目。任何富于感受的人看了这五光+色的景物，都必然会感到极大的 愉快，在在都显示出造物主的万能、智慧和仁慈。老实说，在上帝所创造 的世界中，只有一种东西是对他的玷辱，长时期以来我一直避免同这种东 西接触。”
"请原谅我，"琼斯大声说，"我一向以为便是您所说的这种东西，也和 旁的一样是形形色色，各有不同的。除了本身有向善向恶的区别之外，据 说习俗和水土也使得人性发生极大的差异。”
"其实，相差不了许多，"对方回答说，"凡是想借游历四方来考察不同 的风土人情的人，只要参加一次威尼斯的狂欢节，就大可以省却到处去旅 行的麻烦了；因为在那里，他们足以饱览欧洲各国宫廷所能看到的一切。 同样的虚伪，同样的狡诈；一句话，同样的愚蠢和丑恶，只是穿戴上不同 的服饰而已。在西班牙，装出一副道貌岸然的样子；在意大利，则显得仪 表堂堂。在法国，骗子手总打扮得像个花花公子；在北欧，则装得不修边 幅。然而走遍天下，人性都是一个样，都是令人憎恶的。
"至于我自己，我从这些国家走过的时候，也许就像您穿过人群去看什 么表演时一样，一只手捂住鼻孔，一只手保护着自己的钱袋，不和任何人 说一句话，推推撞撞地挤过去，看看自己要看的东西；那东西本身不管多 么有趣，和周围的人引起的烦恼相比，也是得不偿失的。”
"在您走过的国家中间，难道就没有一些国家的人民不那么使您生厌 吗？”琼斯说。"有的，"老人回答说，"我觉得土耳其人要比基督教徒强一 些。他们沉默寡言，从不东问西问来打搅外来人。诚然，走在街上偶尔也 会有人骂你一声或朝你脸上啐一口，但这也就算完了。在这个国家可以住 上一辈子而听不到+来句话。但是在我所见到的外国人当中，上天保佑我
别再碰到法国人！他们那种该死的饶舌和烦琐的礼貌，以及在陌生人面前 颂扬他们的国家一一这是他们自己的说法，其实，只不过是发泄他们自己 的虚荣心。法国人是如此之令人厌烦，我宁愿在霍屯督族［皿中间过一辈 子，也不愿再涉足巴黎。霍屯督族是个肮脏的民族，但是他们多半脏在外 边，而法国以及其他一些姑不去指明的民族却完全脏在里面；霍屯督族只 熏我的鼻子，这些人却熏我的理性，因而更加臭不堪闻。
"先生，我的一生经历就这样结束了吧。至于我在这里隐居的年月里， 实在没有什么足以使您感兴趣的东西，大可以把它当作一天看待。我隐遁 得十分彻底，因此，尽管住在这个人烟稠密的国家里，却和住在底比斯［皿 沙漠上一样与世隔绝。我既然没有田产，所以也没有佃户或管家来找我的 麻烦。我的年金都按期支付给我一一也理应如此，因为那比我出让的产业 实际还差得多呢。任何人来拜访，我一概不接待。替我管家的那个老婆子 晓得，如要保住她这份差使，就只有家里需要什么都给我置办好，不用我 去操心；挡住一切请托，免得我和任何人打交道；闭上嘴，不让我听到她 的絮叨。我总是在夜晚出外散步，在这样人迹罕至的荒山野地里，总可以 不至于碰上什么人。偶尔碰上几个也给我吓得亡魂丧胆地跑回家去了，因 为看了我的装束和样子的奇特，他们都把我当作妖魔鬼怪。可是从今天晚 上发生的这件事看来，即使在这里隐居，我也仍然躲不开人类卑鄙的行 为。要不是承您搭救，他们不但会抢了我的东西，还很可能要了我的命 哩。”
琼斯向这位陌生人道了谢，蒙他费心讲述了他一生的经历。接着他表 示奇怪，他怎么能忍受如此孤单的生活；并说："您很可能抱怨这种日子过 于单调了，老实说，我真不晓得您是怎么度过，或者说消耗掉这样漫长的 岁月的。”
"在眷恋尘世的人看来，"对方回答说，"我的时光似乎是在这么个地方 白白消磨掉了，这我一点不感到惊奇。但是有一件事是人一辈子永远也做 不完的：我们哪里有足够的时间去膜拜、默祷那光荣的、永存不朽的上帝 啊？在他的伟大创造中，不仅我们这个地球，连满天无数的灿烂星体（尽 管其中许多是照耀宇宙间旁的世界的太阳）也只不过相当于几粒原子与整 个地球比起来那样渺小。如果一个人由于默祷而得以和那位无以名状、不 可思议的上帝交往，难道他将这种无上光荣多享受一日、一月或者一个时 期就嫌太长了吗？难道世上那些无聊的娱乐、乏味的欢笑和愚蠢的琐事倒
使我们感到光阴的飞逝，而当我们的心灵倾注在这样高尚、重大而且光辉 的研讨中，反而会度日如年吗？为了从事这一伟大工作，时光多长也是不 够的，没有什么地方是不相宜的。我们眼睛看到的哪样东西不使我们想到 上帝的力量、智慧和仁慈呢？旭日不必从东方的地平线上放出万道金光， 暴戾的狂风也不必从岩穴里冲出，摇撼高耸的森林，乌云也不必猛然裂 开，倾注滂沱大雨，淹没田野，来显示上帝的庄严。这些一概都不需要， 因为万物之中，一虫一草也罢，不论多么低微，没有不带着伟大的造物主 的标志的，不但标志着他的权力，也标志着他的智慧和仁慈。在阳光之下 的万物当中，只有人，这地球的主宰，这至高无上的上帝最后创造出来的 最伟大的作品；也只有人卑鄙地败坏了自己的天性。他以自己的欺诈、残 酷、忘恩负义和背叛行为，使造物主的仁慈成为疑问：使我们无法解释何 以仁慈的上帝竟会造出如此愚昧而卑劣的一种动物！然而我觉得，您竟认 为我与这样一个东西断绝来往是一种不幸！在您看来，如果不是在人世间 过活，日子就一定会变得枯燥无味了。”
“对于您前面所谈的那些话，我是完全由衷地同意的，”琼斯回答 说，"但是我认为（并且也希望是这样）您在最后对人类所表示的憎恨未免 过于笼统了。老实说，您在这里陷入一种错误，而以我的粗浅经验看来， 这种错误还极为普遍，就是把人中败类的所作所为，看作人类的特征；而 实际上正如一位优秀的作家所说，只有从一个物种最好、最完美的个体中 探求出来的东西，才能被视为这一物种的特征。我认为通常是那些择友不 慎，吃过坏人亏的人会陷入这种错误。根据两三个这类事例就马上加罪于 整个人性，那是十分不公平的。”
"我想我已经体验够了，"老人回答说，"我生平第一个情妇和第一个朋 友在一些事情上极其卑鄙无耻地出卖了我，事情本身都可能造成最可怕的 后果一一甚至使我死在耻辱当中。”
"可是对不起，请您想想看，"琼斯大声说，"您的那位情妇和那位朋友 究竟是怎样的人吧。我的好先生，对妓院里的爱情，和在赌桌上产生、培 养起来的友谊，您还能指望什么呢？以娼妓为例来确定女人的品格和以赌 徒为例来确定男人的品格是极不公平的，这就像由于厕所臭气熏人，从而 就认为空气本身令人作呕，对身体有害一样。我涉世还不算久，然而我却 遇到过配得上最崇高的友谊的男人，最值得爱慕的女人。”
"唉，年轻人，"这位陌生人说，"您自己也说，涉世还不算久，可是我 在比您目前的年纪还大些时也抱过这样的见解呢。”
“假使您在用情方面不是那么不幸(恕我说话造次)，不是那样轻 率，"琼斯回答说，"也许今天您依然还会抱着那种见解。再说即使世上的 坏事比现在还要多，这也不能证明您对人性这么笼统的指责是有道理的， 因为您的结论大部分是根据偶然事件得来的，而许多做过坏事的人在心灵 深处并不是邪恶透顶的。老实说，除了那些在自己的心灵里可以找到这种 劣根性的人(我相信您决不是这样)，任何人都没有权利来断言人性必然 是、而且普遍都是恶的。”
"恰好就是那种人最不肯这样断言，"这位陌生人说，"歹徒不会来劝我 们相信人类是卑劣的，正像强盗不会来告诉我们路上有人抢劫一样，因为 那么一来就会使我们有所警惕，从而也就使得他们自己无法得逞。由于这 个缘故，就我所知，歹徒责骂个别人倒是常有的事，但是他们从来不笼统 地说人性都坏。"老人讲得十分激动，琼斯看来是没有希望把他说服过来， 同时又不愿得罪他，因此就不再做声了。
天光已经发白，琼斯就向这位陌生人道歉，说耽搁太久，恐怕妨碍了 他的休息。老人回答说，他现在最不需要休息了，因为白昼和黑夜在他都 是一样。通常，他总是利用白昼来休息，黑夜去散步和读书。"不过，这是 一个明媚的早晨，如果您一时不睡觉，不吃东西，还能支持得住，我倒愿 意陪您观赏一下您从没见过的景色。”
琼斯欣然接受了这个邀请，他们马上就从茅屋出发。至于巴特里奇， 陌生人刚一讲完身世，他就酣睡起来了，因为他的好奇心已经得到了满 足，其余的话对他没有那么大吸引力，不足以驱除睡魔的侵袭。琼斯也就 由他去享受睡眠。这时候，说不定读者也很想安歇一下，我们就此把本书 的第八卷告一结束。

第九卷
十二个钟头里的事
第一章
谈谈哪些人够资格和哪些人不够资格写这样的历史
在每卷前面我都写一篇序章，我认为这样做有若干好处；其中之一就 是可以把它当作一种标记，好让泛泛地读此书的人来识别哪些是这类历史 作品的真货色，哪些是冒牌赝品。看来在不久的将来我们就非有这种标记 不可了，因为既然已有两三位作家凭这类性质的作品获得了大家的好评， 就很可能诱使人们群起效尤。这样一来，大量拙劣的小说或荒谬绝伦的传 奇势必会纷至沓来，不是害得书店老板赔本，就是浪费读者的光阴，败坏 他们的道德。不仅如此，这类作品往往还会散播一些流言蜚语，造谣中 伤，损害许多正派老实人的名声。
《旁观者》机智的撰稿者之所以每期都在卷首印上几句希腊文和拉丁 文的题词，想必是为了防止那些除了从书法教师那里学到的一点本领以 外，毫无才能可言的文字匠也来依样画葫芦。这些人既不知忌惮，又毫无 廉耻，竟敢用和伟大天才一样的标题，就像寓言里那头披着狮皮、嘶声号 叫的驴子°
有了题词这个巧妙的办法之后，凡是对这两种古代语言一窍不通的 人，就休想再来模仿《旁观者》了。同样，我也借这个序章的办法防止那 些根本不会思考，才学浅薄得连一篇短论也写不出来的人胡乱仿效。
我的意思绝不是说，这一种历史作品最主要的优点就在于冠上了这些 序章。不过实际上，那些纯粹叙述故事的部分要比阐发议论感想的部分更 容易诱使人去模仿。这里，我所谓的模仿是指罗威⑵之于莎士比亚，或者指 模仿伽图的罗马人一一照贺拉斯所说的，只模仿到了他的一双光脚板和一 张阴沉的面孔而已。回
编造有趣的故事并且讲得引人入胜也许需要有很不寻常的天资，可是 我看很少有人对于从事这二者有所踌躇。倘若检阅一下充斥坊间的小说和 传奇，我们就很可以断定这些作品的作者大部分是不敢用其他任何体裁一 试身手的（容我用这个措辞）；除了小说和传奇，换上任何一种文体，他 们连+句话也未必凑得起来。
Scribimus indocti doctique〔poemata〕passim」4
走投无路的笨蛋要是想在写作上试试运气， 诗歌是每个活人都会看中的门道。
__弗兰西斯［5］
这句话用在历史家或传记家身上，似乎比用在其他写作领域更为恰 当，因为不论什么艺术或科学（甚至评论本身），都多少需要具备一些学 识。固然，诗歌也许可以作为一个例外，然而就是写诗歌也需要懂得韵脚 或者类似韵脚的一些技巧。可是写小说或传奇呢，则除了纸、笔、墨水以 及能使用它们的手以外，旁的一概都用不着。根据那些作家们的产品，可 以看出这正是他们本人的想法，同时也一定是读者的想法一一倘若他们还 有读者的话。
世人总是根据大多数成员的情况来判断全体。他们看不起一切不根据 文献和档案来选取材料的历史家，因而我们也遭到了这种一视同仁的轻 蔑。然而正是由于怕蒙受这种轻蔑，我们才极其慎重地故意不称本书为传 奇一一如果不是有这种情况，我们也就十分满足于这么称呼它。但是正如 我在本书其他地方所提到过的［6］，书里一切人物都有根有据，其真实可靠不 下于大自然那本登记簿。所以我们的苦心之作完全够资格称作历史。它理 应得到另眼看待，不应该把它和某一位俏皮透顶的人认为是出于一阵 pruritus1^］，或者更不如说，出于一副昏聩的头脑的那一类作品等量齐观。
这类杜撰家不但玷辱了小说一一这个最有裨益而又最能引起读者兴趣 的文学体裁，倘若受到鼓励的话，他们还会带来另外一种玷辱一一我指的 是玷辱社会上许多善良、可贵的人们的名声，因为最愚蠢的作家正像最愚 蠢的友伴，总是要伤害人的。这两种人满口都是猥亵下流的语言。如果事 情确是这样的话，我们就难怪出自龌龊人笔下的作品必然也是龌龊的，而 且还会把旁的作品也带臭了。
今后为了避免过分浪费读者的光阴，避免糟蹋笔墨和滥用出版自由 ――尤以这种状况目前比任何时候都更严重地威胁着人类，我想在此提出 几个条件；对于写这类历史作品的人来说，每个条件都是必不可少的。
首先就是天资。像贺拉斯说的，没有充分的天资，不管你如何刻苦用 功，也无济于事。我所谓的天资是指心灵的那种（或者不如说，那数种） 足以深入到我们所见所闻的事物中去，并辨别其本质差别的能力。这不外
乎就是发明和判断，二者总称为天资，因为它们都是先天的禀赋。不少人 对这两者的理解似乎都错得厉害。我想，一般人必是把发明理解为一种创 造的能力，这么一来，绝大多数写传奇的作家就自认为最富于发明能力 了。实际上，发明（正像这个词儿所表达的）只不过是发现一一或者说， 挖掘而已；从广义方面来解释，就是迅速而且睿智地深入到我们所思考的 一切事物的实质中去的本领。不和判断力配合，这种本领是几乎不能存在 的，因为如果我们分辨不出两种事物的差别，那怎么能说已经发现了它们 真正的实质呢？在我看来，这是难以设想的。毫无疑问，分辨事物的差别 就属于判断力的范围。可是有些聪明人竟同意世上所有蠢人的看法，认为 很少人，甚至没有人，能一身兼备这两种本领。
然而对我们说来，纵然具备了这两种本领也仍是不够的，还必须富有 学识。在这一点上，我可以再度援引贺拉斯以及其他许多权威来证明：倘 使没有把工具磨得锋利的技巧，或者缺乏指导工作的规律，或者根本就没 有可工作的材料，那样，工具在工人手里也一无用处；而技巧、规律和材 料都要由学问来提供。造物只能赋予我们才具一一或者袭用我那个比喻， 就是给我们用以操作的工具；而学识则能把工具磨砺得可以使用，并指导 我们如何去使用它。最后，至少供给我们一部分材料。这里，对历史和文 学都必须有充分的知识。不具备这种起码的知识而硬去冒充历史家，那就 像没有砖瓦、木料、灰泥而想盖房子一样徒然。荷马和弥尔顿固然都用华 美的词藻点缀了他们的诗作，然而他们都是我们这一类的历史家，也是当 时一切学问的大师。
另外还有一种知识却远非学问所能提供的，只有从社会接触中才能获 得。对于了解人的性格，这是万不可少的。再没有比死啃书本、把岁月完 全消磨在学院里的那些饱学的书呆子更为无知的了。不论人性已经被作家 们描绘得多么细腻，真正实际的规律却只能在大千世界中去领会。其实， 其他方面的知识也都是如此。不论医学还是法律，都不是能从书本里真正 学得会的。不，无论农夫、种植园主还是花匠，都必须靠实际的经验来完 成他们从书本上获得的基础知识。不管贤明的米勒圆先生把一株植物讲得多 么翔实准确，他也必然还劝他的学生到园圃里亲眼观看一下。我们一定会 注意到：尽管像莎士比亚、琼生头 威彻禾少、奥特韦那样的剧作家文笔极其 细腻，然而有些微妙的地方却不是从剧本中所能完全体会得出的，那还要 靠迦里克、希柏或者克莱夫以那样的演员恰如其分的舞台动作来传达电。在
真正的生活舞台上，人物自然比用笔描绘的更加生动鲜明。那些大师根据 实际生活所做的精彩有力的描述尚且如此，那么那些不是根据自然、而是 根据书本知识写出来的东西就更是这样了。他们笔下的人物只不过是极其 模糊的临摹，既不形似，更谈不上传神。
我们历史家的这种接触必须广泛，不分贵贱高低，一律都要往来，因 为认识了所谓上层生活并不就等于懂得了下层生活；反之，熟悉了下等人 也并不能从而就了解到上等人的风尚。也许有人认为两种人中间只要熟悉 一种，至少就可以把自己所熟悉的那些描绘出来。然而即使这样，他也远 远不会写得成功的，因为实际上这两种人的愚蠢处只有在相互对照下才能 彰显出来。譬如说，正是在下等人朴素淳厚的衬托下，上流社会的矫揉造 作才更加突出，显得异常可笑。同样，下等人的粗野也只有和上等人的文 雅相互对照之下，才越发触目。老实说，和这两种人往来都有助于改善历 史家做人的态度：从下等人方面他可以看到朴实、坦率和诚恳的榜样；上 等人则可以教他斯文、典雅和豪爽一一后一种品质我很少在出身寒门又没 受过什么教育的人身上见到。
除非历史家具有一颗通常所谓的善良的心，对事物能有感应，否则所 有这些美德都是枉然。贺拉斯说，如果一个作家想使我哭，他必须自己先 哭才成。实际上，倘若一个人对一片悲惨景象无动于衷，他就不可能把它 描绘得逼真。我也毫不怀疑那最悲惨动人的场面都是挥泪写出的。滑稽场 面也是这样。我深信，除非我自己先捧腹大笑，否则我永远也不能使读者 发笑。但是随时都会出现这样一种情况：读者不是跟着我笑，却想反过来 嘲笑我。也许这一章里有些地方就是这样，我不免感到担心，就此停笔 吧。
第二章
琼斯先生和山中人散步的时候，遇到一桩着实出人意料的事
黎明刚刚打开它的窗子，也就是说，天已破晓了。这时，琼斯在那位 陌生人的陪同下登上了马扎德山。一到达山顶，面前马上就出现一片全世 界最壮丽的景色之一。我们本想把这幅奇景描绘出来供读者观赏，可是由 于两个原因我们不这样做了。第一，因为不可能使那些亲眼看过这景色的 人佩服我们的描绘；第二，因为怀疑那些不曾见过这景色的人会不会理解 我们的描写。
琼斯在那里一动不动地伫立了一阵，凝视着南方。看到这情景，老人 就问他在聚精会神地瞧着什么。"咳，先生，"琼斯叹了口气说，"我是想看 看我自己是从哪条路来到这里的。好家伙，格洛斯特离咱们有多远呀！从 此地到我自己的家乡，中间隔着多么广阔的一片土地呀！""嗯，嗯，年轻 的绅士，"另一位大声说，"要是我没猜错的话，您慨叹的大概不是这里距 离您自己的家有多么远，而是距离您爱之甚于家的那个人儿有多么远。我 觉出您心里正在思念的目标并不在您的视野之内，可是只要朝那个方向望 望，您就是快乐的。"琼斯微微笑了笑，回答说："老先生，看来您还不曾 忘记青春时代的情怀。我承认我心里想的跟您猜测的一样。”
这时，他们朝山岭的西北坡走去，山脚下绵延着一大片森林。刚走到 这里，就远远地听见下面森林里有个女人拼命尖叫的声音。琼斯倾听了一 会儿，然后，连个招呼也没打，丢下他的同伴（当时的情况看来确实很紧 急）就从山上跑下去，或者不如说，滚了下去，丝毫也没考虑自己的安 全。他照直奔向发出声音的那片密林。
走进森林没几步，就看到一幅极其令人震惊的景象：一个恶棍按住一 个被剥得半身赤裸的女人，已经用吊袜带勒住女人的脖子，正要把她吊到 一棵树上去。这当儿，琼斯一句话也没问，飞快扑向那个坏蛋，狠狠挥起 他那根坚实可靠的橡木棒，给那家伙来个冷不防；几乎在他还没察觉琼斯 的来势之前，就已经滚倒在地了。琼斯的棒还打个不停，倒是那妇人把他 拦住，说她相信打得够重了。
随后，这个不幸的女人跪在琼斯面前，满口谢他活命之恩。琼斯马上 把她扶起来，说在这种地方是很难遇到人的，他很高兴一个极不平常的机 遇使他得以搭救了她。然后又说，想来上天是有意借他的手荣幸地来保护
她的。那妇人说："不，我甚至把您看作一位好心的天使。老实说，在我眼 中与其说您长得像人，还不如说您更像天使。"琼斯确实很可爱。如果一副 匀称的身材和俊秀的相貌，再加上青春、健康、膂力、活泼、朝气和亲切 愉快的神情就能使人酷似天使的话，那么琼斯一定可以当之无愧了。
然而被救的那个受害者长得却远不及他像个天使。看来她至少也已是 个中年妇人了，容貌也说不上漂亮。可是她整个上身的衣服全都给扯下来 了，一对十分白皙、丰满的乳房吸住了她那位救命恩人的眼睛。他们默不 作声地伫立了一会儿，彼此定睛望着。直到倒在地上的那个恶棍开始动 弹，琼斯才拾起那根原来另有用途的吊袜带，把那恶棍的双手反绑在背 后。这时，他仔细一看那家伙的脸，不禁大为惊讶，而且也许还颇有些心 满意足；他认出那家伙不是旁人，原来正是旗手诺塞顿。旗手也并没忘记 他这个旧日的仇人，他一苏醒过来，立刻就认出是琼斯。两人的惊讶都不 相上下，只是这一次旗手谅必没有琼斯那样喜出望外。
琼斯把诺塞顿扶了起来，然后死死盯住他的面孔说："先生，你没想到 这辈子还会碰到我吧。其实，我也没料到会在这儿遇到你。可是命运又叫 咱们碰头了。尽管我当时不晓得打的是你，也总算让我报了仇。”
"这可真像个体面人干的事，"诺塞顿回答说，"从背后来对人报仇！我 身边没有剑，没法在这儿跟你决斗。要是你真敢像个绅士那样办事的话， 咱们就走到一个我可以弄到一把剑的地方。我是个讲究荣誉的人，当然要 来应战。”
"你这样的浑蛋也配讲什么荣誉！"琼斯嚷道，"你玷污了这个字眼儿。 可是我不想跟你费口舌。恶人就得现世现报，饶不了你。"然后，他转过身 来问那妇人家离这儿近不近，要是不近的话，这一带可有什么熟人，找点 整齐的衣服穿上，好到保安官那里去告状。
她回答说，在这一带什么相识的人也没有。琼斯想了想，说左近他倒 有个朋友，可以去求他想想办法。他心里还奇怪，那人怎么没跟进来呢。 其实，当我们的主人公离开后，善良的山中人却独自坐在峻峭的崖石上。 尽管手里有枪，他却非常耐心而冷静地等待事情的结局。
琼斯走出森林，望到老人像前边描写的那样在上边坐着，就使出生平 的气力，飞快蹿上山顶。
老人建议他把妇人领到厄普顿去，说那是离这儿最近的一个城镇，到 那里一定就可以替她置办一切了。琼斯向山中人打听清楚去厄普顿的路，
并且托付老人把这条路也指给巴特里奇以后，就辞别他，急忙赶回森林。
当我们的主人公离开森林去找朋友的时候，他想既然恶棍的双手是反 绑着的，就不可能再在那可怜的女人身上打什么坏主意了。而且他知道自 己走不多远，总可以听见她的喊声；万一恶棍想捣什么乱，他也来得及赶 回来制止。同时他还正告那个坏蛋，倘若对那妇人稍微有些无礼的话，他 就立时亲手在他身上报仇。不幸琼斯忘记了，尽管诺塞顿的手是绑着的， 他的双腿却仍然行动自由；而且他一句也没警告这个囚犯，不许擅自使用 他的腿。既然诺塞顿也没立过这样的誓言，他认为自己没有任何义务等待 琼斯来正式开释，乘此溜掉也没什么不体面。于是，他就拔起那双自由的 腿，穿过便于撤退的森林走掉了。也许那妇人只顾朝她那位救命恩人去的 方向张望，丝毫也没料到他会逃跑，或者根本没理会他是否会逃跑，也不 肯费神去制止他。
因此，琼斯赶回来时，只剩那妇女一个人了。琼斯本想花点工夫去搜 索一下诺塞顿的，可是妇人把他拦住了，她一再央求琼斯陪她到老人所指 点的那座城镇去。"至于那家伙逃走了，我并不怎么感觉难过，"她说，"不 论哲理还是基督教义，都教导大家要宽恕加害于我们的人。可是为了给您 惹来的麻烦，我感到十分不安。而且在您面前这么赤条条的，我也实在不 好意思正眼看您。要不是需要您的保护，我真巴不得自个儿走去呢。”
琼斯要把自己的大衣借给她穿，可是不晓得为了什么，怎么殷切地 劝，她也不肯穿。随后，琼斯又要求妇人忘却使她惶恐不安的两件事。"关 于前者，"他说，"保护您只是我应尽的责任。至于后者，一路上我可以一 直走在您前头，这样您就完全不会感到难为情了。因为我既不愿意用自己 的眼睛去亵渎您，又没法保证准能不被您的美貌所吸引。”
于是，我们的主人公和他搭救的那位妇人就像从前俄耳甫斯和欧律狄 刻也那样，一前一后地走着。虽然我不相信这位美人儿有意勾引琼斯回头， 可是一路上由于她不断地需要琼斯的搀扶，诸如迈过栅栏，要不就是给什 么绊住了脚以及旁的事故，他只好时常回过身来。不过琼斯比可怜的俄耳 甫斯要幸运多了，他总算把他的同伴一一或者说跟班一一平安无事地领到 了赫赫有名的厄普顿镇。
第三章
琼斯先生陪那位女伴来到客栈;厄普顿战役的详细经过
尽管我们相信读者急于知道这位夫人是何许人，以及她是怎样落到诺 塞顿先生手里的，我们还是要求大家暂时按捺一下好奇心。由于读者以后 总会猜得出的一些极好的理由，我们不得不迟一些再使大家得到满足。
琼斯先生和他的女伴刚一进镇子，就照直来到他们认为街上最漂亮的 一家客栈。琼斯吩咐伙计领他看看楼上的一个房间。他正上楼梯的当儿， 客栈老板一把抓住跟在琼斯后边的那个蓬头垢面的女人，大声嚷道："嗨， 这个讨饭婆子往哪儿走！在楼底下呆着。”可是琼斯登时从楼梯上大吼 道："让那位太太上来！"声调是那么威严，老板只好立刻缩回手去。那位 太太赶紧乘势朝房间走去。
琼斯祝贺她平安到达了，然后就走出房内，想招呼老板娘替她送几件 衣服上来。那可怜的妇人由衷地感谢了他的种种盛情，并且希望等一会儿 还可以见到他，再好好向他道谢。在进行这段简短的交谈时，她尽量用胳 膊掩住她那雪白的胸部。琼斯难免偷偷瞅上一两眼，尽管他竭力避免有什 么失礼的地方。
这两位客人恰好住到一家声誉极好的客栈里了，端庄的爱尔兰太太小 姐以及北英格兰的许多这一类的闺秀在前往巴思的途次，总喜欢在这里下 榻。因此，老板娘决不允许在她这家客栈里干什么不体面的勾当。这种行 径确实十分龌龊、下流，即使最干净的地方，一旦发生这类事情也会被玷 污了，那些容忍这种行为的旅店便会被说成是个坏地方，或是声名狼藉的 地方。
我倒并不认为接待过往行人的旅店里可以保持像威斯塔神庙也那样一尘 不染的圣洁。老板娘并不奢求那样的福分，前边谈到的那些太太、闺秀以 及任何对品德一丝不苟的妇女也都不会希望或坚持那样做。但是人人都有 权利摒下流的姘妇于墙外，把一切褴褛的娼妓赶出门去。这位老板娘对这 一点毫不放松，而她那些衣冠楚楚、品行端庄的旅客们也有充分理由期待 她这样做。
要是人们怀疑琼斯先生和他那衣衫褴褛的同伴存心想干某种勾当，这 也是不足为怪的，尽管这种勾当在有些基督教国家里是容许的，在另外一 些国家里也得到了默许，而所有的国家里都在实行着，可是这些国家所一
致信奉的那个宗教对这种行为却像对凶杀或其他可怕的恶行一样明白禁 止。因此，老板娘一听说客栈里来了这么两位客人，就立刻考虑如何尽快 把他们赶出去。为了做到这一点，她准备了一根又长又厉害的武器；和平 时期，这本来是女仆用来破坏辛勤的蜘蛛劳动成果的工具。说得通俗一 些，她抄起一把笤帚，而她刚要从厨房里冲出的当儿，琼斯跑来跟她说 话，请她找件长袍和几件内衣给楼上那位半裸的女人穿。
当我们已经对某人深恶痛绝时，如果有人还来替他额外索求什么，再 没有比这种事更惹人气恼，更令人难以保持忍耐这一重要美德的了。正是 由于这样，莎士比亚才巧妙地令苔丝狄蒙娜在她丈夫面前替凯西奥托情M 借此不但煽起奥瑟罗的醋意，并且使他震怒到了疯狂的地步。我们看到不 幸的摩尔人这时比他在想象的情敌手中发现他送给妻子的那件珍贵礼物的 时候更加怒不可遏四。事实上，我们认为这种请托是把人看得太愚蠢了，是 男人的自尊心所难以忍受的。
尽管这位老板娘是个好性子的女人，想必她的天性里也有些这种自尊 感，因为没等琼斯说完他的要求，她就用某种武器朝他扑将过来。虽然这 武器不长、不尖、不硬，看起来既打不死也打不伤人，可是却曾令多少足 智多谋的人，甚至许多骁勇的人也望而生畏。有些人敢于朝着装了炮弹的 炮口望，却不敢朝这件武器以正在里面活动的那张嘴看一眼。他们宁可在所 有熟人面前当个最卑怯的可怜虫，也不愿去冒被这武器扫荡的风险。
老实说，恐怕琼斯先生就属于这一类。尽管他遭到上述武器的进攻和 痛击，却无论如何也不肯进行抵抗，只是极其怯懦地央求对方停止攻击， 说得明白一些，他只是恳求老板娘让他把话讲完。可是没等琼斯这个请求 获得允许，客栈老板本人也投入战斗，站在看来几乎不需要援军的那一 边。
有一种英雄在参加还是回避一场战斗上，似乎取决于对手的品格和举 止。这种人据说对男对手很了解，我相信琼斯对女对手是了解的。因此， 尽管他对老板娘是如此尽力退让，可是一旦她的丈夫朝他袭来，琼斯立刻 就怒不可遏了，他要他安静点，不然就给他点厉害尝尝。这么一来，我看 恰好是火上加油。
客栈老板气冲冲地，又带些怜悯的口气回答说："你先得祷告祷告，求 上帝给你那份能耐。我自信要比你强得多，不论从哪一方面说，也强得
多。"接着，他就一连骂了楼上那位女客六声婊子。那最后一声刚要出口， 琼斯挥起手里那根棍子，对准他肩头就是一棍。
现在还击得更快的究竟是老板还是老板娘，就很难说了。老板手里没 家伙，就使起拳头。老板娘举起她的笤帚，朝琼斯的脑袋打去。本来这下 子也许就立即结束了这场斗殴，同时也结束了琼斯的性命，可是笤帚中途 被截住一一并不是由于什么异教神祇显灵，出面干预，而是由于虽说很幸 运但是也很自然的一件事：巴特里奇来到了。他恰好在这一刹那走进客栈 （因为害怕，他从那山上一路都是跑来的），他一看到自己的主人，或者 旅伴（随你怎么称呼都可以）面临危险，马上就抓住老板娘正在空中挥舞 的胳膊，从而阻止了一场惨剧的发生。
老板娘立刻感觉出有人阻截她的袭击，同时，又无法把自己的胳膊从 巴特里奇的手里挣脱出来，就松开了笤帚。这时，老板娘让丈夫去惩治琼 斯，她自己凶猛地朝那个可怜的人扑来；巴特里奇早已表明了自己的身 份，他一进门就大声嚷道："他妈的，你想杀害我的朋友吗？"
巴特里奇虽不大好战，可也不能眼看着自己的朋友受到攻击不管。何 况他对自己担任的这部分战斗还颇感兴味。所以一受到老板娘的袭击，他 立即还手。战事顽强地全面进行着，很难说命运女神将偏袒哪一方。这当 儿，那位赤身露体的女客在楼梯口听到了动手之前双方交谈的内容，就蓦 地奔下楼来，也顾不得去考虑两个打一个之不公道，就扑向正跟巴特里奇 比武的那个可怜的女人，而那位伟大战士看到来了援军，不但没有罢手， 反而打得更加猛烈起来。
亏得女仆苏珊这时跑来助老板娘一臂之力，不然的话，胜利早已归于 旅客方面了一一因为不管多么勇敢的战士，也是寡不敌众的。这个苏珊的 力气不逊于这一带任何一位双拳并用的能手。我相信她足可以把著名的塔 丽丝特里斯也本人或者她麾下的任何亚马孙女杰打败。她个子粗大壮实，不 带女人气，在这种格斗中正可大显身手。她的胳膊和双手生得特别有力 气，打在敌人身上格外痛，而她的脸则生得任凭你怎么打也受不到重大损 伤。她的鼻子早已扁得和她的脸一般平了，她的嘴唇又厚又肥，打肿了也 看不出，而且又如此之结实，拳头打上去也留不下什么痕迹。最后，她的 颧骨高耸，造物似乎让它们充当一对碉堡，以便在她非常胜任又极其喜欢 的格斗中保卫她的眼睛。
这位可爱的人儿一投入战场，马上就参加到正在只身和一男一女苦斗 着的女主人那一边。女仆这时要单和巴特里奇交手，巴特里奇接受了这一 挑战。于是，两人就展开了一场殊死战。
现在战狗张牙舞爪，开始舔着血淋淋的嘴唇；胜利舒展开它那金色的 翅膀，凌空翱翔；命运女神从架子上取下她的天平，一端是琼斯、他的女 伴和巴特里奇的吉凶，另一端是客栈老板、老板娘和那个女仆的祸福一一 双方在她面前正好一般高低的时候，不料一桩可喜的意外事突然结束了这 场血战，本来参战者中有一半也已经打得尽兴了。原来一辆驷马高车来到 客栈门前，老板和老板娘立即住了手；而且，对方应他们的请求也住了 手。但是苏珊对巴特里奇却不那么客气。这位女将把敌人打倒后，骑在他 身上，这时正挥动双拳，尽情捶打着，对巴特里奇的休战请求和他的大声 呼救一概置之不理。
可是琼斯一放开老板，立刻就奔过来接应吃败仗的战友，费了好大力 气才把那气冲冲的女仆从巴特里奇身上拉开。但是巴特里奇一时还没发觉 自己已经得了救。他依然倒在地上，两只手捂着脸，仍不住喊叫，直到琼 斯硬逼着他睁开眼睛，看看战事已告结束，他这才住口。
老板看不出受到什么损伤，老板娘用手帕掩着抓得到处是伤的脸，两 人赶到客栈大门去迎接那辆驷马高车。这时，一位小姐和她的女仆从车上 走了下来。老板娘立刻把她们让进琼斯先生最初安置他那位美人儿的房 间，那是客栈里最好的一间。要走到那间屋子，她们势必得经过适才的战 场。两位客人急急忙忙地走了过去，以免受人注意，还用手帕遮着脸。其 实，她们大可不必这么防备，因为那位可怜而倒霉的海伦四一一这场血战命 中注定的导因，正竭力掩藏她自己的面孔，而琼斯也正忙于把巴特里奇从 震怒的苏珊手里搭救出来。幸好救成后，那可怜的家伙立刻跑到水泵那里 去冲洗他的面孔，并且堵住苏珊在他鼻孔里打开的那条流个不停的血河。
第四章
来了一位军人，完全结束了这场战斗，并促使全体交战者建立起巩 固而持久的和平
这时，一个军士带领一小队火枪兵押着一个逃兵来到了客栈。军士先 打听谁是此地的首席保安官，老板说他本人就担任这个职务。于是，军士 就要求他给安排住处，并且拿一杯啤酒来。他一面口里抱怨着寒冷，一面 就摊开手足在灶火前烤起来。
琼斯先生此刻正在安慰着那个受难的忧伤的妇人。她在厨房里一张桌 子旁边坐下来，用胳膊肘支着头部，吐诉着自己的不幸遭遇。免得女性读 者为某一情况痛苦不安，我们理应在这里交代一下：那妇人在离开她的房 间下楼之前，先找到一只枕套把自己严严实实地遮了起来。所以尽管房里 有那么多男人，她还不算有失体统。
这时，一个兵士走到军士跟前，跟他耳语了几句。于是，军士定睛看 着那妇人，看了将近一分钟，然后走到她跟前说："对不起，太太，我想我 不至于认错了吧，您一定是沃特尔大尉的夫人。”
可怜这个妇人在目前这狼狈的情况下一直也没有心思去看看旁的人。 她一看到军士，马上就认出他来。她叫着他的名字，说她正是他所猜想的 那个倒霉的人，然后又说："想不到我这种样子还有人认得出！"军士说， 看到夫人这样装束，他感到十分吃惊，恐怕她遇到什么意外了吧。"我当真 遇到了意外，"她说，"多亏这位先生（指着琼斯），我才没送掉性命，如 今才能活着和您谈这件事。皿不管这位先生帮了多大忙，”军士大声 说，"大尉都一定会重重酬谢他的。要是我有什么可效劳的地方，务必请夫 人吩咐，要是能替您做点什么，我会感到十分荣幸的。我相信这些弟兄们 个个也都愿意为您效力的，因为大尉一定会厚赏他们。”
客栈的老板娘在楼梯上听到了军士和沃特尔太太之间的谈话，就赶快 下楼，跑到这位太太面前来赔礼，求沃特尔太太原谅她适才的卤莽无礼， 说那完全是由于不知道她是位上等人。"老天爷，"老板娘说，"拿您这个打 扮，我怎么能料到是位有身份的夫人呢！太太，要是我料得到您就是您的 话，即使烧了我的舌头我也不会说出刚才那种话来。在您自己的衣服还没 送到之前，希望您先穿上我的一件长衫吧。”
"别再放肆啦，"沃特尔太太说，"难道我会在意你这种下等人说出的什 么话吗？可是我也奇怪，刚才闹完这么一场之后，你竟然以为我会穿你的 什么破烂衣服！告诉你说吧，女人，我还不至于下作到那种地步！”
这时，琼斯插嘴了。他央求沃特尔太太不要跟老板娘计较，还是接过 那件长衫吧。他大声说："不能不承认，咱们刚进来的时候，那副样子确实 容易引起人家的怀疑。我完全相信，正像这位好老板娘所说的，她是为了 维护她这客栈的名声才这么做的。”
"是呀，这可是实话，"老板娘说，"这位是上等人，说话毕竟像个上等 人，这是明摆着的。人人都知道我们是一家顶规矩的客栈，在这条大道上 名声比哪家也不差。不是我自己夸口，无论爱尔兰还是英国最上流的人， 都在我们这儿歇脚。我敢说，没人能抓我们一点儿把柄。刚才我不是说了 吗，要是先前我料到您就是您的话，太太，就是烧了我的指头我也不会冒 犯您的。可是说实话，既然承上等人光顾，来这儿花钱住客栈，我决不能 让一帮邋里邋遢的穷癞子玷污了他们。这种人不论走到哪里，钱掏不出几 个，虱子却丢下一大堆，他们引不起我一点点怜悯。可怜这种人才是傻瓜 哩。要是咱们法院认真办事的话，早该拿鞭子把他们赶到国外去啦。这么 对付他们最合适不过了。至于您，夫人，我打心坎里为您遭的不幸难过。 要是在您的衣服没来到以前，夫人肯赏脸先穿一下我的衣服，我所有的最 好的衣服都任凭您挑选。”
究竟是由于寒冷、羞耻还是由于琼斯先生的劝导，我不能断言；总 之，沃特尔太太听完老板娘这话气就消了，她随这女人一道穿衣服去，好 把自己打扮得体面一些。
客栈老板也对琼斯滔滔不绝地说起话来，可是这位宽宏大量的年轻人 马上把他拦住，并热烈地握了握他的手，让他确信决不再计较既往的事 了。琼斯对他说："好朋友，如果您认为满意，请相信，我也感到满意 了。"其实，在某种意义上说，更有理由感到满意的是老板，因为他饱尝了 琼斯一顿棍子，而琼斯几乎一下也没挨着。
巴特里奇一直都在水泵边冲着他那鲜血淋漓的鼻子。正当琼斯和老板 在厨房里握手的时际，他走了进来。巴特里奇素性平和，看到双方言归于 好的情景，自是十分高兴。尽管苏珊的拳头在他脸上留下了一些印记，还 抓破了好多处，但是他宁愿就此结束战斗，也不愿再动干戈来决一胜负。
勇猛的苏珊对她取得的战果也心满意足了，尽管她的一只眼睛给打青 了一一那是巴特里奇刚一交手时打中的。因此，两人之间也议和了。刚才 还是战争工具的两双手，这时却成为和平的媒介了。
于是，争吵就这样完全平息下来。尽管这与军士的职业背道而驰，但 是他也表示赞同。"喏，这才是友好的态度，"他说，"妈的，我顶讨厌有些 人交过手以后肚子里还记着仇恨。朋友之间要是有了争吵，那就只能采取 人们所谓的公平、友善的办法来解决：根据双方的喜爱，可以任选拳头、 刀剑或是手枪来拼它一场，然后事情就过去了。拿我来说，越是跟朋友交 手的时候我越爱他。记仇就不是英国人，那就像个法国佬啦。”
然后他提议，作为缔结这种和约不可缺少的一部分程序，举行一次奠 酒仪式。读者也许认为军士必然精通古代历史。这一点虽颇有可能，可是 既然他并没援引史籍来指明这个仪式的渊源，我也就不去妄加断言了。看 来他这个高见是颇有些来历的，因为他一再大声赌咒说，这个仪式是非举 行不可的。
琼斯一听到这个提议，立即对博学的军士表示赞同。他向店家要了一 只大碗，或者说，一只大酒罐来，装满奠祭时用的酒，然后他自己首先行 起这个仪式。他让老板握住自己的右手，左手举杯，照例说了几句这种场 合应说的话，然后就奠酒。随后，在场的大家都照样行了礼。全部仪式和 古今史家所记载的奠酒礼大同小异，确实没有必要在这里详细描述。主要 的区别只在于：第一，当前行的奠酒仪式只是把酒泼到自己的喉咙里去； 其次，主持祭礼的军士最末一个饮，不过我相信他是照古礼行事的，因为 他喝的比旁人都多，而且唯有他一个人只出面司仪，却不分担酒账。
这时，这伙好人围炉而坐，四周是一片和睦气氛。巴特里奇不但忘记 了自己可耻的败仗，由饥生渴，不久就又变得十分滑稽起来。但是我们得 暂时辞别这些欢聚一堂的人，陪琼斯先生到沃特尔太太房里走上一遭。这 时，琼斯先生所叫的那桌菜已经摆好了。其实，那并不需要多少时候来准 备的，因为三天以前菜就已经烹调停当，只消叫厨师把它回回锅就成了。
第五章
为所有胃口好的英雄们表白几句;描绘一场情场激战
尽管谄媚者会使英雄好汉变得自命不凡，或者在世人眼中他们也会显 得崇高，然而在他们身上毕竟还是凡人的成分多于神的成分。不论他们心 灵有多么高尚，肉体（而那是最主要的部分）还是免不了有严重的弱点， 仍然要受到人类本性中最卑劣的需求所支配，其中之一就是饮食。在有些 聪明人看来，吃饭这件事是再低级不过了，实在有伤圣哲尊严；然而即使 世上最伟大的君王、豪杰或哲学家，在一定程度上也非干这件事不可。造 物有时甚至还故意开玩笑，迫使这些尊贵的人物吃得比最下等的人还要 多。
老实说，既然地球上还不曾有哪个居民真超出凡人，那么谁也用不着 为了顺从人的需求而感到羞耻。然而如果我前边提及的那些大人物企图独 自垄断这类低级活动一一比如说用囤积或毁坏食物的办法使旁人会吃不上 饭，那他们就肯定是十分卑鄙下流了。
讲完这几句开场白之后，如果我们提到本书的主人公这时食欲很旺 盛，我想也算不得毁谤他吧。在《奥德修纪》这首歌咏饮食的诗篇的人物 中，尤利西斯的胃口要算最好了。可是我怀疑他是否吃得有琼斯先生那么 痛快。曾经长在一头公牛身上的肉，此刻至少有三磅已经荣幸地成为琼斯 先生身体的一部分了。
我们所以不得不提到这一细节，是为了说明何以这位主人公暂时没去 理会他的女伴。她吃得很少，脑子里在想着另一种性质的事情。琼斯在完 全满足一昼夜的斋戒为他造成的食欲之前，丝毫也没理会到这一点；可是 刚一吃完饭，他的注意便立刻转了过去。下面就来说说他现在的注意所 在。
迄今为止，我们还很少谈到琼斯先生形体的完美。实际上，他是世上 最漂亮不过的一个小伙子。他的面容不但丰盈健康，而且极其显著地流露 着温柔、善良的神态。他眼睛里闪耀着的那种活泼和敏锐，虽然一个有眼 力的人必然看得出来，而粗心人可能忽略过去，但是从他的眼睛里强烈地 流露出来的善良的神情，却是几乎人人一见到他都立刻会注意到的。
由于以上这一点，或者也由于皮肤的细润，使得他脸上显出一股难以 形容的秀气。倘若他不是兼有一副魁伟的身材和英俊的仪表（他的英姿不
亚于赫拉克勒斯，而美貌又堪与阿多尼斯相比），他也许会长得太女人气 一些了。同时，他的举止活泼而文雅、愉快而和蔼。他浑身都是活力，有 他在场，就使所有的对话生气勃勃起来。
倘若读者把这位主人公身上的这许许多多惹人爱的地方都考虑到了， 再想想沃特尔太太不久以前欠下琼斯先生的那份人情，还会由于她对琼斯 怀有好感而对她产生反感，那就算不得坦率，而迹近假正经了。
不管人们怎样指摘她，我的职责仍在于把事实真相忠实地叙述出来。 老实说吧，沃特尔太太对我们这位主人公不但有了好感，甚至对他还十分 喜爱。讲得更露骨一些，她爱上琼斯了。按照时下对这个字眼儿普遍的理 解，爱可以毫无区别地应用于一切能满足我们的情欲、食欲或官能的东 西，也就是对某种食品的偏爱。
尽管对种种不同的对象爱是一个样的，然而表现的方式却各有不同。 不论对一块滋味鲜美的牛腰肉、一瓶布尔戈尼红葡萄酒、一朵粉色的玫瑰 花、一把克雷莫纳四产的提琴多么喜爱，我们也不会用笑容、媚眼、漂亮的 服饰或阿谀的言词去取得牛腰肉等等的欢心的。诚然，有时我们也会叹上 一口气，然而一般也只是由于弄不到那些可爱的东西，而决不是面对着它 们的时候，否则我们也许就会像帕丝芙丝抱怨她那条公牛那样责怪那些东西 装聋作哑、无情无义了。帕丝芙为了博取公牛的好感，曾卖尽风情；如果 在客厅里把这种风情运用到感觉远比公牛敏锐、心肠远比公牛绵软的上流 绅士身上，原是可以奏奇效的。
然而人类男女之间的爱却恰恰相反。一旦发生了爱情，我们心里想的 主要就是如何赢得对方的好感。不然的话，年轻人学习那显出娇媚的本领 还能有什么用呢？倘若修饰和美化人体的行业目的不在于使顾客获得爱 情，我想从事这种行业的人恐怕就无法维持生计。那样一来，一切从事修 饰我们外表的大师（据说他们主要教导我们如何与禽兽有别），甚至连舞 蹈教师，也将为社会所摒弃了。总之一句话，上流闺秀和少爷们从旁人身 上学来的一切优美的仪态以及他们利用镜子为自己所增添的姿容，实际上 都不过是奥维德所经常说的spicula et faces amoris四，或者如我们有时 所说的，爱情的全部炮火。
沃特尔太太和我们这位主人公刚一坐下，这位太太就朝琼斯先生开起 爱情的炮火来了。这里，我们打算从事一种不论在诗歌还是散文方面从来
还没尝试过的描绘。我想此刻理应邀请几位仙女前来协助，我相信她们一 定会欣然降临的。
“啊，请告诉我吧，葛瑞斯三姊妹四，你们住在赛拉芬如容颜的天宫 里，朝夕在她跟前，你们是真正的仙人，十分懂得一切迷人的媚术。那么 沃特尔太太是使用什么武器来夺取琼斯先生那颗心的呢？
“首先是用她那双可爱的蓝眼睛。从一对亮晶晶的眸子里像闪电般射出 的两道秋波。幸而这目光只射中了琼斯先生正往自己盘子里搬运的一大块 牛肉上，没伤着什么，火力就消散了。这位女战士看到目标没打中，登时 从酥胸中发出一声长叹。谁听到这声叹息也不能无动于衷，那股勤儿足够 令十二个花花公子倾倒的，是那般温存，那般甜蜜，那般多情，倘若我们 的主人公这时不是正在倒一瓶啤酒，粗大的咕嘟咕嘟声堵住了他的耳朵， 他一定会听到那委婉动听的叹息的。她还试用了旁的许多武器，可是口腹 之神（我不敢确信有这么一位神祇，不过倘若有这么一位神祇的话）保全 了他这位信士弟子。可是这也许不是个dignus vindice nodus丝］,琼斯此 刻所以能安然无恙，也许是由于自然方面的原因。既然爱情常能保护我们 免受到饥饿的侵袭，在有些情况下，饥饿或许也能帮助我们抵御爱情的进 攻。
"那位美人经过几度失望，生起气来。她决定暂时休战一下，利用这段 间歇备好各种爱情武器，以便饭后再次发动攻势。
"因此，餐巾一撤，她立即重新作战。她先用右眼对着琼斯先生的侧翼 瞄准，然后从眼角射出锐不可当的一瞥。尽管这一瞥在射到我们这位主人 公身上之前，力量已经消失大半，然而也并非毫无效果。美人也看出这 点，急忙撤回视线，垂下眼睑，好像为刚才这一着感到很不安的样子。其 实，她这样做只不过是为了诱使琼斯放松警戒，叫他睁开眼睛，从而好偷 袭他的心房。这时，她悄悄抬起一双已经使可怜的琼斯动心的亮晶晶的眼 睛，把整个面庞上的诸般妩媚，全在一笑之中发射出来。这不是喜悦的 笑，也不是高兴的笑，而是多情的笑。绝大多数妇人随时都能做出这种笑 容，借此能同时表现她们和蔼的性格、俊美的酒涡和雪白的牙齿。
"这一笑正击中我们这位主人公的眼睛，使他立即脚下晃晃悠悠起来。 他开始察觉出对方的意图，并且确实感到那意图已经奏效。于是，交战双 方开始谈判。在谈判时，美人儿+分巧妙而且不动声色地继续进攻，因 此，在她再度发动攻势以前，她就差不多已经征服了我们这位主人公的
心。老实说，琼斯先生所进行的恐怕只是一种假作姿态的防御战，他背信 弃义，不去充分衡量和美丽的苏菲亚缔结的盟约，将要塞双手献给了对 方。一句话，这场爱情上的谈判一告结束，那位夫人就漫不经心地让自己 颈上的帕子坠在地上而露出了皇家炮台。于是，琼斯先生的心也就立即完 全被俘，而这位妩媚的征服者也就一如过去，享受着胜利的果实。”
葛瑞斯姊妹认为她们的叙述到此理应结束，我们想本章到此也该结束 了。

第六章
厨房里一席友好的谈话，谈话的结尾虽然不很友好，却很寻常
正当这对情侣如上章略加描绘的那样寻欢作乐的时候，他们也让厨房 里那几个好朋友得到消遣解闷。这话包含着两重意思：一方面供给了他们 聊天的资料，同时也供应了提神的饮料。
这时，围在厨房炉畔的，除了有时走来走去的老板和老板娘，还有巴 特里奇先生、军士和替那位小姐和女仆赶马车的车夫。
巴特里奇先告诉大家他从山中人口里听到的关于琼斯发现沃特尔太太 时的情景，军士于是就把他所晓得的关于这位太太的身世讲了出来，说她 是他们联队里沃特尔大尉的妻子，她时常到兵营里去陪伴丈夫。"确实也有 些人怀疑他们是否是在教堂里行过婚礼的正式夫妻，"他说，"不过，这不 干我的事。我必须承认，倘若要我郑重宣誓来作证的话，我认为沃特尔太 太比咱们高贵不了多少。要是雨天能出太阳，我想大尉也就能升天堂啦。 即使他上得了天堂，那也无关紧要，反正他不会缺乏伴侣的。说句公道 话，这位太太是个好人，很爱惜我们当兵的，总是生怕我们受到什么委 屈。她曾替许多可怜的兵士求过情，按她的一片好心，一个兵士也不应受 到惩罚。然而在我们上次驻扎的地方，她和旗手诺塞顿确实很亲近。这的 确一点也不假。可是大尉完全不晓得。只要他那份儿也很充足，这又有什 么关系？他对这女人的爱丝毫也没有因此而减少。如果谁讲这女人一句坏 话，他准会用刀子把那人攮了。所以我决不会讲她什么坏话的。我只不过 重复一下旁人说过的话。要是人人都那么说，这其中一定有点道理。""是 呀，是呀，一定有很多道理，”巴特里奇大声说，“Veritas odium parit. 四""这全是瞎糟蹋人，"客栈老板娘说，“现时她已经穿戴整齐了，看上去 完全是一位高贵的太太；从举动来看，她也像一一她借我的衣服穿，就赏 了我一个基尼。"“可真是一位好太太，"老板大声说，“如果你不是太莽 撞，开头就不至于跟她闹起来的。"“你还来怪我！"她反驳说，“要不是你 这糊涂虫，本来什么事也不会发生的。跟你毫不相干的事你总爱插进来， 说些鬼话！”“得啦，得啦，"老板说，“已经发生的事反正也弥补不了啦， 那么就让它了结了吧。"“好，这回是了结啦，"老板娘嚷道，“可是以后你 要是再闹，能老这么弥补下去吗？我吃你这个傻瓜的苦头这可不是头一遭 了。但愿你在店里不再说东道西的。大内外头的事归你管，你要插手就尽
管去插手吧。你不记得七年前那回事吗？""喂，亲爱的，别翻老账啦，"老 板回答说，"算啦，算啦，事情总还是圆满地过去了。我惹了乱子，很抱 歉。"老板娘刚要还嘴，给喜欢做和事佬的军士拦住了 ；只是巴特里奇很不 乐意，他素来好开玩笑，总欢喜挑起一些只会产生喜剧而不会产生悲剧 的、无伤大雅的小风波。
军士问巴特里奇跟他的主人要到哪里去。"他并不是我主人，"巴特里 奇回答说，"请你相信，我也不是谁的仆人。尽管我时运不济，然而我也是 个绅士。别瞧我眼下显得又穷又呆头呆脑的，当年我还在中学里教过书 呢。Sed hei mihi ! non sum quod fuE]” "先生，希望您别见怪，”军 士说，"如果我可以冒昧问一声的话，您和令友这是要到哪里去呀？”"这回 你称呼对啦，”巴特里奇说，“Amici sumus.四我还可以说，我这位朋友是 英国数一数二的大绅士……”（听到这话，老板和老板娘立刻都竖起耳 朵。）“他是乡绅奥尔华绥的继承人。”“什么，就是那位到处乐善好施的乡 绅奥尔华绥吗？，，老板娘大声嚷道。“正是他，，，巴特里奇回答说。“那么我 敢说，他日后一定会继承一份了不起的财产，”老板娘说。“那是一定 的，”巴特里奇回答说。“真是的，我一见到他马上就认出他是位上流 人，”老板娘说，“可是我丈夫却硬装得比谁都聪明。”“亲爱的，我承认是 弄错啦，”老板嚷道。“哼，弄错啦！ ”她说，“可是你几时见到我这么弄错 过？”“可是，先生，”老板大声说，“他既然是一位大乡绅，出门怎么连牲 口都不骑？ ”“这也很难说，”巴特里奇回答道，“大乡绅有时候脾气来得 怪。眼下在格洛斯特他有十二匹马，还有十二个仆人；可是他什么也不中 意。昨天晚上天很热，他一定要到那座高山上去散步，乘乘凉。于是，我 就陪他一道去。但是我再也不会到那地方去了，我一辈子还没那么吓着 过。我们遇见一个顶奇怪的人。”“我拿脑袋打赌，”老板嚷道，“那准是山 中人，大家都这么叫他。也许他真是个人，不过我知道有些人相信住在那 儿的是个魔鬼。”“是的，像极啦，像极啦，”巴特里奇说，“现在经你这么 一提醒，我确确实实相信那是个魔鬼一一尽管我没看见他的蹄子。魔鬼要 变成什么形状都可以办到，说不定他能施法术把蹄子藏起来呢。”“先生， 希望您别生气，”军士说，“请问，魔鬼是个什么样子？我们有些军官说， 根本没有魔鬼这种东西，都是牧师们捏造出来的，是为了避免砸掉他们的 饭碗。因为倘若大家全晓得根本没有什么魔鬼，牧师就会像太平年月的军 人一样，毫无用场啦。”“我想您那些军官必然都是饱学之士吧，”巴特里奇
说。"饱什么学！"军士回答说，"尽管那些军官中间还有一个大尉，我敢说 他们肚子里还没有您一半的学问呢。无论他们怎么说，我总认为必然有魔 鬼。我想，要是没有魔鬼的话，坏人怎么会找到他门上去呢？这些话我都 是从一本书里读到的。皿你们军官中间总有人会发现确实有魔鬼，"老板 说，"而且他们应该感到丢脸。我相信魔鬼一定会给欠我的账不还的人一些 报应的。有个军官在我这儿住了整整半年，虽然在客栈里他每天连一个先 令都舍不得花，可是他却昧着良心占用我们最好的一张床位，并且还纵容 他的部下在厨房的灶上炖白菜一一因为礼拜天我向来不给他们开中饭。每 个好基督教徒都应该赞成有个魔鬼，这样才好惩治像他这种坏蛋。""住嘴 吧，老板，"军士说，"别骂军人，不然的话我是不会答应的。""去他妈的 军人！"老板说，"我吃够他们的亏了。""诸位给做个见证，"军士说，"他 辱骂国王，那是叛国行为。皿我几时骂过国王！你这个痞子，"老板 说。"你骂国王啦，"军士嚷嚷着。"你骂了军人，那就是骂了国王。这完全 是一回事。凡是骂军人的人，如果有胆子的话，就一定也会骂国王。所以 这完全是一回事。皿对不起，军士先生，”巴特里奇说，"这可是non sequituF四。皿别再讲你那外国话，"军曹从座位上跳起来说，"我不能安安 静静地坐在这儿听你辱骂军人。""朋友，你误会啦，"巴特里奇嚷道，"我 决没意思辱骂军人。我只是说你那个结论是non sequitur。"“你自己才是个 sequitur呢！”军士嚷道，“你是个不折不扣的sequitur。你们全是一群浑 蛋，我可以证明。你们中间顶有本领的站出来，跟我较量较量，咱们赌二 十镑。"这个挑战有效地封住了巴特里奇的嘴巴。他刚饱尝过一顿拳头，胃 口还没缓过来。但是那位车夫身上没那么疼，打架的瘾头比巴特里奇也大 些，就不那么甘心忍受侮辱一一他认为军士的辱骂至少有他的一份。于 是，他就跳了起来，朝军士走去；嘴里还赌着咒说，他认为自己不比军队 里哪个差一些，愿意以一基尼为赌头，和军士斗斗拳。军士接受了斗拳的 提议，但是拒绝了那赌头。说着两个人就脱了衣服，交起手来。最后那个 赶马的被那个带兵的打得个落花流水，就只剩下一点点向对方告饶的气力 了。
这时，那位年轻的女客想动身了，吩咐把车套好。可是一切都是徒 然，那天晚上车夫无力来执行他的职务了。一位古代的异教徒也许会认为 在车夫失职的问题上，酒神所负的责任决不亚于战神。实际上，战斗的双 方对这两位神祇都供奉祭祀了。说得明白些，他们都喝得酩酊大醉，巴特
里奇的情况也好不了许多。至于老板，饮酒正是他的本行，酒灌到他的肚 子里，就跟灌到客栈的任何其他容器里一样没什么影响。
老板娘应琼斯先生和他的女伴的邀请来吃茶，她就把上面的事详详细 细地讲给他们听，并且对那位年轻的女客表示莫大的关怀。老板娘说："这 么一来她就走不成了，弄得她非常不安。她真是位又可爱又漂亮的小姐。 我从前一定见过她。我揣摩她准是爱上了什么人，这是从家里逃跑出来 的。谁知道，也许有一位少爷也怀着和她同样沉重的心情正等着她呢！”
琼斯听到她这番话，长叹了一声。尽管沃特尔太太理会到了，可是当 时有老板娘在，她不便说什么。等这位好女人走了之后，她才向我们这位 主人公表示，她料想琼斯心里强烈地爱着另外一个女人。不待琼斯直接回 答，只从他神色间的局促不安也足以使她相信自己猜得不错。她在爱情上 还不是那样挑剔，在发现对方另有所欢的时候就感到极其忧虑。琼斯的美 貌给她以莫大的眼福。她看不到琼斯的心，因而也不在那上头去劳神。在 爱情的桌上她只求饱餐一顿，并不去摹想有什么人在她之前尝过这份美 味，或者将有什么人继她之后来尝这同一桌美味。她对情感虽不讲求细 腻，却在乎实惠。比起那些只要旁人不能染指，即使自己不占有也心甘情 愿的女人来，沃特尔太太的这种欲念没那么难以捉摸，也没那么狠毒、自 私。
第七章
关于沃特尔太太更详尽的介绍，以及她是怎样落到琼斯搭救她时所 处的不幸境地的
尽管造物决不会在每个人的气质里掺和等量的好奇心和虚荣心，可是 世上恐怕不会有人分到的竟是那样少，以致他不需要什么技巧，不费什么 周折就能把二者克制或隐藏起来一一然而对任何一位称得起聪颖或者教养 好的人，这种控制是必不可少的。
琼斯是在一种不同寻常的情景下发现沃特尔太太的，这就必然引起了 他的好奇心。不过他称得起是位有教养的人，他压住了自己的全部好奇 心。开头，他也曾给那位太太一些暗示，可是他看出沃特尔太太有意对他 的探索避而不答，也就甘愿蒙在鼓里了，特别是，他也不免怀疑到倘若要 这位太太把一切事实都讲出来，有些情节定会使她不好意思的。
然而本书读者中间也许有人不那么容易安于蒙在鼓里。为了让大家满 意，我们就格外费些周折，把真相打听了来，用这段情节来结束本卷。
这位太太曾经同一位沃特尔大尉同居过几年。他正是诺塞顿先生所隶 属的那个部队的大尉。她就充作大尉的妻室，顶着他的姓氏。可是正像军 士所说的，他们究竟是否正式夫妻，还略有疑问。这个问题我们姑且不去 追究。
说来可惜，沃特尔太太早些日子就和前述那位旗手有了密切的关系， 这件事对她的名声并不大好。毫无疑问，她对那个小伙子很钟情，然而她 究竟是否曾让这种暧昧关系到达犯罪程度，还不十分清楚一一除非我们假 定只要女人对一个男人倾心，把一切都给了他，就不可能不把那一样也给 他。
沃特尔大尉所在的那个部队的联队比旗手诺塞顿先生的那支队伍早开 拔了两天。因此，就在琼斯和诺塞顿两人狭路相逢的第二天，沃特尔大尉 到达了沃斯特。
大尉和沃特尔太太事先约好，她只陪大尉走到沃斯特，然后在此分 手，她就从那里回到巴思，一直住到讨伐叛军的冬季战役结束为止。
诺塞顿先生是知道这个协定的。老实说，那位太太正是约他在这个地 方相会，并且答应陪他在沃斯特一直住到联队开到的时候。至于她有何考
虑，目的何在，那就只好留给读者去揣度了。我们虽然有责任叙述事实， 却没有必要违背我们的本性，去贬损人类最娇艳的那部分。
诺塞顿一经从监禁中逃出来（如前面所述），就急忙去追赶沃特尔太 太。由于他是个精干、敏捷的小伙子，沃特尔大尉刚刚离开几个钟头，他 就赶到了沃斯特城。一见到沃特尔太太，就毫不踌躇地立刻把那件不幸的 事告诉了她一一他把事情确实说得像是他很倒霉，因为凡是他自己的错处 （至少在荣誉的法庭上可以算作他的错处的情节），完全都抽掉了，只剩 下一些在司法的法庭上颇可争辩的部分。
女人恋爱起来往往比男人猛烈，显得无私一一说来这倒确是她们的光 彩。她们一心一意只知谋求自己所爱的那个人的利益。因此，沃特尔太太 一了解到她的情人所处的险境，除了他的安全，旁的就一概不顾了。这正 中诺塞顿的下怀。于是，他们立刻进行了商议。
经过反复的商讨，决定旗手穿过村野到赫里福德，在那里他也许能找 到去威尔士某港埠的车，然后再想法逃到国外去。沃特尔太太表示愿意一 路陪伴他，并且还答应替他出路费一一对诺塞顿先生说来，这是一件十分 重要的条款。当时，沃特尔太太兜里有三张银行支票，共计九十镑；此外 还有些现款和手指上戴的一只颇为贵重的钻石戒指。她+分信任这个坏 人，把身边携带的这些钱财细软都告诉了他，万没料到竟会引起他打抢的 念头。要是他们从沃斯特搭驿车的话，追踪的人定然会发觉他们走的路 线，所以旗手提议先步行一段路，那位太太也同意了。天寒霜重，也宜于 走走。
沃特尔太太的行囊大部分已经运到巴思去了，她目前只携带了几件贴 身衣服，这也由诺塞顿一并放在他自己的口袋里了。这样，晚上他们就把 一切准备停当，第二天起个大早，五点钟就从沃斯特动身。当时离天亮还 差两个小时，一轮明月尽量为他们射出光芒。
有一种娇嫩女人，多亏有了车辆这项发明，才能把她们从一个地方载 到另一个地方，因而一辆马车成为她们日常必不可少的东西。沃特尔太太 可不是那种女人。她手脚灵敏，充满了活力；她的精神也同样活跃，走起 路来完全跟得上她那位健步如飞的情人。
他们沿着一条大道走了几哩一一诺塞顿说，人家告诉他那是通往赫里 福德的路。天刚破晓，两人来到一座大森林旁边。诺塞顿突然站住，假装 思虑什么，然后表示，继续沿着行人来往频繁的大道这样走下去恐怕不妥
当。他三言两语就说服了女伴，她就跟他折入一条看上去是径直穿过森林 的小径，最后来到马扎德山脚。
他当前这个卑鄙不堪的企图究竟是预先谋划的，还是一时心血来潮， 我不能断言。可是一来到这个杳无人迹、决不会有第三者干预的地方，他 就突然从腿上解下吊袜带，对那可怜的女人下毒手，打算干我们前边已交 代过的可恶而又可怕的勾当；幸而琼斯鬼使神差般地突然出现，才使他没 能得逞。
幸而沃特尔太太不是那种弱不禁风的女流之辈。一看到诺塞顿解下吊 袜带，听他说出他的恶毒企图，她就毅然自卫起来，一面不住声地呼救， 一面死命挣扎，拖延了好几分钟，使这坏蛋一时没法达到目的。正当她精 疲力竭、抵抗不住的时候，琼斯先生赶到了，把她从恶棍手中搭救出来。 她除了损失掉上身衣服，手上的钻石戒指在搏斗时滑脱或被诺塞顿夺去之 外，还没遭受旁的损失。
为了满足诸位读者的好奇心，我们曾不惮其烦地把这件事的原委探听 出来，以上就是探听到的结果。这里，在读者面前展现出的是一幅既愚蠢 而又恶毒的情景。倘使我们不是记起那个坏蛋当时认定自己犯下了人命 案，法律早已判处他死刑，就简直不能相信人竟能干出这种勾当。既然他 已经断定自己唯一的生路就是远走高飞，就想索性夺得这个可怜女人的钱 财和戒指，这样做倒可以补偿一下他良心上将增添的负担。
这里，我们要郑重敬告读者一下：千万不可因这一个坏蛋的卑劣行为 而责怪军队里所有的军官一一他们仍然是体面、可敬的。请大家不要忘记 这个旗手(正如我们早已告诉大家的)不论出身或所受的教养都不高，他 根本不配当一名军官。因此，倘若除他之外，还有人也应对他这种下流行 径负责的话，那就只有当初委任他军职的那个人了。

第一章
本章包括一些教训，当代批评家颇需要细读一番
读者，我们无法晓得你是怎样的人。也许你像莎士比亚那样熟悉人 性，也许你比莎士比亚的某些编校者也高明不了多少。唯恐是后一种情 况，所以在咱们共同继续前进之前，理应对你进几句有益的忠告，免得你 完全误解或歪曲我们，就像上述的编校者误解和歪曲莎士比亚一样。
首先，我们警告你不要迫不及待地去指摘我们这部历史中的任何事 件，认为它来得突兀，与总的布局不相干，因为你不可能立刻就理解那些 事件对总的布局会起什么样的作用。其实，这部作品可以看作是我们的一 个伟大创造，而批评家不过是条小小的爬虫。在他未曾晓得这部作品前后 是如何连贯起来的，也还不知道故事的最后收场之前，就胆敢对其中某一 部分胡乱挑剔；这真是荒谬、狂妄到了极点。我们必须承认，我们在此处 对批评家们所使用的暗讽和比喻重得没边儿了，然而此外也实在找不到更 适当的提法来表明第一流作家与末流批评家之间的差别。
其次，我们还要警告你，我的好爬虫，不要乱说什么本书的某一人物 像煞另外一个人物；例如说出现在第七卷和第九卷里的两个客栈老板娘似 乎大同小异。朋友，你应当知道，有些特征是各行各业大多数人所共有 的。一个好作家，其本领正在于能够保有这些特征而在运用时又能使之各 有不同。再者，好作家还有这样一种本领：他能分辨出受同一罪恶或蠢举 推动的两个人物之间的细微差别。具备这后一种本领的作家寥寥无几，也 只有少数读者才真正辨识得出这种本领；虽然我深信，对于能够辨识的人 来说，这种发现就形成他读作品的一个很主要的乐趣。比如说，任何人都 看得出美食家马蒙爵士［1］和纨衿儿弗勒特爵士⑵是迥乎不同的，然而要分辨 纨衿儿弗勒特爵士与朝臣奈斯爵士 ［3］之间的区别就更需要明察秋毫的判断 力。正是由于缺乏这种判断力，粗俗的观众时常对剧院上演的戏做出极不 公道的事来。我就曾经知道有一位诗人［4］险些被当作窃贼判处。在法律上， 笔迹相仿是构不成什么罪证的，而对这位诗人的指控，比这还不足为凭。 事实上，我很担心舞台上出现的每个风流寡妇都会被指摘为盲目模仿黛 都，幸亏我们戏院里的这些批评家当中没有几个精通拉丁文的，还看不懂 维吉尔。
其次，我们还要警告你，可敬的朋友（因为也许你的心肠比你的头脑 要好些），不要由于一个人不够+全十美就说他坏。倘若你喜欢+全十美 的人物，那么时下有的是可以满足你这种嗜好的作品；然而我们涉世以来 从未遇到过那样的人，我们也就不想在本书里去写他。老实说，我很怀疑 凡人是否曾达到过那样尽善尽美的境地，也怀疑世上可曾有过像玉外纳所 描绘的那种坏透了的怪物：
--nulla virtute redemptum
A vitiis-
完全是罪恶，没有一件美德来冲淡。
其实，在一部虚构的作品里插进这么个天使般的完美人物或魔鬼般的下流 货，我看不出有什么好处，因为人们读到这两种人物，思考之余，就会悲 伤不已或羞愧难当，却不会从这些榜样中获得任何教益。在前一种情形 下，当读者看到那样完美无缺的人物时，就会由于自己无法企及而担忧惭 愧；而当他看到后一种人物时，发现自己身上也具有的天性竟然可以堕落 成为那样可憎可恶的家伙，心里自然也同样会感到惶惶不安。
事实上，只要一个人物的品格里有一些善良的成分，足以引起好心人 的钦佩和爱戴，即使有一些小小的quas humana parum cavit natura[5] 瑕疵，它们仍然会激起我们的同情而不是憎恶。其实，再没有比在这种人 身上看到的缺陷更有助于提高道德的了，因为那些缺陷会造成一种惊骇之 感，比起邪恶透顶的坏蛋所犯的过失对我们更能发生作用，长久在我们脑 际萦回。在一个具有很多善良成分的人身上，弱点和罪恶就更惹人注目， 他的美德将其衬托得更为鲜明，暴露其丑态。当我们看到这些罪孽给我们 所喜爱的人物所带来的恶果时，我们就不但受到教育，为了自己以后避免 这些罪恶，并且还由于它们贻害于我们所喜爱的人物而对其深恶痛绝。
那么，朋友，向你讲完这几点忠告以后，倘若你愿意的话，就随着这 部历史与我们一道前进吧。
第二章
来了一位爱尔兰绅士。随后，客栈里发生了一些颇不寻常的事
那战战兢兢的小野兔，由于害怕种种仇敌，其中主要是人，那个狡 黠、残忍、食肉的动物，整天都一直躲在隐蔽的地方；这时，它尽情地在 草地上嬉戏着。这时，猫头鹰，那尖声尖气的夜间歌手，在空心的树上唱 出那也许会使当代有些音乐鉴赏家听了为之神往的歌儿。这时，那醉意朦 胧的庄稼汉在回家途中脚步蹒跚地走过教堂的院子（或者不如说是坟 地），恐怖感在他的头脑里勾勒出一个血淋淋的鬼魂。这时，贼盗和恶棍 醒来了，而老实的巡卒却酣然入梦。明白说吧，这正是午夜时分。旅馆里 的人，不论本书前边已经提过的，或是到夜晚又来到的，都已入睡。只剩 下女仆苏珊还在那里忙来忙去一一她必须把厨房的东西全刷洗干净，才能 回到那个等待着她的多情驿夫的怀抱中。
就在这样的情景下，一位绅士匆匆忙忙来到旅馆。他立刻下了马，来 到苏珊跟前，神情唐突而且张皇失措，急得几乎上气不接下气地问女仆， 旅馆里住的可有一位女客？天这么晚了，而这个直勾勾地一直瞪着她的男 人举止又是这么可疑，苏珊不免感到有些吃惊，所以在回答之前，先踌躇 了一阵子。看到这般光景，这位绅士更加恳切地央求女仆告诉他真实情 况，说他的妻子失踪了，现在正来寻找她。"咳，有两三回我差一点儿抓到 她，"这人喊道，"可是就在我来到之前，她走了。要是她住在这家旅馆的 话，就请你悄悄把我领到她跟前。要是她已经走掉了的话，就请你告诉我 从哪条路上可以追到她。向你发誓，我一定叫你这个穷姑娘成为全国最阔 的人。"说着，他就掏出一把基尼。一个比这个穷女仆身份高得多的人，看 到这样厚重的贿赂，也一定肯去干比这绅士所委托的低贱多了的勾当的。
苏珊根据她所晓得的一些关于沃特尔太太的情况，断定这位绅士必是 她的丈夫，而她也必然就是这位绅士所寻找的迷途羔羊。她认为把本夫的 妻子归还给本夫而赚到一笔钱，这钱赚得再诚实不过了。理由既然如此充 足，她就毫不踌躇地告诉绅士说，他找的那位太太此刻正住在客栈里。于 是，苏珊立刻在绅士的怂恿下（他答应事后必有重酬，而且一部分钱已经 真交到她手里了），把他领到沃特尔太太的卧室去。
在上流社会里，长久以来就建立起一种习惯，而且也有确凿可靠的理 由：丈夫不先敲门，不得走进妻子的房间。只要稍懂人情世故的读者，对
这个习惯的诸般妙处，必然都不点自明。这么一来，夫人就来得及打扮一 下，或者把一些讨厌的东西拿开，因为有些情况是细致、考究的女人所不 愿为丈夫撞见的。
老实说，有教养的人们中间所树立的一些规矩，一般看来似乎只是些 空头虚礼，仔细想想却感到大有必要。此刻，倘若我们这位绅士遵守上述 那个习惯该有多好啊。诚然，他也敲了门，但并不像他此刻应当采取的那 种轻轻的敲法。相反，当他发现房内从里边锁上了时，就使勤去撞。门登 时撞开了，他一头栽进屋里。
他刚从地上站起来，我们的主人公本人（说来既可耻又可悲）就也从 床上跳下来，声色俱厉地问他是什么人，竟敢这么放肆地闯进他的房间。
最初，那位绅士以为弄错了，正要道歉退出；忽然，借着明亮的月光 看到地板上乱七八糟地放着胸衣、长衫、衬裙、女帽、发带、长袜、吊袜 带、鞋、木屐等等。这一切东西燃起了他天生的妒火，气得他话都说不上 来了。他没理睬琼斯的质问，径直朝床铺走去。
琼斯立刻挡住他的去路。于是引起一场剧烈的争吵，两人很快就动起 手来。这时，沃特尔太太（我们不得不承认她也睡在同一张床上）也许刚 从梦中醒来，看到两个男人在她的卧房里打架，就拼命喊：杀人啦！有贼 啦！（喊得次数尤其多的是）强奸啦！也许有些人会奇怪她怎么嚷起“强 奸"来呢？其实，女人在恐惧时的这些喊叫声有如音乐上的发啦啦啦哒，只 作为声音的媒介，并没有什么明确的含义。
沃特尔太太的隔壁睡着一位爱尔兰绅士，因为他来到客栈时已经很晚 了，我们没来得及提到他。这位绅士就是爱尔兰人所称的那种好汉，或者 说，骑士。他是一户殷实人家的二儿子，因为家里没有财产可以继承，只 好出来另外开创一份家业。如今，他正是为此而前往巴思，想试试他的赌 运和桃花运。
这个小伙子躺在床上读班夫人［6］的一部小说，因为曾经有一位朋友告诉 他，再没有比依靠阅读些优秀文学作品来增进知识，充实心灵，更有助于 博得女人欢心的了。因此，他刚一听见隔壁吵吵嚷嚷，就从床上跳下来， —手持剑，另一只手抄起身边点着的蜡烛，径直朝沃特尔太太的房间奔 来。
倘若沃特尔太太乍看到这位只穿着衬衫的男人，越发感到有失体统， 她这种担忧马上也就消释了大部分，因为这位骑士一进门就嚷道："费兹帕
特利先生，你这是在干什么！"那个男人听了马上回答说："啊，麦克拉契 兰先生，在这儿遇到你，太好啦。这个坏蛋勾引上我的老婆，和她在一起 睡觉哩。""什么老婆不老婆的！"麦克拉契兰大声喊，"难道我还不认得费 兹帕特利太太！难道我还看不出跟这位穿衬衫的先生同床睡的人根本不是 她！”
这时，费兹帕特利朝这位太太瞥了一眼，又从她的声音（他就是站得 再远也应该分辨得出来）发觉自己不幸弄错了，就向她道歉。然后，他掉 过身来对琼斯说："你听着，我可不向你赔礼，因为你打了我。明天早晨我 一定要让你吃点苦头。”
琼斯听到这番恫吓，只报以轻蔑的神情，而麦克拉契兰先生却说 道："其实，费兹帕特利先生，这么深更半夜的，你打扰了人家，自己也该 感到惭愧。要不是旅馆里的人都睡熟了，就一定全会像我这样被你吵起来 的。这位先生打得好。凭良心说，我虽然还没娶妻，要是我有妻子而你这 么对待她，我非割断你的喉咙不可。”
琼斯由于担心沃特尔太太的名声，正窘得不知该说什么或干什么好。 可是正像我们指出的，女人要远比男人来得随机应变。沃特尔太太记起她 的房间和琼斯先生的房间是通着的，于是，就凭着自己的胆子，并且指望 着琼斯凭信义替她撑腰，就回答说："你们这些话是什么意思？这群流氓！ 你们哪个也不是我的丈夫。救命啊！强奸啦！杀人啦！强奸啦！"这时，客 栈老板娘赶到房里来。沃特尔太太马上就以最刻毒的口吻说，她本以为住 的是一家规规矩矩的客栈，而不是个窑子。可是现在一群流氓竟然冲到她 房间里来，存心想破坏她的名誉，甚至要伤害她的生命。她说，名誉和生 命对她都同样是宝贵的。
这时，老板娘也吼叫起来，声音跟床上那个可怜的女人方才发出的一 样大。她嚷道，这下她完蛋啦。这家客栈的名声一向干干净净，如今可完 全被他们糟蹋了。说完之后，她掉过身来责问那些男人说："你们凭什么跑 到这位太太房间里来胡搅？”费兹帕特利低下头来一再说，他搞错了，非常 对不起，然后就跟他的同乡一道走开了。琼斯为人机警，当然领会了他这 位美人儿给他的暗示，就理直气壮地说：他听到有人破门而入，就赶来帮 这位太太的忙；至于他们为什么会砸破她的门，他实在想不出；倘若他们 想抢劫，总算幸而被他阻挡住了。"从开店以来，这儿就没闹过强盗，"老 板娘嚷道，"告诉您，先生，我这店里不窝藏强盗，尽管我嘴巴上老说，可
我恨透这两个字了。我这店里只欢迎正派、规矩的上等人。谢天谢地，这 类客人我有的是，足够我张罗的。在我这儿下榻过的贵族有……"于是，她 就背出一长串姓名和爵号来，那些名号，这里只好从略，以免有侵犯特权 之嫌。
琼斯硬着头皮听了下去，最后打断她的话，转而向沃特尔太太道歉， 说自己衣衫不整，不过只是为了急于营救她才这么奔了出来的。读者可以 设想她听到这番话之后所作的表示，而且倘若考虑到她此刻扮演的是一位 端庄的夫人，夤夜被三个闯进来的陌生男人吵醒，那么对她在这件事中的 全部举止神情也是不难推想的。她所担任的正是这样一个角色，而且她扮 演得真是惟妙惟肖，女演员也没有一个赛得过她的，不论在台上还是台 下。
从这件事我们可以得到充分的论据来证明，高尚品德对女人来说是多 么自然的事。也许一万个女人中难得有一个会演戏，甚至两个女演员扮起 同一角色来，轻易也不能演得同样好；然而一旦她们表演起贞洁人物来， 却都可以演得很好。不论本人贞洁不贞洁，莫不演得逼真。
当男人们全走开之后，沃特尔太太的恐惧和愠怒也平息下来了，她就 用和蔼得多的语调跟老板娘攀谈起来。老板娘则还在担心她这家客栈的名 声，为了维护这份名声，她又念叨起哪些显贵曾在她这里歇过宿。沃特尔 太太没让她啰嗦下去。她斩钉截铁地说，老板娘对刚才发生的事一点儿责 任也没有，然后就请老板娘离开，好让她去安眠，并且希望天亮以前再也 别来打扰她。听到这话，老板娘十分殷勤地连连行礼，就告退了。
第三章
老板娘和女仆苏珊之间的交谈，所有开客栈的及当伙计的都应一 读。来了一位漂亮小姐，从她的温厚举止中，有身份的人可以学得 怎样到处受人敬爱
老板娘记起内被砸开的时候，只有苏珊一个人还没睡，就立即去找 她，问她事情最初是怎么闹起来的，那位陌生的绅士是谁，他是什么时候 来的，是怎么来的。
苏珊就把读者早已了然的全部经过向她说了一遍，按照自己的方便， 改了某些情节，并且把她收下的那笔钱完全隐瞒住。老板娘一开头先对那 位太太颇表示同情，说她是担心旁人会破坏她的贞洁才那么害怕的。苏珊 为了让老板娘不要在这上头有什么不安，就赌咒说她亲眼看到琼斯是从沃 特尔太太的床上跳下来的。
老板娘听了大发雷霆。"你真是胡说八道！"她嚷道，"要是那样，一个 女人家还会那么大声喊叫，让人人都晓得！我相信足有二十个人可以证明 她喊叫了。请问，一个女人家除此之外还能拿出什么更好的证据来表明她 的清白？请你不要散布店里任何客人的这种坏话。因为这不但玷辱她们， 对店里也不光彩。咱们这家店里决不会有流氓或邪恶的叫花子进来。”
"这么说来，"苏珊说，"我别相信自己的眼睛啦。""对，眼睛有时候是 靠不住的。"老板娘回答说，"凡是对这些上等人不利的事情，我是不会相 信自己的眼睛的。昨儿晚上他们要的那桌菜，半年来我还没做过一次那么 好的买卖呢。他们真是满不在乎，脾气又那么随和。我把沃斯特郡的梨酒 当香槟卖给他们，人家一点儿也没挑剔什么。其实，我那梨酒味道好，又 滋补，比得过全英国最好的香槟，要不然我也不会卖给他们。他们足足喝 了我两瓶。不会的，不会的，我永远也不会相信这么规矩、正派的人会干 出什么坏事来。”
苏珊的话给堵回去了，于是，老板娘谈起旁的事情来。"你刚才说那位 先生是骑驿马来的，外面有个跟班的，跟马匹在一起。想必他也是位大老 爷。你怎么不问问他吃了饭没有？他大概在另外那位先生的房间里哪。去 问问他有没有叫人。如果他晓得店里还有人没睡，可以准备菜饭，也许他 会要点什么。可是别像往常那样乱说什么火也灭了，鸡鸭还没宰。如果他 要羊肉，可别瞎说咱们店里没有。我晓得肉铺老板在我上床之前刚宰了只
羊，倘若我需要的话，他总会乘热割一块给我的。去吧！记住，鸡、鸭、 羊肉，什么都有。打开门就问他，老爷，您刚才叫人了吗？要是他们什么 也不说，你就问，老爷，晚饭您想吃点什么？别忘记称他老爷。去吧。要 是这点事儿你全办不好，你就再也别想有什么出息啦。”
苏珊走了。过了不久，她跑回来说，两位老爷在一张床上睡了。"两位 老爷睡一张床！"老板娘说，"哪有那事。我敢说，他们一定是两个地地道 道的无赖汉。奥尔华绥少爷猜对了，那家伙一定是存心去抢沃特尔太太 的。他要是像上等人那样，砸那位太太的门是想干点风流事儿，他就决不 会溜到隔壁，省下一顿晚饭、一张床铺的开销。这两个一定是贼。找老婆 不过是个借口。”
老板娘这番斥责其实大大冤枉了费兹帕特利先生。尽管他是个穷光 蛋，但他确实生来就是上等人。他的心灵和头脑也许有点缺陷，然而却决 不是个偷偷摸摸的家伙或是吝啬鬼。实际上，他倒是个花钱十分大方的 人。他虽然和妻子一道得到一笔可观的产业，可是如今除了他妻子还有点 赡养金之外，已经花得一文不剩了。为了把那笔赡养金据为己有，他就虐 待起妻子来。加以他又极好吃醋，那可怜的女人实在忍无可忍，就逃跑 了。
这位绅士从彻斯特赶了一天的路，累得筋疲力尽，刚才打架时又饱尝 了一顿拳头，骨头酸痛，心里也更加痛楚起来，所以什么也不想下咽。刚 才根据女仆的话把沃特尔太太错认作自己的妻子，结果大失所望。他就没 想到尽管头一个撞错了，说不定妻子还是住在这家客栈里哪。于是，他就 听从朋友的劝告，当晚不再找下去了，并承那位先生的好意邀请，与他同 榻而眠。
那跟班的和马车夫的心境却两样。只要老板娘肯卖，他们倒是什么菜 都愿意要。不过，当她从这两个人口里了解到事实真相，确实晓得费兹帕 特利先生不是个贼之后，她才让步，并给他们端上些冷肉来。两人正在狼 吞虎咽的当儿，巴特里奇走进了厨房。最初，他是给上述那场纠纷吵醒 的。后来，他正打算重新入梦，一只猫头鹰扯着嗓子在他窗前为他唱了一 阵夜歌，吓得他马上跳下床，赶忙披上衣服；他听到厨房里有人讲话，就 跑下楼寻求做伴的来了。
他一来，老板娘又走不开了。本来她想叫苏珊照顾另外那两个客人， 自己去睡觉的，可是奥尔华绥少爷的朋友是不好怠慢的，特别是他已经招
呼给他烫半升葡萄酒。老板娘立刻答应了，在火上替他烫了半升梨酒一一 什么酒它都能顶替。
那个爱尔兰籍跟班的睡觉去了，马车夫也正要去睡。可是巴特里奇邀 他留下来一道喝点酒，那小伙子就十分感激地接受了他的邀请。其实，这 位塾师不敢一个人回去睡觉，又不晓得老板娘究竟能呆多大工夫，他就拿 定主意把这小伙子留下来；有他在跟前，就不怕魔鬼和它的喽啰的侵害 了。
这时，大门口又来了一名马车夫。老板娘让苏珊去看看。她让进两位 骑装打扮的年轻小姐，其中一位的衣服上镶着极其华丽的花边，巴特里奇 和那马车夫立刻从椅子上跳了下来，老板娘也赶紧上前行礼，殷勤招待。
那位盛装的小姐和蔼地笑了笑说："对不起，太太，请让我在您厨房的 炉边暖和一下。外面真是太冷了。可是我决不要打搅大家，请千万别离开 座位。"这话是指着巴特里奇说的，他看到小姐穿戴得这么富丽堂皇，吓得 蜷缩到房间另一角落里去了。其实，她理应受到更好的尊敬，因为她是世 上一位绝色美人。
小姐一再请巴特里奇回到原来的座位上，但是怎么劝他也不肯。于是 她脱下手套，伸出手来烤火一一那双手除了不会融化，凡是雪所有的特点 它们都具备了。她的同伴（其实是她的女仆）也脱下手套，露出的那一双 手，无论在冻僵的样子或是颜色上，都像煞冷牛肉片。
"小姐，"那女仆说，"今儿晚上您可别想再往前赶路啦。我真怕您累坏 身子。”
"当然哪，"老板娘大声说，"小姐决不会那样的。唉，我的天，今天晚 上还赶路！小姐，可别存这种念头吧一一不过，您也决不会再走的。小姐 晚饭想吃点什么？店里有各样羊肉，还有点嫩鸡。”
"恐怕该吃的不是晚饭，而是早饭啦，"小姐说，"可是我什么也吃不下 去。就是停下来，也只躺上一两个钟头。要是方便的话，太太，请给我一 杯葡萄乳汁吧，稀稀的，不要很多。”
"好吧，小姐，"老板娘大声说，"店里还有上好的白葡萄酒呢。""那么 说，你们这儿没有葡萄汁吧？”小姐说。"有的，"老板娘说，"只要您小姐 喜欢，全英国也找不出这样一一不过，无论如何您还是吃点什么吧。”
"讲老实话，我什么也吃不下，"小姐回答说，"您只要费心替我尽快把 房间准备好，我就感激不尽啦，因为不出三个钟头我就得骑上马继续赶
路。”
"喂，苏珊，"老板娘嚷道，"野鹅室里的火炉升起来没有？小姐，可惜 店里最好的房间全住满了。好几位上流客人现在都入睡了。这儿住着一位 年轻的大乡绅，还有好几位旁的高贵客人。"这时，苏珊告诉她，两位爱尔 兰绅士已经住进野鹅室里去了。
"岂有此理！"老板娘说，"你既然晓得天天都有上流客人到咱们店里 来，为什么不把最好的房间留几个？……那两位客人要是真有身份的话， 晓得是给您小姐腾，我相信他们一定会爬起来的。”
"千万可别为我这么麻烦，"小姐说，"谁也不要惊动！我只要一间普普 通通的房间，多么简陋也没关系。太太，请您千万别为我太费神。""唉， 小姐，"老板娘大声说，"店里是有几个好房间的，可是都不配给您住。既 然您肯屈尊，那么，苏珊，就立刻在玫瑰室里替小姐生起火来吧，这是现 有的最好的一间房了。您是先上楼，还是等火生好再上去我想已经暖 和过来了，"小姐回答说，"要是方便的话，那么此刻就上去吧。恐怕我让 大家，特别是那位先生（指巴特里奇）冻得太久了。真的，天这么冷得可 怕，叫人家离开火炉，我心里真是不安。"说完她就带着女仆走了，老板娘 举着一对蜡烛在前领路。
好妇人一回来，大家在厨房里就一致谈起那位小姐的可爱来了。无瑕 的美貌确实具有一种令任何人都无法抗拒的魅力。尽管老板娘由于这位女 客晚饭什么也不吃，很不高兴，然而她还是对大家说，一辈子还没见过这 么标致的人儿呢。巴特里奇满口称赞这位女客的姿容，对镶在她衣服上的 金边不禁也恭维了一番。驿夫则颂扬她的心肠仁厚。这时走进来的另一个 驿夫也异口同声地这么说："我敢说，她真是位好姑娘，连对哑巴畜生她都 怜恤。一路上她不时地问我：骑得那么快会不会伤了马。进店以后，她吩 咐我说，多弄些燕麦，让马尽量吃得足足的。”
和蔼的态度就含有这样的魅力，一定会使所有人都交口称赞。它可以 和著名的休赛太太［刀相比。就像那位太太一样，和蔼的态度可以突出每个女 人的优美风姿，遮住所有的疵瑕。这里，当读者见到和蔼的举止是多么可 爱时，我情不自禁地抒发了一下自己的感想。为了真实起见，下面我们得 用一个相反的例证来衬托。
第四章
-个秘方，服后保证招致千人嫌，万人恨
小姐刚躺到床上，她的侍女就跑回厨房来饱尝了小姐所谢绝的美味。
她走进厨房时，大家都站起来，像先前对小姐那样表示了敬意。可是 这位侍女忘记像她的女主人那样招呼大家仍旧坐下。其实，他们也没法再 坐下来，因为她把自己的椅子搬过来，差不多把整个火炉全占据了。她吩 咐立刻替她烤一只鸡，并且说，一刻钟之内要是烤不好，她就不等了。尽 管她要吃的那只鸡此刻还在窝里，而放到烤叉上之前还得经过捉、宰、去 毛种种手续，老板娘也还会答应按时办到的。无奈不幸客人现在已进入后 台，她能亲眼看见这场fourberie[8]的扮演，可怜的老板娘也就只好承认店 里没有鸡。"不过，太太，"她说，"我可以立时到肉铺里替您买点羊肉，肥 瘦都有。”
"你以为我有马的胃口吗？”这位丫头太太说，"深更半夜还吃得下羊 肉！你们这些开店的，总以为我们有身份的人跟你们一样。说真的，我就 猜在你们这个破地方，什么可口的也不用想吃到。我家小姐怎么单找这么 个店住下！我看你们这儿来的净是些生意人和赶牲口的吧。"老板娘听到这 番糟践她客店的话，真是心头火起。可是她仍然压住性子，只说了句："谢 天谢地，来住的总是上等人。""别对我说什么上等人，"女仆大声说，"我 总比你这种人懂得什么叫上等人吧。别再跟我废话啦，告诉我晚饭可以给 我点什么吃。马肉我虽然不能吃，可是我真饿啦。""唉，真的，太太，"老 板娘说，"您正赶上我什么都缺的时候。老实说吧，店里什么也没有，只有 一块冷牛肉，而且已经给一位绅士的跟班和驿夫吃得光剩骨头啦。""婆 娘，"亚比该也女士（为简便计，就这么称呼她吧）说，"你别叫我恶心啦。 我就是饿上一个月，也不会去吃那种人的指头碰过的东西。在这个讨厌的 地方，难道什么像样的、拿得出手的东西也没有了吗太太，来点儿鸡 蛋火腿怎么样？"老板娘问。"有新下的蛋吗？准是今天下的吗？火腿可得 切得细细薄薄的，又大又厚的我可咽不下去。你想法儿做得像点样子，别 以为是给个什么乡下婆子或是诸如此类的人做的。"于是，老板娘就抄起刀 来，但女仆又拦住她，说："好婆娘，你可得先洗洗手。我吃东西讲究，从 摇篮里就习惯什么都要高雅整洁。”
竭力在克制自己性子的老板娘开始张罗起来，至于苏珊，那女仆早就 不许她动手了，而且拒绝的时候满脸还带着那么藐视的神色。那个可怜人 好不容易才控制住自己的拳头，就像老板娘控制住舌头一样。其实，苏珊 并没完全控制住她的舌头。尽管只是在牙缝里嘟嚷着，她却说了些"浑蛋， 咱的血肉一点儿也不比你的低贱"一类的气话。
正做着晚饭，亚比该女士又后悔没吩咐店里把客厅的火生好。可是她 说现在也来不及了。她说："不过我不妨试试厨房的风味，我一辈子还不曾 在厨房吃过饭哩。"她掉转过来问两个驿夫为什么不留在马厩里陪着他们的 马。然后朝老板娘嚷道："婆娘，本来饭就这么难吃，起码也得把厨房弄干 净些，别围满了下等人呀。至于您，"她对巴特里奇说，"看来倒有点像个 上等人，高兴的话就不必走开了。我只惊动那些下流货。”
"对的，对的，太太，”巴特里奇大声说，"我是上等人。并且请您相 信，惊动我也不那么容易的。Non semper vox casualis est verbo nominativus.M”她以为这句拉丁文是对她的冒犯，就回敬说：“您也许是 个上等人，可是从您对女人讲拉丁文这件事看来，您可不大象。"巴特里奇 说了几句和气话，最后又说了一句拉丁文。这回，女仆只翘了翘鼻孔，挖 苦他是个大学者。
晚饭摆到桌上了。以这位亚比该女士那样高雅的人，吃起来可以称得 起是狼吞虎咽了。她一边吩咐照样再替她做一份，一边说："你们这家客栈 确实常有上流人来住吗？"
老板娘作了肯定的回答，说："店里眼下就住着不少有身份的上等人， 比如奥尔华绥少爷，那位先生是晓得的。”
"请问，这位年轻的上流绅士，这位奥尔华绥少爷是谁？”亚比该说。
"当然是萨默塞特郡的大乡绅奥尔华绥的儿子和继承人喽！"巴特里奇 回答说。
"哦，这可是怪事！"女仆说，"萨默塞特郡的这位奥尔华绥先生我很熟 悉，我晓得他跟前没有儿子呀！”
听到这话，老板娘竖起了耳朵，巴特里奇也有些发窘。不过，沉吟了 一下，他还是回答说："不错，太太，一般人都不晓得他是奥尔华绥先生的 儿子，因为那位乡绅并没跟孩子的母亲结过婚，然而他确实是奥尔华绥先 生的儿子，将来也就是他的继承人，这件事就像他名叫琼斯一样，一点儿 也不假。"听到这儿，亚比该失手掉下那块正往嘴里送的火腿，大声嚷
道："先生，可真没料到！难道琼斯先生此刻也在这店里吗？ ""Quare non?，］"巴特里奇说，"这不但是可能的，而且是千真万确的。"
亚比该急忙把饭吃完，就赶到她小姐身边。在下一章里可以读到她们 主仆之间的谈话。
第五章
说明这位可爱的小姐和她那不可爱的女仆是谁
就像六月里偶尔栽到百合丛中的红玫瑰，在一片素淡的白色花朵中间 杂着几点朱红；或者在愉快的五月里，顽皮的牛犊在百花盛开的牧场上散 发着好闻的气味；或者在生气蓬勃的四月里，温柔、痴情的鸽子栖在花枝 上，怀念着它的伴侣，苏菲亚（正是她本人），一手托着可爱的头，倚在 床上，姿容百倍秀丽，气味百倍芬芳，她心地善良而洁白得可以和她的面 庞媲美。正当她一心一意思念着汤米时，女仆跑进屋来，一直奔到她的床 前，大声说："小姐，小姐，您猜这店里还住着谁？”苏菲亚吓了一跳，嚷 道："但愿咱们没给我爹追上。""不是的，这个人抵得过您一百个爹。琼斯 先生本人此刻就住在这家店里。""琼斯先生！"苏菲亚说，"不会的吧。我 的运气哪儿会这么好！"女仆说确实是这样，于是，小姐说一定要马上就见 他，并立刻派女仆去请琼斯来。
昂诺尔大姐刚一离开厨房，老板娘就恶狠狠地骂起她来。这个可怜的 女人确实早就憋了一肚子脏话，这时就像撤掉挡板的烂泥车一样，滔滔不 绝从嘴里倾泻出来。巴特里奇也倾吐了他那份诽谤。他不但痛骂那个女 仆，而且（也许会使读者感到意外）还想糟蹋苏菲亚那玉洁冰清的名 声。“哼，都是一丘之貉，”他嚷道，“Noscitur a socio皿，—点儿也不 假。固然不能否认那个穿得漂亮的小姐更懂些礼貌，不过两个都肯定不是 好货。我敢打保票，一定是巴思来的一对婊子。上流人决不会这么深更半 夜赶路，也不带几个听差。""说得对，"老板娘大声说，"这话说到她们根 儿上啦。没听说上等人住店不叫饭菜的，吃不吃是另外一回事。”
他们正说着，昂诺尔大姐又回到厨房了。她照小姐吩咐的，要老板娘 马上把琼斯先生喊醒，告诉他有一位女客要会他。老板娘叫她去问巴特里 奇，因为巴特里奇是这位少爷的朋友。至于她自己，她向来是不去叫醒男 客的，尤其是上等人。说完之后，她气鼓鼓地走出厨房。于是，昂诺尔就 来求巴特里奇，可是他也不肯去叫。"我的朋友很晚才睡，"他大声说，"这 么早把他吵醒，他一定会生气的。"昂诺尔大姐仍然要他去喊，说她"担保 琼斯先生不但不会生气，要是他晓得喊醒他的缘由，他还会欢喜得要命 呢”。“换个时候他也许会的，”巴特里奇大声说，“可是non omnia possumus omnes[13]。对一个晓事的男人来说，一次一个女人也就够
了。""伙计，你说'一个女人'是什么意思？”昂诺尔大声说。"谁是你的伙 计！"巴特里奇回答说，然后他就直截了当地告诉昂诺尔，琼斯正跟一个野 女人睡觉哪，而且他用的字眼儿实在粗鄙，不便写在这里。昂诺尔大姐十 分生气，骂他是个没规矩的家伙，然后赶忙跑到小姐跟前，把她奔走的经 过和她所听到的消息报告一番。她非常生琼斯的气，就好像巴特里奇的话 全出自琼斯之口，所以不免还夸张了一些。她臭骂了琼斯一顿，劝小姐再 也不要去想念这个根据表现从来就配不上她的人。她重新翻起毛丽-西格里 姆那段往事，对琼斯过去就离开过苏菲亚那件事，作了最恶毒的解释；我 不得不承认，当前这事在不小的程度上也助长了她这样去解释。
昂诺尔大姐滔滔不绝地说个没完，苏菲亚心神慌乱，也顾不得去拦她 了。后来她还是打断昂诺尔说："我决不信这话，一定是什么坏人造他的 谣。你说是从他的朋友那里听来的，可是若有这种事情，朋友决不会给泄 露的。""我估计，"昂诺尔大声说，"那家伙是替他拉皮条的，我从来还没 见过那么难看的恶棍。而且，像琼斯先生这种浪荡哥儿，是不会把这类事 情当作耻辱的。”
老实说，巴特里奇这件事做得有些叫人难以原谅。不过头天晚上的酒 力还没消退，早晨他又喝了一升多葡萄酒，或者说麦酒，因为那梨酒一点 儿也不纯。可是造物在设计他的脑袋时所留作专门盛酒用的部分是很浅 的，一点点酒就会溢出来，把心房的闸门冲开，藏在里面的秘密就会全漏 出来了。而且那闸门确实本来就不牢固。从最好的方面来理解巴特里奇的 性格，他是个心直口快的人。他既然极好问东问西，不断探听人家的私 事，因而也喜欢把自己所晓得的秘密一五一+地全说出来，作为回报。
苏菲亚焦急万分，对刚才的话不知道该不该相信，也不知道下一步该 怎么办。这时苏珊把葡萄乳汁端来了。昂诺尔大姐立刻小声劝她的女主人 问一问这个女茶房，她可能说出真相。苏菲亚同意了，然后就这么打听开 了 ："过来，姑娘，现在我要问你一件事，你只要把实情告诉我，我一定重 重酬劳你。你们店里是不是住着一个年轻绅士，一个漂亮的年轻绅士，他 ――”说到这里，苏菲亚脸红了，感到有些难为情。昂诺尔接下去嚷 道："就是跟这会子在厨房里的那个卤莽家伙一道来的少爷。”苏珊回答 说："有的。""你晓得关于一位夫人的事吗？"苏菲亚接着问下去，"一位夫 人，不必告诉我她漂亮不漂亮；也许不漂亮，可那不是我想晓得的。只告 诉我有没有一位夫人。""唉，小姐，"昂诺尔嚷道，"您可真不是个会问案
的法官。听着，姑娘，刚才提的那位少爷是不是正跟一个婊子睡觉哪？”这 时，苏珊笑了笑，没有做声。"姑娘，回答这个问题，"苏菲亚说，"给你一 个基尼。""一个基尼！小姐，"苏珊大声嚷道，"哈，一个基尼算什么？要 是老板娘晓得的话，她一定马上就会把我辞退的。""再给你一个基尼，"苏 菲亚说，"我答应你一定不让老板娘晓得。”苏珊犹豫了 一下，就接过钱 来，讲出全部事实，最后还说："小姐，要是您真想知道的话，我可以轻轻 溜进他的房间，看看他是不是睡在自己的床上。"于是，她就在苏菲亚请托 之下照办了，并且带回一个否定的答复。
苏菲亚这时浑身颤抖，脸色惨白。昂诺尔大姐劝她把心放宽，不要再 记挂那个下流货。"小姐，您不至于见怪吧，"苏珊说，"请问，您就是苏菲 亚•魏斯顿小姐吗你怎么认得我呀？"苏菲亚说。"那个人，就是这位大 姐提到的那位，他此刻正在厨房里，他昨天晚上提到了您。不过，希望小 姐别生我的气，"苏珊说。"姑娘，我当然不生你的气，"苏菲亚说，"你就 统统告诉我吧，我一定还要酬劳你哪。皿咳，小姐，”苏珊继续说下 去，"那个人昨天晚上在厨房里对我们大家说起苏菲亚•魏斯顿小姐一一我实 在不知道该怎么说下去。"苏珊说到这里，停下了 ；后来经苏菲亚的敦促和 昂诺尔大姐的紧紧追问，她才又说下去："小姐，那人告诉我们，自然，他 说的是一派胡言，说小姐爱那位少爷爱得要命，说少爷是为了甩掉您才去 当兵的。当时我心里就想，这家伙可真没良心。可是现在看到他为了一个 毫不出色的女人（而且还是旁人的老婆），竟然舍弃像您这样一位文雅、 阔气而又漂亮的小姐；说起来这真是一件奇怪的、反常的事哩。”
苏菲亚又给了苏珊一个基尼，对她说，只要她不把这件事传出去，也 不提苏菲亚的名字，她就确实是苏菲亚的朋友。说完之后，就把女茶房打 发走，叫她吩咐驿夫立刻把马备好。
这时，房间里只剩下主仆二人了。苏菲亚就对这位可靠的女仆说，她 心里从来也没有像此刻这么平静过。她说："我相信他不但是个坏蛋，而且 是个下流无耻的东西。旁的什么我都可以不计较，我永远也不能饶恕他这 样野蛮地糟蹋我的名字。这件事使我鄙视他。真的，昂诺尔，我的心平静 了。真的平静啦，我心里非常平静。"说着，两行热泪就连珠般淌下来。
苏菲亚随哭随告诉女仆她心里非常平静。过了一会儿，苏珊回来了， 说马已经备好。这时，一个十分不寻常的念头蓦地冒上我们这位年轻的女
主人公的心头：何不让琼斯先生晓得她到过这家客栈，这样，倘若他对苏 菲亚还有一丝爱情，至少也可以对他的过失给点惩罚。
列位读者请回想一下，在这部历史的进程中，有只小手笼曾不止一次 被荣幸地提到过。自从琼斯先生出走后，这只手笼白天苏菲亚拿它当伴 侣，夜里还带着它同榻而眠。此刻，它正套在她的臂上，于是她气冲冲地 把它扯下来，在一张纸上写上自己的名字，把它别在上边。然后，就买通 苏珊把它放到琼斯先生的空床上；要是他没看到，就由苏珊想法让他第二 天早上看到这只手笼。
苏菲亚付了昂诺尔大姐的饭钱一一账单上还把她本人没吃的那份也开 上了，然后就骑上马，再一次告诉她的旅伴自己心里非常平静，就继续赶 路。

第六章
巴特里奇的机灵，琼斯的狂乱，费兹帕特利的愚蠢及其他
这时已经是清晨五点多了。有些客人起床来到厨房，其中包括军士和 那个车夫。他们两人已经完全和解了，行了奠酒礼，说得通俗些，一道干 了杯。
饮酒的时候，最奇怪的莫如巴特里奇的举止；当军士举杯祝国王乔治 的健康时，他只祝"国王”，而不肯重复"乔治"；因为尽管他是站在和自己 所拥护的相反的这一边而作战，他却坚决不肯向这边祝酒。
琼斯先生此刻已经回到自己的床上（至于他从哪里回来的，就恕不奉 告了），把巴特里奇从正和他谈得畅快的友伴们那里喊来。巴特里奇先说 完一段开场白，接着，在得到琼斯先生的许可之后，又作了如下的劝告：
"先生，这是句老话，可也是句至理名言，就是聪明人有时候也可以从 傻子的劝告里得到益处。我斗胆劝您不如回家乡去，把这horrida bellaM,把这血腥的战争留给那些甘愿吃炮弹的人吧，因为反正他们也没 有旁的可吃。现在人人都晓得您家里什么也不缺，既然这样，何必还这么 到处流浪？ ”
"巴特里奇，"琼斯大声嚷道，"你的确是个胆小鬼，所以，你自己回家 去吧，不要再来跟我啰嗦。”
"请您原谅我，先生，"巴特里奇叫道，"我刚才说的话，更主要是为您 设想。至于我自己，上天晓得我已经够倒霉的了。我不但不怕什么，而且 手枪、大口径短枪或旁的武器在我眼里都和孩子们玩的纸枪纸炮完全一个 样。人反正迟早总是一死，何必在乎怎么死法儿！而且说不定我缺一只胳 膊或是断一条腿，命还能保住呢。先生，请您相信，我从来也没有像今天 这么天不怕地不怕过。要是您拿定主意还是投军去，我也决心跟随您。不 过要是那样，我想给您出个主意。像您这样一位高贵的绅士，这么徒步走 可真太不像话啦。此刻马厩里有两三匹好马，要是您骑用的话，店东一定 可以放心的；万一他不肯交给您，我也有法子把它们弄到手。就是出了乱 子，国王也一定会宽赦您的，因为您此去是为国王的事业而战呀。”
巴特里奇的诚实和他的理解力不相上下，这二者都专用在小事情上。 倘若不是觉得绝对安全，这类坏事儿他是决不会想到去干的。他这种人对 绞刑架看得比事物的适当性更为重要。不过他认为就是偷了马，实际上也
不会惹很大乱子。一方面，他相信只要一提奥尔华绥先生的名字，就足以 叫店东不敢声张；同时，事情不论成败，都没什么风险。他估计琼斯先生 必然有的是朋友，而他自己的那些朋友也一定会来营救的。
当琼斯先生发觉巴特里奇是认真提议要那么干的时候，就声色俱厉地 责备了他。理发师只好竭力把他刚才说的话变为笑话，并且把话题转到旁 的上头去。他说他们准是住到一家窑子里了，因为三更半夜他费了好大勤 才把两个婊子拦住，没让她们找琼斯去胡缠。"唷嗬!"他说，"不管我怎么 拦，我相信她们还是钻进来了。瞧，地上这只手笼正是她们当中一个丢下 的。"琼斯摸着黑回到自己的床上来的时候，确实没看到被子上放着只手 笼，他往床上跳的当儿，手笼又滚到地上去了。这时，巴特里奇把它拾起 来，正想往自己衣袋里塞的时候，琼斯吩咐拿给他看看。这只手笼十分别 致，上边就是没附带什么说明，我们的主人公大概也可以认得出来的。可 是不需要劳动他的记忆力，因为他一眼就看见上面别着的那张纸，上面写 着"苏菲亚•魏斯顿"。这时，他神色惶恐，焦急地嚷着："天哪，这只手笼怎 么会到这儿来啦这我也不知道，"巴特里奇大声说，"不过我曾看见那 两个女人当中的一个，膀子上套着它；要不是我拦住，她们就会和您去纠 缠了。""她们在哪儿？”琼斯跳下床，抓起衣服，大声问。"此刻我看一定 走出好几哩了，"巴特里奇说。琼斯又问了问，终于完全肯定戴这手笼的不 是旁人，正是他那可爱的苏菲亚。
这时候，琼斯的举动、思想，他的神情、话语和动作都不是笔墨所能 形容的。他恶狠狠地骂了巴特里奇一阵，也同样骂了自己一顿，才吩咐这 个吓晕了头的可怜的家伙赶快下楼去雇马，什么价钱也成。几分钟之内自 己胡乱穿上衣服，马上跑下楼去办理雇马的事儿。
且不说琼斯来到厨房时候的情景，先得谈谈巴特里奇被他的主人叫去 之后，厨房里发生了些什么事。
军士刚刚率领他的队伍开拔，两位爱尔兰绅士就起床下楼来了。他们 都抱怨客栈里吵闹不停，害得他们几乎一夜也没能阖眼。
读者也许以为那位年轻小姐和她的女仆坐来的马车是自备的，其实， 是从巴思城的金先生那里雇来的回程车。在出租马车这一行业里，属金先 生最有钱，做生意也最老实可靠。读者中间若是有人走这条路，我们竭诚 推荐您坐他的车。说不定就能坐上本书所讲的那辆，赶车的也许正是这位 驿夫。
车上只有两位乘客，赶车的听说麦克拉契兰先生要去巴思，就邀他坐 上这辆车，车费格外低廉。他所以这样做，是因为他从客栈里的马夫那儿 听说麦克拉契兰先生在沃斯特城雇来的马不大乐意跑远路，想回到沃斯特 它的朋友们那里。这匹马与其说是四条腿，还不如说是两条腿的动物。
麦克拉契兰先生立刻同赶车的一口约定了，同时，还劝他的朋友费兹 帕特利也搭这辆车，凑成四个人。费兹帕特利骑马骑得骨头酸痛，坐车自 然要舒服多了。既然准定可以在巴思见到他的妻子，他认为稍微耽搁一些 也无关紧要。
两人之间，麦克拉契兰要精明得多。一听说这位小姐是从彻斯特来 的，又从马夫那儿听到一些旁的情况，于是认为她可能就是这位朋友的妻 子。他马上把自己这种怀疑对费兹帕特利本人讲了。费兹帕特利压根儿没 有想到过这一点。老实说，费兹帕特利这种人是造物仓促间完成的产物， 忘记在他的脑壳儿里放脑子了。
这种人正像没出息的猎犬，它从来也嗅不出野兽的踪迹；可是当一条 较聪明的狗朝哪边张一下嘴，它也登时照样模仿，而且也不按猎物的体臭 辨辨方向，就拼命笔直往前冲。费兹帕特利先生也是这样。麦克拉契兰先 生刚一说起自己的怀疑，他马上就认为确是如此，立即奔上楼去；还没弄 清楚他的老婆究竟在哪儿，就想给她来个冷不防。他不幸白白地把头撞在 几扇内和几根柱子上。命运总是好跟那些完全听凭它摆布的人开玩笑。它 对作者要客气多了，启发我想到上边那个猎犬的比喻。这时，费兹帕特利 先生的那个可怜的妻子正像只被追赶的野兔。和不幸的小野兔一样，她也 竖起耳朵谛听追逐者的脚步声。一旦听到了，马上就胆战心惊地飞奔而 逃。和野兔一样，到头来她也总是被赶上，遭到粉身碎骨的命运。
然而当前的情况倒不是这样，因为费兹帕特利先生搜索了半天，毫无 所得，只好回到厨房。这时，真好像在猎场似的，呼啦一声（这是猎犬迷 失猎物去向时猎人发出的吆喝），客栈里走进一位乡绅。他刚刚下马，身 边有许多随从簇拥着。
读者，这里也许有必要告诉您一些事情，倘若您早已晓得了的话，那 么您的智慧就超出了我的估计。要告诉您的事，请见下面一章。
第七章
厄普顿客栈里的奇遇到此结束
首先应当告诉读者，刚刚来到客栈的这位绅士不是旁人，正是魏斯顿 乡绅，他此行正是为了追寻女儿苏菲亚。倘若他早来两个钟头，就不但会 找到苏菲亚，还会撞上他的侄女，也就是费兹帕特利先生的妻子。她原是 在贤慧的魏斯顿女士的监护下，五年前，费兹帕特利先生却带着她私奔 了。
费兹帕特利太太和苏菲亚差不多是同时离开客栈的。她被丈夫的声音 吵醒之后，派人把老板娘请来，问明情况，就不惜重资买通了这个好女 人，给她备了几匹马，让她逃走。在这家旅馆里，钱真能通神。尽管要是 老板娘晓得她下面的女仆有这种事，一定会骂她是个贪赃枉法的'|'头，把 她赶掉；然而她自己也并不比那可怜的苏珊廉洁。
魏斯顿先生和他这位侄婿并不认识。即使认得，魏斯顿先生也不会理 睬他的，因为费兹帕特利夫妇是偷着成婚的，因此，在这位可敬的乡绅眼 中就是不合体统的。自从他侄女犯下这个罪过那天起，魏斯顿先生就再也 不理那个不幸的姑娘了（当时她才只有十八岁），把她看作一个怪物，永 远也不许人在他面前提起她的名字。
就在魏斯顿打听他女儿的去向、费兹帕特利同样急着找他老婆，把整 个厨房弄得一团糟的当儿，琼斯走了进来，不幸，手里还拿着苏菲亚的那 只手笼。
看到琼斯，魏斯顿就像猎人看到猎物时那样呼啦了一声，马上跑过 去，抓住琼斯嚷道："公狐狸已经到手啦，那母的一定也不远啦。"讲了好 一阵这类夹七夹八的话，因为许多人同时一齐开口，各讲各的，所以实在 不好记录一一记下来读着也别扭。
琼斯终于从魏斯顿先生手里挣脱出来，又有几个人从中拉架。我们的 主人公说关于苏菲亚小姐的去向，他实在毫不知情。这时，撒波尔牧师走 过来说："你不承认也是白搭。罪证就在你手里握着呢。我可以对天发誓来 证明，你手里拿的那只手笼就是苏菲亚小姐的，因为近来我时常看见她戴 着它。""啊，我女儿的手笼！"乡绅暴跳如雷地嚷了起来。"他拿了我女儿 的手笼？大家来做见证吧，当场抓到了赃。我立刻就把他送到保安官那里 去。快说，你这恶棍，我女儿在哪儿呢先生，请您先别生气，"琼斯
说，"我承认这手笼确实是小姐的东西，可是我用人格担保，我真的一直也 没见着她。"听到这话，魏斯顿更加暴躁了，气得连话都说不清楚了。
费兹帕特利已经从有些仆人那里晓得乡绅是谁了。这位爱尔兰人就想 借此替叔丈效效劳，说不定会邀得他的恩宠。于是，他走到琼斯跟前嚷 道："先生，天理良心，您明明晓得，我亲眼看到您和这位绅士的女儿在一 张床上睡觉，还敢当着我面说根本没看见她，这未免太不害臊了。"说完之 后，他转身过来向魏斯顿表示愿意立刻把他领到他女儿的房间去。这个建 议被接受了，他就陪乡绅、牧师以及旁的一些人登楼径直来到沃特尔太太 的房间。他们也像费兹帕特利先生当初那样破门而入。
那个不幸的女人从梦中醒来，看到床畔站着个宛如刚从疯人院里逃出 的男人，真是惊惧万分。魏斯顿先生满脸惶惑神情。他一看到沃特尔太太 就吓得直往后退，所以不用开口，从他的表情就可以知道眼前并不是他所 要找的人。
女人对名誉的珍惜远甚于身体。尽管这回沃特尔太太的身体似乎受到 更大的威胁，然而由于名誉很稳当，因而她喊得也就没上回那么厉害了。 不过，等人走散之后，她也放弃再入睡的念头。眼下这个住处实在太难令 她满意了，她尽快穿起衣服。
如今魏斯顿着手搜索整个客栈，结果和他惊动可怜的沃特尔太太时一 样，毫无所得。他懊丧地回到厨房，看到琼斯仍旧被他的仆人扣押在那 里。
天虽然还没大明，这阵猛烈的骚乱却把客栈里的人全都吵醒了，其中 有一位神色庄重的绅士，他正是沃斯特郡的保安官。魏斯顿先生一听说他 是保安官，马上就来向他告状。保安官拒绝受理，说这里既没有录事，又 没带法律书，说他不能把如何处理类似诱拐女儿案件的条文都背下来。
这时，费兹帕特利先生又表示愿助一臂之力，告诉大家他曾学过法 律。（他确实在北爱尔兰一家律师事务所里当过三年录事，后来为了想挑 选一种更高雅的职业而向雇主辞了职，来到英格兰。从此，他就干起那完 全不需要拜师学徒的职业，当上了绅士。正像前边约略提过的，这个职业 他干得很成功。）
费兹帕特利先生说本案与处理诱拐女儿的法律毫不相干。盗窃手笼当 然是一桩重罪，而且当场人赃俱获，罪证确凿。
经这位学问渊博的助手一怂恿，再搭上乡绅殷切的请求，保安官终于 答应就地开庭。他坐到法官的席位上，验视了仍然握在琼斯手里的手笼， 并听取了牧师的宣誓，证明手笼确系魏斯顿先生的所有物之后，就请费兹 帕特利先生写一张拘捕状，他表示愿意签署。
这时，琼斯提出申辩的请求，经过一番周折才勉强得到恩准。他举出 拾到这只手笼的巴特里奇先生作为人证，而且苏珊也供说，是苏菲亚委托 她把手笼送到琼斯先生房间里，然后他才拾到的。
究竟是苏珊生性酷爱公道呢，还是琼斯非凡的仪表打动了她的心，使 她说出真相来，我不便断言。可是经她这么一作证，法官就朝椅子上一 仰，说现在可以清清楚楚地看出被告是无罪的，正像刚才可以看出他是有 罪的一样。牧师也赞成这个看法，说上帝决不允许他帮助把一个无辜的人 关进监牢里去。于是，法官站起来，开释了犯人，宣布退庭。
眼下魏斯顿先生把在场的人统统痛骂了一顿，吩咐立刻备马，继续去 追女儿，尽管费兹帕特利和他认亲戚，刚才又那么向他大献殷勤，可是他 对这位侄婿完全不加理睬。在极度仓促和急躁中，幸而他忘记向琼斯讨回 那只手笼一一我说"幸而"，因为琼斯宁可当场舍掉性命也不会把它交出来 的。
琼斯也是一结清客栈的账，立刻就和他的伙伴巴特里奇起身去追赶可 爱的苏菲亚，如今他已经下定决心，追不到决不罢休。他也没有心思去向 沃特尔太太告别了，甚至一想到她就起反感，因为尽管沃特尔太太不是有 意的，然而琼斯却是由于她而失掉了和苏菲亚欢聚的良机。琼斯发誓此生 对苏菲亚永不变心。
沃特尔太太则搭上那辆开往巴思的马车，一路还有两位爱尔兰绅士和 她结伴而行。承老板娘的厚意，把自己的衣裳借给她穿，而且仅仅收下两 倍于原价的报酬，算是出借的费用。途中，沃特尔太太和费兹帕特利先生 完全和解了。他是个漂亮小伙子，如今妻子不在身边，沃特尔太太就尽量 给他安慰。
琼斯先生在厄普顿客栈的奇遇到此就告结束。直到今天，那里还谈论 着可爱的苏菲亚的容貌和优美的风度，大家称她为萨默塞特郡的天使。
第八章
补叙一段经过
在往下叙述这段历史之前，为了说明苏菲亚和她父亲何以出人意外地 先后来到厄普顿客栈，我们不妨往回看一下。
读者也许还记得，在本书第七卷第九章我们和苏菲亚分手的时候，她 心里正在为忠于爱情还是恪尽孝道这个问题辩论了好半天，像通常一样， 前者占了上风。
在那一章里我们已经告诉大家，这场辩论是她父亲引起的，乡绅跑来 一定要她同意嫁给布利非。按照乡绅的理解，苏菲亚已经完全同意了，因 为她承认"我不应该，也不能拒绝您的任何断然的命令"。
看过女儿后，乡绅对女儿的言听计从非常满意，就去举行晚宴。他生 平爱热闹，遇有什么喜事总要跟大家一起乐乐，于是吩咐厨房里敞开供应 啤酒。这样，还没到晚上+—点，宅里除去魏斯顿女士和可爱的苏菲亚， 个个都已喝得烂醉如泥。
次日大早，乡绅派人去请布利非先生过来，因为尽管乡绅没怎么料到 这位少爷深知苏菲亚对他的憎恶，可是布利非还没得到她的许诺这一点乡 绅是清楚的。他非常急于把这个喜讯传给他，他料想已经许婚的姑娘会亲 口证实这件事的。至于婚礼，男方头天晚上已经决定在后天早晨举行。
客厅里摆好了早餐。布利非先生已经应召来到。乡绅和他妹妹自然也 在那里奉陪。这时，乡绅吩咐去把苏菲亚叫来。
啊，莎士比亚，我要有您那管笔就好啦！啊，贺加斯，我要有您那支 画笔就好啦！那样，我就可以把那个男仆的可怜相描绘出来：他吓得脸色 苍白，目瞪口呆，上牙磕打下牙，舌头不灵，浑身颤抖。正是：
正是这样一个人，这样软弱，这样消沉，
这样忧伤，这样沮丧，这样愁眉苦脸，
夤夜揭开普里阿摩斯的床幔，
待告诉他，特洛伊城已烧毁一半。［以
他走进客厅，大声说："苏菲亚小姐不见啦。”
"不见啦！"乡绅从椅子上跳起来嚷道，"真他妈的岂有此理！我要她的 命。哪儿去了？什么时候，怎样，什么一一不见啦！跑哪儿去啦？"
"咳，哥哥，"魏斯顿女士用地地道道政治家的冷静说，"你总是这么无 缘无故地大发脾气。我想，侄女只不过是到花园里去了。你越来越不讲 理，简直叫人没法再住在你家里了。”
"对，对，"乡绅回答说，他的神志恢复起来犹如刚才丧失得那么突 然，"如果只是像你说的那样，那倒也没什么。可是那家伙说她不见了，着 实吓了我一跳。"说完他就吩咐仆人去花园摇铃，自己泰然地坐了下来。
像乡绅兄妹两人这样在一切问题上看法大多相反的实不多见。尤其在 当前这一点上：哥哥没有什么远见，然而对眼前的事却一露苗头就能察 觉；妹妹则总是高瞻远瞩，可是对眼前的事感觉并不敏锐。这两种情况读 者想必都留意到一些事例。其实，他们二人各走极端：妹妹往往预见到未 来根本不会发生的事，而哥哥则常把眼前的事夸大得超出实际。
不过在目前这件事上，他并没夸大。花园里传来的消息和寝室一个 样：苏菲亚小姐不见啦。
乡绅这时亲自去喊苏菲亚，声音正像赫剌克勒斯喊海拉斯也时那样粗大 响亮。正如诗人告诉我们的，整个海滩上都回响着那个美少年的名字，乡 绅的家宅、花园以及左近的田野里，到处也只听到苏菲亚的名字，男人用 沙哑的低音，女人用尖细的嗓音呼喊着。回声似乎也非常乐于重复这个可 爱的名字，因而我相信奥维德是把她的性别弄错了。
宅里乱哄哄地闹了好半天，终于乡绅喊得没了气力，才回到客厅来， 望到魏斯顿女士和布利非先生，就带着一脸懊丧神情倒在一把大椅子上。
这时，魏斯顿女士讲了这样一段话来安慰他：
"哥哥，对已经发生的这件事，我十分难过。侄女真不该做出这样有辱 家内的事。不过这完全是你招来的，怪不得旁人，只有怪你自己。你明明 总是直接违反我建议的办法来教育她，如今你看到后果了吧！我不是上千 次地跟你争辩说，不能让侄女太任性了。可是你向来不肯听我的话。当我 费尽心血来消除她的倔强顽固，矫正你的错误办法时，你又把她从我手里 接了过来，所以对她的行为我不负任何责任。要是你把她完全交给我教 育，像今天这种事就根本不会发生。你只好安慰自己说，这完全是自作自 受。老实说，凭你那种纵容勤儿，还能得出什么好结果？"
"妹妹，你胡说八道！"乡绅回答说，"你真可以把人气疯了。我哪天放 纵过她？我哪天让她任性过？昨天晚上我还威胁她说，她要是不依我的 话，我就要关她一辈子，只给她面包和白水。你这种话连约伯叱听了也会发 急的。”
"谁听见过这种瞎话？”她回嘴说，"哥哥，我要不是有五十个约伯那么 多的耐性，也就早给你逼得什么规矩体统都不顾啦。你干吗总要插一手？ 难道我不曾请求你，央告你把整个事情交给我一个人办吗？你错走一步， 就毁了全部战局。任何头脑清楚的人会那样去威胁他的女儿吗？我不知对 你说过多少遍，你决不能把英国女人当作西拉西亚也的女奴看待，我们有社 会的保护。你只能用温和的手段来争取我们，决不能靠威胁、恫吓和鞭打 来使我们屈服。谢天谢地，亏了《舍拉法典》也在咱们英国行不通。哥哥， 你那股暴躁勤儿，除了我什么女人也忍受不了。侄女吓得采取这个步骤， 我一点儿也不奇怪。老实说，走遍天下，大家谁都会认为侄女这样做是有 道理的。我再说一遍，哥哥，你只好记住，事情完全怪你一人。我劝了你 多少遍……"这时，魏斯顿慌忙站了起来，咒骂两三声就跑出客厅去了。
乡绅走后，他妹妹用比他在场时更刻薄的措词（如果可能的话）来责 难他。她请布利非先生评评谁是谁非。布利非先生非常殷勤地对她所说的 一切表示完全赞许，只是替魏斯顿先生开脱了一切过失。他说："我们必须 把这种过失看作父亲对女儿的溺爱，应当称之为一种可爱的弱点。""那就 更不可恕了，”魏斯顿女士说，"因为他这种溺爱毁的正是他亲生的女 儿。"对这一点布利非马上表示了赞许。
接着，她对布利非先生表示十分不安。他来结亲，对魏斯顿家本是莫 大的荣幸，如今竟然受到这种冷遇。在这件事上，她严厉责备了自己侄女 的愚蠢无知，最后还是把一切过错全推到她哥哥身上，认为在没得到女儿 的同意之前就把亲事进行到这步田地，实在是不可原谅的。她说："不过他 的脾气一向就是那么急躁、固执，我白白对他费了那么多唇舌，真冤枉透 了。”
他们照这样还交谈了好一阵，如果记录下来读者也未必很感兴趣。然 后布利非先生就告辞回家了。扑了一场空，他心里不免有些惆怅。不过他 从斯奎尔那里学来的哲学和屠瓦孔灌输给他的宗教以及旁的一些东西使他 比世上的痴情人更能承担这份痛苦。
第九章
苏菲亚的出逃
现在我们该来看看苏菲亚如何了。倘若读者有我一半那么爱她的话， 就一定会高兴她已逃出了那位十分激动的父亲和那位毫不激动的情人的掌 ，口。
报时器在金属的钟里铿然敲打了十二下，把幽灵唤起，开始巡夜。简 单说来，这是午夜十二点，正如前边说过的，除了正在聚精会神地读着一 本政治小册子的魏斯顿女士，以及我们的女主人公，这一家酒后都已昏然 入睡。这时，她悄悄下了楼，拔下门闩，开了锁，疾步向约定的地点走 去。
尽管太太小姐们常在一些细小的事情上施展出巧妙手法来表现她们的 胆怯（正像男人想尽办法掩饰自己的胆怯一样），一定程度上的果敢对女 人不仅是相宜的，而且在完成她们的天职时往往也是必要的。其实，损害 女性特点的不是果敢，而是凶狠。凡是读过那理应受到人人赞美的艾丽亚也 的故事的人，谁能对她的温柔、善良和果敢不抱同样敬佩的心情呢？同 时，许多瞥见一只老鼠就尖声叫喊的女人说不定能下手毒杀自己的丈夫； 或者更加可怕，能逼得丈夫自行服毒。
一个女人所能有的温柔，苏菲亚都有了，然而她也具备了应有的果 敢。因此，当她来到约定的地点，看到的不是她的女仆，而是一个骑着马 朝她走来的男人时，她并没叫喊，也没晕倒：当然，脉搏跳得总要比平时 快些，因为开头她是有些惊惧的，然而只一刹那就镇定了下来。那人脱下 帽子，毕恭毕敬地问她说："您可是来会另外一位小姐的？ ”接着就告诉 她，正是那位小姐派他来引路的。
苏菲亚对那人的话不可能有什么怀疑，就毅然骑在他身后边。那人把 她平平安安地送到距此约五哩的一座小镇上。在那里，她如愿以偿地找到 了她的好昂诺尔大姐。这位女仆的心完全贯注在她自己的衣服上头，不亲 自看守着，她是放心不下的。因此，她才亲自留守，给了上述那个汉子一 切该有的指示，派他去接小姐。
这时，主仆二人商量起如何走才不至于给魏斯顿先生追着：她们知道 几小时以后他就会派人来追的。通往伦敦的大道对昂诺尔有很大的吸引 力，她很想照直走去，认为既然第二天早晨八九点钟以前家里不可能发现
苏菲亚已经出逃，即使追赶的人明明晓得她走哪条路，也无法赶上。可是 这件事对苏菲亚关系太大了，她不能去冒任何风险；同时，在这场胜负完 全取决于走得快慢的竞赛中，她也不敢过分信任自己文弱的肢体。所以她 决定还是抄乡间小路，至少也走上二三十哩再上直通伦敦的大道。于是， 她就雇下了马，言明顺大道走，其实，她打算走的是小道。这样，她和离 家的时候自己骑在他背后的那个向导一同出发，不过这回在他背后的不是 苏菲亚，而是比苏菲亚重得多、也远不及她那么可爱的东西，一只大皮 箱，里面满装着装饰品。俊俏的昂诺尔打算凭借这些征服若干男人之后， 在伦敦城发迹。
她们从那家客栈出来，沿着通向伦敦的大道走了大约两百步，这时苏 菲亚骑着马凑近向导，用比柏拉图的还要甜蜜的声音（尽管柏拉图的嘴据 说是个蜜蜂房）央求他，前面一遇上岔路就走上去布里斯托尔的路。
读者，我这人并不迷信，也不大相信现代的奇迹，所以我不把下面这 件事看作是千真万确的，因为连我自己也难以置信。但是有人把握十足地 告诉我确有其事。为了忠于史家的职责，我不得不在这里交代一笔。据说 向导骑的那匹马迷上了苏菲亚的声音，它突然停下来，再也不肯往前走 了。
也许这确曾发生过，但并不像传说的那么神奇，而是有其自然的来由 的。原来向导右脚跟上有马刺，一路总不停地使用着（他和虎迪布拉斯也一 样，仅仅一只脚上戴马刺）。在和苏菲亚交谈的时候，上着马刺的右脚跟 不再踢了，那匹马很可能因此就停蹄不前，尤其平时它就常常如此。
倘若苏菲亚的声音对马确乎能起作用，对骑在马上的人起的作用却微 乎其微。那向导只悻悻地说：老板吩咐他走大道，要是走旁的路会丢掉饭 碗的。
苏菲亚看出凭她怎样劝说也不生效，就在她的声音之外增添一种不可 抗拒的咒语：俗话说，咒语能叫老马快步向前，不再停留。古人认为雄辩 术具有不可抗拒的力量，今人则认为咒语的力量最不可抗拒。一句话，苏 菲亚答应一定会给他远远超出他所期望的厚酬。
那个小伙子对这个许诺自然不是完全无动于衷，但是他不喜欢人讲话 含糊。诚然他并没听见过这个字眼，然而实际上他所反对的正是含糊。他 说有钱人从来不替穷人着想。前几天他几乎丢掉饭碗，就是因为他替乡绅
奥尔华绥家里的一位先生在乡下带路，而那位先生没有付给他应得的报 酬。
"陪谁？”苏菲亚关切地问。"乡绅奥尔华绥家里的一位少爷，"那小伙 子重复了一遍，"他们大概喊他作乡绅的儿子。""他到哪儿去？走的是哪条 路？”苏菲亚问。"靠近布里斯托尔，离这儿二十哩，"小伙子回答说。"把 我带到那个地方去，"苏菲亚说，"我给你一个基尼，要是不够的话，就再 加你一个。""天理良心，"小伙子说，"这真值两个基尼。请小姐想想我得 冒多大风险。不过，您要是答应给我两个基尼，我就冒冒这个险。当然， 骑着老板的马这么乱转是十分罪过的，唯一可以自慰的是，他最多也只能 赶掉我，而两个基尼多少可以补偿一些。”
价钱讲妥之后，那小伙子就拐到通往布里斯托尔的路上。苏菲亚完全 不顾昂诺尔大姐的劝阻，决心动身去追琼斯。昂诺尔更急于看到的不是琼 斯先生，而是伦敦。昂诺尔并不像她女主人那样对琼斯有好感。照规矩， 搞恋爱时男方总要对女方的仆人在金钱上有所表示，尤其偷偷摸摸的恋 爱，更应如此；这方面，琼斯先生疏忽了。我们认为这并不是出于吝啬， 而是他粗心大意。不过昂诺尔大姐可能还认为是前者。因此她就恨上了琼 斯，一有机会就在小姐面前说他的坏话。十分不幸，此行她去的正是琼斯 所去的那个镇子和客栈，更不幸的是她碰上同一个向导，而得出这个出乎 意料之外的发现。
黎明时分，这一行人来到汉布鲁克村丝。苏菲亚逆着女仆的心愿，派她 去打听一下琼斯先生走的是哪条路，其实，这事向导就可以告诉她们，可 是不晓得为什么，苏菲亚一直也没问他一声。
昂诺尔大姐报告了从客栈老板那里打听来的消息以后，苏菲亚费了很 大周折才租到两匹不怎么出色的马，骑到琼斯养过病的那家客栈；与其说 是由于头部受伤，还不如说是因为不幸遇上了一位外科大夫，他才在那儿 逗留的。
在这儿，昂诺尔又奉命去探听情况。她到客栈老板娘那里刚一形容琼 斯先生的模样，那机灵的女人马上就（用句俗话）闻出味道来了。因此， 苏菲亚走进来的时候，她就不再回答女仆的质询，直接对她的女主人说 道："老天爷，瞧，谁想得到呢？我敢说，你们两位真是天生的一对儿。小 姐，怪不得那位少爷讲起您来没个完呢。他告诉我说，您是天下最完美的 姑娘，他的话果然不假。可怜可怜他吧！当我看到他抱着枕头，管它叫他
心爱的苏菲亚小姐的时候，我真同情他。我曾竭力劝他不要去打仗，我对 他说，除了被杀害之外没有旁的用处，更没有漂亮姑娘疼爱的人多得很 哪。""这位好太太一定是神经失常了，"苏菲亚说。"没有，没有，"老板娘 大声说，"我没有神经失常。难道小姐以为我不晓得吗？您可以相信，他一 古脑儿全告诉我啦。""什么鲁莽的家伙敢对你这样谈论我家的小姐！"昂诺 尔大声说。"不是鲁莽的家伙，"老板娘说，"正是您所打听的那位少爷。他 真是一位俊秀的少爷，从心坎儿上爱着苏菲亚•魏斯顿小姐。""他爱我家的 小姐！ ”昂诺尔嚷道，"婆娘，告诉你吧，他这是癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅 肉！""不，昂诺尔，"苏菲亚打断了她的话，"不要生这位好太太的气，人 家是一番好意。""是呀，真的，我没什么坏心思，"老板娘回答说。这时， 她听到苏菲亚温和的语气，胆子就更大了起来。于是，就滔滔不绝地讲了 很长一段话，因为说得太过冗长无味，就不记在这里了。老板娘的话有的 地方使苏菲亚听了不大顺耳，昂诺尔听了更是气愤。等到只剩下她们主仆 二人的时候，昂诺尔就乘机对小姐说起可怜的琼斯的坏话来了，说他一定 是个非常可鄙的人，准不是真心爱小姐，不然的话他决不会在酒店里拿她 的名字这样胡乱糟蹋。
苏菲亚并没有从这样极其不利的方面来看待琼斯的举止。也许她更乐 于听到琼斯痴情的癫狂（老板娘尽量把每个细节都加以夸张了），对其他 部分也就不那么计较了。老实说，她把这一切全归咎于他情感的丰富，不 能自持，以及他胸襟的坦率。
不过这件事后来被昂诺尔重新提起，并且渲染得十分丑恶，就加深了 苏菲亚对厄普顿镇上那个不幸事件的印象，使她深信确有其事，从而也便 于昂诺尔劝女主人不同琼斯会一面就离去。
老板娘看出苏菲亚打算不吃不喝，备好马就起程，不一会就退了出 去。这时，昂诺尔教训起女主人来了（她确乎很放肆），先长篇大论地提 醒她本来说的是去伦敦，并且一再暗示这样追求一个年轻小伙子是有失体 统的。最后又郑重其事地规劝她说："小姐，您仔细想想眼下您在干些什 么，是往哪里走吧！”
对于一个已经骑马奔波了四十哩（而且是在并不很愉快的季节里）的 小姐进这种规劝，看来似乎颇为愚蠢。可以设想这一切苏菲亚早已仔细考 虑过了，而且也拿定了主意。从昂诺尔大姐的话锋里透露出，她也这么
想。我相信不少读者也抱这种见解，他们早就认为我们的女主人公怀着这 种目的，并且痛斥她为一个轻佻放荡的女人。
然而事实并非如此。近些日子，由于希冀与恐惧、对她父亲的孝心和 敬爱、对布利非的憎恨以及对琼斯的同情和（我们何必不说出实话）爱 情，苏菲亚百感交集，已经给折磨得心慌意乱了。由于她父亲、姑妈和所 有的人，尤其琼斯本人的行径，把她对琼斯的一腔爱情烧成一团火焰。她 的心神混乱得确实不知道自己该做什么，该到哪里去，或者毋宁说是对这 二者的后果也无所谓了。
不过女仆这个谨慎、贤明的劝告也使苏菲亚冷静地想了想，最后她决 定去格洛斯特，从那里直奔伦敦。
但是不幸她在离这个镇子还有几哩的地方，遇到前边提过的那个曾跟 琼斯先生同桌而食的律师。此人和昂诺尔大姐很熟，就站住和她攀谈起 来。当时苏菲亚并没怎么注意，只问了一下他是什么人。
可是到了格洛斯特，听昂诺尔讲起那人更多的情况，晓得他以走路走 得快出名（正如前边交代过的），又记起昂诺尔大姐曾告诉他说，她们正 要去格洛斯特，就担心她父亲会从这人口中追问出她们的去向；倘若由格 洛斯特沿着通往伦敦的大道走，乡绅就一定会追上她们。于是，她又改变 主意了。她租下一个星期的马，另走一条和她原来的计划不同的路。吃点 东西之后，苏菲亚就逆着女仆的心愿和央求，也不听怀特菲尔德太太同样 恳切的劝阻，又启程前行了。这位太太由于有教养，也许还出于好心肠 （因为可怜的小姐显然过于疲惫了），再三要她当晚歇在格洛斯特。
苏菲亚只喝了点茶，在床上躺上约莫两个小时，等马备好了，就毅然 决然地在半夜十一点离开怀特菲尔德太太的这家客栈，直奔沃斯特大道而 来。不到四个钟头，就到达我们前边见到她的那家客栈。
我们特意折回去，把这位女主人公离家以至她来到厄普顿镇的经过详 细补叙之后，下面再用几句话把她父亲也带到同一地方。乡绅从送他女儿 到汉布鲁克村的那个驿夫那里得到追踪的线索，没怎么费事就赶到格洛斯 特，又从那里赶到厄普顿镇。听到人说琼斯先生走的是那条路（用乡绅的 话说，就是巴特里奇沿途留下了强烈的气味），他毫不怀疑苏菲亚走的 （或者照他的说法，跑的）也是那条路。他用的确实是一句很粗鄙的话， 不必写在这里了。只有猎狐的人懂得这句话，不说出来，他们也可以猜得 到的。

第一章
斥批评家
也许有人会认为，在上一卷的序章里，我们对通称作批评家的那帮不 可一世的人物太失礼了。他们一向期待，而且往往也着实受到作家们深深 的恭维。因此，这一章要说明一下我们何以那样对待这威风凛凛的一帮。 说不定我们将用前人从未用过的一种眼光来看他们。
"批评”这个字出自希腊文，意思是判断。不懂原文、只读过英译文的 人谅必以为指的即是法律上的"宣判"，而那往往又被当作"定罪”的同义字 来使用。
我就倾向于这种看法，因为近来绝大多数批评家都是来自律师界。这 些先生中有不少人对坐上威斯敏斯特大厅［1］的席位已经不抱希望了，就坐上 了戏院的长板凳。这里，他们运用起法官的权柄一一无情地论罪。
倘若我们仅仅拿国家这一最重要最尊贵的职位跟这些先生们比，他们 也许会十分满意一一如果我们旨在博取批评家们的欢心，我们也会那么做 的。既然我们打算直言不讳，就必须提醒他们：司法界还有一种低微得多 的职位，与批评家也不无类似之处，这些人不但宣布判决，并且还亲手去 执行。
实际上，还可以从一个非常公道而恰当的角度来看待当代这些批评家 ――把他们看作普通的诽谤者。一个人专门窥伺旁人的私德，除了发现缺 点并到处散播之外，别无所图一一如果这种家伙可以称作他人名誉的败坏 者，那么为什么不可以把那些以同样恶意去阅读的批评家恰如其分地称作 书籍名声的败坏者呢？
罪恶手下再也没有比诽谤更卑鄙的奴才，社会上再也产生不出更可憎 的蠹虫，魔鬼再也邀不到更般配、更受欢迎的座上宾。我担心世人对诽谤 者所怀的憎恨不及诽谤者应受到的一半。对诽谤者如此表示姑息是有罪 的，追究起原因来就更觉可怕。毫无疑问，窃贼比起诽谤者来算不得有 罪，甚至杀人凶犯的罪也远不及诽谤者的重，因为诽谤是比刀更加残酷的 一种凶器，它所造成的创伤是永远无法治疗的。只有一种杀人的方法与我 们这里所谴责的罪恶行为十分相像。那就是下毒药：一切杀人方法中最卑 劣而歹毒的。这是一种最卑鄙、最可怕的报复手段。为了表明这种罪过不 同于其他凶杀行为，我们的法律曾英明地为它规定了格外严厉的惩罚。
诽谤不但造成严重的损害，以及手段卑鄙之外，还有些情况也大大加 剧了它的恶劣性质：诽谤往往不是旁人挑起来的，而且几乎捞不到任何好 处，除非那阴险恶毒的家伙认为给旁人带来毁灭和苦难，自己就获得了报 偿。
莎士比亚曾以崇高的文笔触及这种罪恶。他说：
谁偷了我的钱囊，犹如偷去废物，什么也不值； 它曾属于我，现在属于他，做过千万人的奴隶。 但是谁将我清白的名声盗去， 于己毫无利益， 却害得我一贫如洗。⑵
对这些，好读者想必都是同意的，然而倘若把这种看法应用到书本的 诽谤上，也许就会显得未免过于苛刻了。不过大家要看到，这两种诽谤同 是出于恶毒的动机，而且两者都不能借口说是由于受到了某种诱惑。如果 我们考虑到书就是作家的子女一一他的头脑所孕育出的孩子，那么就不能 说批评家的中伤是微不足道了。
凡是一直听任缪斯［3］停留于处女状态的读者，对于这种父爱是难以充分 理解的。对这种读者，我们只能模仿麦克德夫也那句悲痛的喊叫："啊，你 没有写过书！ ”［5］然而当我提到缪斯怀胎时多么辛劳，分娩时多么痛苦，以 及慈父怎样照护、抚爱自己的宠儿，把他扶养成人，送到大千世界去；只 要是让缪斯经历过这种分娩过程的作家，必然会感到悲戚，也许还会陪我 一道流下眼泪（尤其如果他的宁馨儿已经夭折了）。
而且，天下再也没有比这更不像是纯粹出于本能、更能符合处世之道 的父爱了。这种孩子确实说得上是乃父的财富，不少这种儿女在老父风烛 残年的时候恪尽孝道，使他衣食无缺。因此，诽谤书的人不但会伤害作者 的感情，也严重地损及他的利益，诽谤者的恶毒攻击会使作品不幸短命而 死。
最后，诽谤一本书其实就是诽谤作者本人。既然管一个人叫“私生 子”，就不可能不管他的母亲叫"婊子”；那么说一本书"糟透了”，"荒谬可 怕”，也就必然等于说该书的作者是个大笨蛋一一就道德而言，这个称号也 许比坏蛋略胜一筹，然而从世俗利益来说，损害说不定还会更大一些。
有些读者也许会认为这些看法十分可笑，不过我相信另外也有些读者 必然感觉到并且承认很有道理一一不，他们甚至也许会认为我对待这个问 题不够郑重其事哩。其实，真理何尝不可以面带着笑容来谈。实际上，出 于恶意一一或者甚至出于放肆而去诽谤一本书，至少也是干了一件极其刻 毒的事。我相信一个难缠而粗暴的批评家难免被当作坏人。
因此，在本章底下这一部分，我想说说诽谤者的特点，并在这里指出 我想排斥的那种批评。除了我上面谈到的那些先生们之外，我绝不愿有人 认为我在暗示合格的文学评论家根本就不存在，或者我竭力把那些对学术 界有过巨大贡献的高贵的批评家逐出文学界，诸如古代的亚里士多德、贺 拉斯和朗吉努斯％法国的达西埃和布梭[刀，也许还有我们当中的几位批评 家；这些人当然有合法的权利来执行in foro literario[8]的判决权。
我在旁处已经提到过一个批评家应具备些什么恰当的资格，这里就不 去一一确定了。我想我可以极大胆地排斥那种对自己从来没有读过的作品 所进行的指责。不管这种指责是出自批评家的臆度、猜疑，还是根据旁人 的报告或意见，当然都可以说是诋毁了它所指责的书的名誉。
还有一种批评家也可以算在这个范畴里：他们并不具体指出作品的任 何特殊的缺陷，只用些毁谤的字眼儿来笼统地贬斥全书；诸如"恶劣"，"乏 味"，"无聊的糟粕"等等，他们尤其爱用"粗俗”一一这个词儿只有由批评大 师来使用才相宜。
再者，即便能够有充分根据地指出作品中的一些瑕疵，如果并不属于 最本质的部分，或者作品另外还有突出的优点足以弥补，那么仅仅根据一 些缺陷即对全书下严峻的判词则不像个真正的批评家，倒更像个恶意的诽 谤者了。这就直接违反了贺拉斯的见解：
Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine, non ego paucis
Offendor maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,
Aut humana parum cavit natura [9]
倘若作品大部分写得十分出色， 偶尔一行半行，我不去要求过苛； （佳作中一些小疵出现） 表明作者疏忽，也是习见的缺陷。
――弗兰西斯先生［10］
正像马希尔［以］所说:Aliter non fit, Avite, liber。意思就是:任何书 都只能这样来写。对品格、容貌以及属于人类的一切美质，都必须这样来 评价。像这部花上几千小时写成的历史，倘若只由于某章或某几章引起极 其公正而合理的指责，就否定全书，那就未免过于残酷了。对于一本书的 指责如果正确（也不都是正确的），并不就抹煞了它全部的优点。然而批 评家往往就根据这些指责对作品从严论罪。尤其在剧院里，只因一段表演 不合观众或任何一位批评家的胃口，立刻就必然有人喝倒彩；一场戏受到 非难，就会累及全剧。在这种清规戒律下写作就像遵循暴戾乖张的意旨来 生活一样不可能。要是按照某些批评家和某些基督教徒的见解来下判断， 就没有一个作家可以在现世得救，也没有一个人来世可以得救。
第二章
苏菲亚离开厄普顿以后的遭遇
在本书不得不掉转回头补叙一笔之前，我们正写到苏菲亚和她的女仆 从客栈走出。现在我们就一步一步跟着这位可爱的人儿，暂且丢下她那个 负心郎，让他为自己的噩运（或者倒不如说是恶行）而哀痛去吧。
苏菲亚曾吩咐向导引她走乡间小路。渡过塞文河走出客栈还不到一 哩光景，小姐回头一望，看到几匹马驰骋而来。她吓了一大跳，告诉向导 快马加鞭。
向导立即遵命，他们一行就拼命奔驰。可是他们跑得越快，追得也越 快。后面那几匹马跑得似乎比前边的更快一些，终于赶上了。对可怜的苏 菲亚说来，这真是十分幸运，因为正当她由于惊惧和疲惫已支持不住时， 却听到一个女性以极其柔和而客气的声调向她打招呼。她立刻放了心。苏 菲亚一喘过气来，就十分高兴地以同样谦恭的神态和对方招呼。
赶上苏菲亚并给她带来一场虚惊的原来也是两位女客和一个向导。于 是这两队人马就结伴而行，足足走了三哩，谁也没开腔。这时，我们的女 主人公压住了惧怕的心情（不过她感到很奇怪，走的既不是大路，又一连 拐了几个弯，而对方依然跟踪着她），就用十分殷勤的语调对那位陌生的 太太说，很高兴和她结伴而行。那位女客像个幽灵一般，巴不得有人跟她 讲话，就立刻回答说：她本人更是高兴，她对这一带完全不熟悉，能遇上 —位女伴简直是欣喜若狂，只怕这么并辔齐驱，有些冒昧，请她多多原 谅。她们还交谈了一些客气话。这时，昂诺尔大姐尾随在后，把她原来占 的位置让给这位盛装的生客了。苏菲亚满腹狐疑，不晓得这位太太为什么 仍然跟着她走同一条荒僻的小路；她心里惶惶不安，可是由于恐惧、腼腆 或其他考虑，一直没好意思问问对方。
这位陌生的女客此时遇到一些小小波折，写起来似乎有损本书的尊 严。原来在最后一哩路上，她的软帽给风吹掉不下五次，她又找不到丝带 或手帕把它系住。苏菲亚一听到这种情况，马上就想递给她一块手帕。从 衣兜里掏手帕的当儿，也许一不小心没拉好缰绳，不幸马又踩空了一脚， 打了个前失，就把她从马背上摔了下来。
尽管苏菲亚是头朝下倒栽下来的，幸而她一点也没伤着。造成她跌下 马来的那个原因如今也许倒帮助她避免了狼狈，因为她们走的那条小道+
分窄，路旁又长满树木，透不进多少月光，而这时月亮恰好为一片乌云遮 住，四周几乎是漆黑一片。就像她跌马而没受到损伤一样，在黑暗中，格 外羞涩的苏菲亚的神情也没被发觉。她只略受虚惊又重新坐上马鞍。
天光终于大白了。两位小姐并辔骑过一片草地。这时，两人定睛凝视 着对方，一刹那间都愣住了。两匹马同时停了蹄，两人同时以同样的喜悦 心情嚷了出来，一个喊"苏菲亚”，另一个喊"哈丽特"。
两位小姐为这番意外邂逅而感到的惊讶一定远远超过贤明的读者所体 会的。读者谅必已经料到这位陌生女客不是旁人，正是费兹帕特利太太， 也即是魏斯顿小姐的堂姐。前边已经交代过，在苏菲亚动身后几分钟内， 这位太太也从那家客栈出发，兼程赶来。
这对堂姐妹本来十分亲昵，彼此感情极深，很长一个时期她们曾同住 在姑妈魏斯顿家里。不料如今在这里相逢，那惊喜交集的心情连一半也形 容不出。然后，两人很自然地就问起对方这是前往何处去。
问题是费兹帕特利太太先提出的，问得好像很随便，也很自然，可是 苏菲亚一时却有些张口结舌，回答不出。她只好央求堂姐暂时按捺一下好 奇心，到客栈再向她说个分明。"大概也没多远啦，"她说，"哈丽特，我也 先忍住，不来打听你的事，等会儿咱俩都会大吃一惊的。”
两位女客路上谈的话没什么可记的，两个女仆之间的话就更不值一记 了，她们也相互恭维起来。至于两个向导，一个在前边开路，一个只得殿 后，根本享受不到谈天的乐趣。
他们照这个样子走了好几个钟头，最后走上一条通衢大道。朝右一 拐，就来到一家看来不错的客栈。这里，他们都下了马。可是苏菲亚疲惫 不堪，最后五六哩骑得十分吃力，这时没人扶是下不了马的。替她拉马的 客栈老板当即看出这般光景，表示愿意把她从马鞍上扶下来，她立刻接受 了他的好意。但苏菲亚似乎命中注定了那天非出丑不可，第二次她没逃 掉：老板刚抱住这位小姐，他那双最近患过严重痛风病的脚突然发软，栽 倒在地，但他同时敏捷而殷勤地滚到这位可爱的女客下边，这样一来，只 是他自己擦掉点皮，苏菲亚倒并没碰伤。不过当她爬起来的时候，从大多 数旁观者脸上看到揶揄的嘲笑，使她感到十分狼狈。她猜到大家笑的是什 么。不过，我们不再描述下去了，免得使那些见到一位小姐出丑会发笑的 人纵情取乐。我们从不把这类事情看作滑稽0,也毫不客气地指出，那些为
了寻一阵开心就不惜在这上头大作文章的人必然是太不顾一位年轻貌美的 小姐的体面了。
苏菲亚的体质本来很好，然而身心疲惫之外又加上这番震惊，她几乎 支撑不住了，就由女仆搀扶着，勉勉强强蹒跚地走进客栈。在这里，她一 坐下就吩咐倒一杯水来。可是昂诺尔大姐却给改成葡萄酒。这件事我认为 她做得很对。
听昂诺尔大姐说苏菲亚已经一连两夜没睡觉了，又看到她累得面色苍 白，费兹帕特利太太就再三劝她好好睡一下，养养精神。她还不晓得苏菲 亚这段经过以及她所担心的是什么，不过，即使晓得了，她也会这么劝告 苏菲亚的，因为一眼就看得出她是需要休息的；而沿着乡村小路走出了这 么远，决没有给追上的危险，所以苏菲亚自己也完全放下心来。
女仆也热烈赞成费兹帕特利太太的意见，苏菲亚就欣然接受了这个劝 告。费兹帕特利太太表示愿意陪堂妹一道睡，苏菲亚也很高兴地答应了。
小姐一上床，女仆也马上打算效法。她先对伙伴亚比该也］连声道歉，说 在客栈这种讨厌的地方，把她一个人丢在大厅里，实在对不起。对方不等 她说完就插嘴说，她也正想睡个觉，并且表示如能和她同床而眠，一定感 到十分荣幸。苏菲亚的女仆同意跟她合睡一个床，说感到荣幸的是她自 己。两人恭维客气了一番，然后就像她们的女主人一样睡到一张床上了。
这家客栈的老板有个习惯（其实，干他这一行的人都如此），总喜欢 向所有的车夫、跟班和驿夫等人打听旅客的姓名、拥有多少田产以及庄园 在什么地方。这批客人确实有很多特别的情况，尤其在上午十点钟这样一 个不寻常的奇怪时刻就都睡起觉来，难免会使他感到纳闷。所以向导刚一 走进厨房，他就开始盘问两位小姐的姓名，以及她们是从什么地方来的。 尽管向导把他们所晓得的都照实讲了出来，却远远满足不了他。相反地， 倒更加激起他的好奇心来了。
这位老板在左近一带是以精明机警著称的。在全教区里，大家一致认 为他看事情比谁都看得更深更远，连牧师也不如他。他取得这个声誉与他 的相貌也颇有些关系，因为他总带着一副聪明绝顶、意味深长的神情，特 别是当他叼着烟斗的时候；而他不叼烟斗的时候又是很少的。他的举止也 颇使人们觉得他高明。他的神态即使不算阴郁，也是一本正经的。他很少 开口，而每逢说话声调总是低沉的；句子虽短，却还夹杂着哼、哈、唔、 哦之类的感叹词。这样，尽管他说话时总佐以一些解释性的姿势，诸如摇
头、点头，或者伸出食指来比画，可是讲完之后他总留一些弦外之音，让 听者自去寻味。他甚至时常让大家感到他言犹未尽，还有所保留。仅仅这 后一种情况就足以为他造成高明的印象，因为人是很奇特的，总喜欢去膜 拜他们所不能理解的一切。这是一个了不起的秘密，有几个欺世盗名的大 骗子就完全靠这个秘密来施展他们的骗术的。
这位高明先生此刻把他的妻子拉到一边，问她对刚来到客栈里的女客 有什么想法。"想法？"他妻子说，"我能有什么想法我可有我自己的想 法，"老板说，"两个向导说的话可真奇怪。一个装作是从格洛斯特来的， 另一个却说是从厄普顿来的。两个都说不出他们究竟往哪里去。可是什么 人会从厄普顿穿过乡村小路到这儿来呢？况且又是去伦敦的！一个女仆没 下马之前就问过这是不是去伦敦的大道。把这些情况兜在一起，你猜我查 出她们是谁来了	我对你的发现从来不妄加猜测，这你是知道的，"他妻
子回答说。"你倒是个乖丫头，"他拍了拍妻子的下巴说，"应该承认，在这 类事情上你一向总相信我的见解。那么，你就信我的话吧，听清楚了我的 话，准没错儿，她们一定是叛军的女眷，本来是跟那位年轻的骑士在一道 的，如今为了躲开公爵M的队伍，特地迂回着走。”
"掌柜的，这话可给你说着啦，"妻子说，"她们中间有一位打扮得跟公 主一样华丽；真的，不论从哪方面看，她都是位公主。不过，一想 到……皿你想到什么，就说吧，"老板轻蔑地大声说。"喏，”妻子回答 说，"从她那谦和的样子看来，可不像一位贵妇人。咱们贝蒂替她暖床的时 候，她只喊她'好姑娘亲爱的'和'好宝贝'。贝蒂要替她脱鞋袜，她不让，说 不劳驾啦。”
"那算得了什么！"丈夫说，"难道就因为你看到有些贵妇人对比她们低 微的人傲慢无礼，就认为所有的贵妇人在下人面前一概都是那个样子吗？ 遇到上等人，我想我一眼就会认得出的一一这一点我有把握。她进来的时 候不是要了一杯白水吗？要是换一种人就会要一杯酒，这你是清楚的。她 要不是位上流贵妇人，你就把我当傻子卖掉，而且谁买了我去，还会大大 赔本。现在我再来问你一下，除非在极其特殊的情况下，以她这样身份， 出内能不带个听差吗？""一点儿不错，掌柜的，"妻子大声说，"这类事儿 你当然比我懂，也比大多数人懂。皿我想我是比你们高明一些，”他 说。"这话不假，"妻子说，"那位小可怜儿真让人同情。她往椅子上一坐，
我就禁不住把她当作一个普通人怜惜起来。可是，掌柜的，咱们怎么办
呀？她要真是个女反叛，你大概打算把她交给官府去吧？她是这么温柔、 和蔼，不管她是不是反叛，要是听到这位小姐给绞死或是砍掉脑袋，我一 定忍不住要大哭一场的。""别瞎说，"丈夫说，"不过这倒是件棘手的事， 主意还不大好拿。但愿在她离开店里以前，咱们能得到战事的消息。倘若 骑士占了上风，她也许会因为咱们没去告密而在朝里给讲句好话，那样咱 们可就交大运啦。皿说得有道理，”妻子说，"我满心盼望她能做到这一 点。她真是一个惹人爱的好姑娘。要是她遭到什么不幸，我会十分难过 的。""又来瞎说啦，"老板嚷道，"女人家心肠总是这么软。难道咱们能窝 藏反叛当然不能，"妻子回答说，"至于说到告发她，不管怎样，没人 能怪咱们。换谁也是会这么办的。”
这位足智多谋的老板在乡里间理所当然地享有精干的名声。这时心里 正在琢磨这件事（他对妻子的意见是很少理睬的），忽然消息传来，叛军 摆脱了公爵的堵截，现在已经攻到离伦敦只有一天的路了。过不久，店里 又来了一个雅各宾党也的乡绅。他兴高采烈地握着老板的手说："伙计，这 回是咱们的天下啦。一万名法国健儿已经在萨福克登了陆。老英国也万岁！ 好样的小伙子，一万名法国人！我这就出去说给大家知道。”
这个消息决定了这位精明的客栈老板下一步骤：小姐一起床，他就去 觐见，因为这时他已经证实（用他的说法）这位女客正是珍妮•加美隆夫人

第三章
短短一章，其中却有一轮太阳、一轮月亮、一颗星星和一名天使
当苏菲亚一觉醒来，精神焕发地起床时，太阳早已西沉；因为这正是 昼短夜长的季节。尽管苏菲亚睡的时间不算长，如不是极度疲乏也是办不 到的。在离开厄普顿时她虽然告诉过女仆，也许自己也认为，她心里已+ 分平静，但是她的心灵已有些染上了那种随着发烧而起的烦躁不安的症 候。也许这就是医生通常说的（倘若他们确有所指的话）精神热病。
费兹帕特利太太这时也起了床。她喊来女仆，随后就穿戴停当。她确 实是个十分标致的妇人。如果她不是和苏菲亚，而是和旁的女人在一起， 她原可以称得起一位美人。可是等昂诺尔大姐自动爬起来（苏菲亚无论如 何也不肯把她喊醒的），帮我们的女主人梳妆打扮之后，曾任司晨星的职 守、当过太阳先驱的费兹帕特利太太也落得和晨星一样的下场：一旦太阳 光芒四射，她就黯然失色了。
苏菲亚也许从来没比此刻显得更漂亮。所以我们也不要怪客栈里的女 茶房过分的赞美：她生完火，走下楼的时候，对大家赌咒说：倘若地上有 位天使的话，她就在楼上哪。
苏菲亚告诉她堂姐自己去伦敦的打算，费兹帕特利太太答应陪她一道 去，因为她丈夫一到厄普顿，她就打消了去巴思或是到魏斯顿姑妈那里去 的计划。刚吃完茶，苏菲亚就提议动身。这时皎月当空，她既不怕寒冷， 也不像许多年轻小姐那样害怕在夜晚走路；前边已经交代过，她生来就颇 有些胆量，如今处境濒于绝望，就更无所畏惧了。况且她已经两次趁着月 色赶路，什么事也没发生，这第三遭胆子就越发壮了。
费兹帕特利太太的胆子却要小些。尽管在面临更大的恐怖时她也克服 了小的恐怖：当她丈夫在厄普顿出现后，她不顾深更半夜就从那镇上跑了 出来；可是如今来到一个她认为丈夫不会追到的安全之所，那些说不出名 堂的小恐怖又大肆活跃起来。她再三央求堂妹等第二天早晨再走，不要去 冒夜晚走路的风险。
苏菲亚对人总是过于谦让。如今看出既不能用嘲笑也不能用道理来消 除她堂姐的这种顾虑，最后只好放弃自己的主张。倘若她晓得她父亲已经 赶到厄普顿，这种让步也许就不那么容易做到了。我想她倒并不怎么怕被 琼斯追上。说句老实话，我相信她还巴不得给他追上哩。作者即使把她这
个愿望隐瞒起来，也算不得欺哄读者，因为这是她内心深处的一种隐秘而 又自然的情绪，理性往往也不摸底。
两位年轻女客决定当晚住下不走了，老板娘就来伺候，问她们想吃点 什么。苏菲亚的声调、神态以及谦和的风度使得老板娘欢喜得什么似的。 这位好女人认定自己所伺候的是珍妮•加美隆，老板娘摇身一变就成为一个 忠实的雅各宾党人了；她既然把苏菲亚当作年轻的王位觊觎者的情妇，由 于苏菲亚和蔼可亲，她也衷心祝愿那个王位觊觎者的事业获得成功了。
这时，堂姐妹两个开始相互表示自己的惊异，想了解究竟是什么不寻 常的事情使得她们在此地碰巧意外地遇上了。费兹帕特利太太在得到苏菲 亚的诺言，答应等一下也一定讲述自己的经历之后，就开始谈起她出逃的 经过。读者如果想知道，请看下面的一章。
第四章
费兹帕特利太太的经历
费兹帕特利太太沉吟了一会儿，长叹一声，就这样讲了起来：
"不幸的人回想起往日最幸福的时光，自然要隐隐感到些悲伤。过去欢 乐的回忆会引起一种深切的惆怅，就像怀念起故友一样。这类回忆常会萦 绕脑际，使我们心神不安。
"所以每逢想起咱俩同在魏斯顿姑姑抚育下共度的那段日子（那是我一 生最快活的日子），我就难过。哎！’矜持小姐'和'轻率小姐'怎么一去不复 返了呢！你谅必还记得，咱们总是这样互相称呼的。其实，你叫我'轻率小 姐'叫得很有道理。从那以后，我一直体会这名字对我是多么恰当。亲爱的 苏菲亚，当年你什么事都胜过我，我衷心希望将来在幸福方面你也超过 我。我永远不会忘记那一回我因为在一次舞会上失意而伤心难过的时候你 所给我的明智、慈母般的劝告，尽管那时候你还不到十四岁。啊，我的苏 菲，当时我的境遇该是多么幸福呀！我竟把这么小的失望看成不幸。说实 在的，那还是我头一次遭到的最大的痛苦哪！”
"亲爱的哈丽特，"苏菲亚说，"当时在你看来可是件不得了的大事。所 以你还是放宽了心吧，当前不管你有怎样难过的事，日后也会像那次舞会 一样显得渺小而不值得去计较。”
"唉，亲爱的苏菲亚，"那位太太回答说，"你要是晓得我目前的处境， 你就不会这么说了。如果我的遭遇不能使你叹息，使你洒泪，那么你那善 良的心一定变硬了。想到这里，我真不打算讲下去了，免得使你听了过于 伤心。”这时，费兹帕特利太太住了口，经苏菲亚一再央求，她才又讲下 去：
"尽管你一定听到了不少关于我的婚姻的话，可是传闻很可能有失真的 地方，我就从不幸跟我现在这个丈夫相识说起吧。我们是在巴思遇上的， 那是在你离开姑姑回到你爹家不久之后。
"在那个季节里，巴思来了一些活泼快乐的小伙子，费兹帕特利先生也 是其中的一个。他人长得漂亮、潇洒，对女人十分会献殷勤，穿戴得又格 外讲究。亲爱的堂妹，总之一句话，要是你不幸此刻碰上他的话，我只能 告诉你，他现在一切都跟过去迥乎不同了。他在乡下混的日子太久了，已 经变成一个道地的爱尔兰老粗啦。可是咱们回到本题上来吧。他具备的这
些条件当时抬高了他的身价，尽管那时上等人和平民不相往来，不许他们 参加上流人的集会，可是费兹帕特利先生却有办法参加进来。你不用怎么 请、甚至根本不请他就会来的，想躲开他还不大容易；又仗着他生得俊， 举止文雅，不难取得女眷们的欢心。又由于他动不动就拔出剑来，男人们 都不愿公开招惹他。倘若不是这样，我相信其他男人早就把他赶掉了，因 为严格说来，他决不应该比英格兰绅士更受欢迎。不过男人们好像也并没 有对他表示特殊的好感。也许由于妒忌，他们总在背后骂他。可是他在女 人跟前十分受欢迎，都对他另眼看待。
"咱们姑姑虽不是个贵族，可是她经常出入宫廷，因此，也成为上流社 会的一员。不管你用什么办法挤进上流社会去，只要你挤得进去，那本身 就形成一种资格。尽管当时你年纪还轻，也可以从姑姑身上得到这种印 象：她对有些人随和，对另外一些人则十分矜持，关键就看对方具备这种 条件到什么程度。
"我相信费兹帕特利先生主要就是靠这种资格取得她的欢心的。这方面 他十分顺利，时常单独到她家来做客。对姑姑这种青睐，他也力图报答。 过不久，他对姑姑的态度变得十分亲近。喜欢传播丑闻的一帮人首先盯上 了他们，而好心人就来替他们做媒。至于我嘛，我承认自己当时曾相信他 的用意正像通常所说的，是光明磊落的；也就是说，借婚姻的手段来夺取 一个女人的财产。在我看来，姑姑不论是凭年纪还是相貌，都不会引起男 人的邪念，然而她却很可以引起男人向她求婚的念头。
"从他最初见到我时就特别对我表示敬意这一点，也更加强了我这种看 法。我认为费兹帕特利先生对我表示敬意，是为了尽可能减轻我由于自身 利益而对这门亲事的不满。费兹帕特利先生这一手确乎起了一定的效果。 我对自己拥有的那份财产很知足，而且我看事情一向最不为利害关系所左 右。所以我决不会去竭力反对一个举止使我很高兴的人，尤其由于我独自 受到他的崇敬，而他同时对许多上流妇女却毫无礼貌。
"这已经够使我惬意的了。可是不久他又采取了一种也许更加使我惬意 的态度。他装作十分温柔、十分多情的样子，成天长吁短叹，显得面容憔 悴。偶尔（究竟是出于做作还是出于天性，我不能断言）他也会像往常一 样兴高采烈地欢笑，但那总是在大庭广众之中或是同旁的女人在一起的时 候。甚至在跳土风舞时，如果我不是他的舞伴，他就显得心情沉重，而只 要一接近我，就马上露出难以言说的柔情蜜意。总之，他处处表示对我另
眼看待，除非我是傻子才察觉不出来。况且，况且，况且……""况且这么 一来你更加高兴了，亲爱的哈丽特？ ”苏菲亚嚷道，随后她又叹着气 说："你也用不着害羞，温存体贴总是具有令人难以抗拒的魅力的，而许多 男人专会装出那副样子。""确实是这样，"那个堂姐回答说，"男人尽管在 旁的事情上一窍不通，谈起恋爱来却都像马基雅弗利那样诡计多端。我但 愿没亲自经历一次这种事。唉，这时候正像当初姑姑那样，关于我和费兹 帕特利先生的风言风语多了起来，有些好心的太太甚至毫不客气地断言费 兹帕特利先生是想一箭双雕。
"可是奇怪的是：姑姑从来也没注意到这一点，而且对于从我们的举止 看来已经十分清楚的情势，也毫不起疑心，好像爱情真的使一个老女人瞎 了眼睛。老实说，她们就像饿鬼似的把男人求婚时说的一些甜言蜜语都贪 婪地听了进去，简直顾不得看看同席的人在干些什么。这种情况我看得多 了，我姑姑就更加证明了这一点。尽管她洗完温泉回来，屡次撞见我和费 兹帕特利先生在一起，可是只要他说上三言两语，表示盼她盼得多么焦 急，她的疑心就统统消失了。他还有一套对付她的绝妙办法，就是总把我 当个小孩子看待，当着姑姑的面只喊我作'漂亮的小妞儿'。起初当然使我很 不高兴，可是没多久我就懂得了他的意思，尤其像前边提过的，背着姑姑 他对我就完全是另一副样子了。不过，亏得我看穿了对方的用意，他这种 行径才没使我大伤感情，不过我也没少吃苦头。因为姑姑真认为我是她的 情人（她这么看待他）所称呼的小妞儿，处处把我完全当成娃娃。讲句老 实话，我倒奇怪她怎么没要我再系上引带也］呢。
"最后，我的情人（他确实是的）认为应当以极严肃的态度向我宣示一 个我早就晓得的秘密：他把以前装作用在姑姑身上的爱情全贯注在我身上 了。他用一种十分可怜的语气埋怨姑姑对他的垂青，把因此而不得不耗费 许多时间陪她聊天说成是自己莫大的功绩。我要告诉你什么呢，亲爱的苏 菲亚？我要对你讲老实话。我很喜欢他，也为自己的胜利而高兴。压倒了 姑姑，使我快活。压倒了那么多女人，使我心花怒放。总之，在他第一次 向我吐诉爱情的时候，我恐怕就有些失态一一要是在我们分手之前，我没 那么差不多明确地作了首肯的表示该有多好！
"整个巴思都在大声议论着我一一几乎可以说，对我咆哮着。有些年轻 女人甚至故意装作不认识我，也许并不是由于真正疑心我什么，只是想把 我排挤出去，因为我霸占了她们所钟爱的那个男人。说到这儿，我不能不
感谢纳施丝先生的好意。有一天他把我叫到一旁，对我作了些劝告；倘若我 接受了他的劝告，那我今天就会成为一个幸福的女人啦。他对我说：’孩 子，看到你和那个完全配不上你，并且会毁掉你一生的男人往来得那么亲 昵，我很难过。至于你那个老臭姑姑，倘若不是怕损害到你和可爱的苏菲 亚•魏斯顿（我担保这是他的原话），我衷心愿意那个人把她的全部财产都 霸占了去。我从不对老女人进什么劝告。要是她们打定主意想投奔魔鬼 去，就不可能把她们拉回来，也值不得去拉。可是天真、年轻、漂亮的姑 娘不应遭到那样的厄运，我要把她们从魔爪下拯救出来。因此，亲爱的孩 子，请容许我向你进这个忠告：再也不要让那小子接近你。’他还对我说了 许多旁的话，如今都记不得了。老实说，我当时并没去理睬，因为他说的 话都与我的意愿相左。同时，我也不能相信，如果他真是纳施先生所形容 的那种人，上流女人肯屈尊跟他有什么亲昵往来。
"亲爱的，恐怕我啰啰嗦嗦谈的这些细节使你厌烦了。简短地说，你就 设想我结了婚，设想我同我丈夫跪在姑姑面前，再设想疯人院里一个疯女 人发作起来，那差不多就正符合当时的真实情景了。
"第二天姑姑就离开巴思，一则为了避免看到费兹帕特利先生或我，同 时说不定也是为了避免看到任何人。尽管我听说她事后否认得一干二净， 然而我相信她当时确乎因为情场失意而有些狼狈不堪。那以后，我给她写 了许多封信，但她不曾回我一封。我不得不承认这件事使我很难过，因为 她无意中却是我的一切遭遇的根由：如果费兹帕特利先生不是利用追求她 来打掩护，他永远也找不到充分的机会来赢得我的爱情的。我仍然敢夸口 说，换个情形，像费兹帕特利先生这种男人想来征服我的心，却不是那么 容易的。老实说，如果我完全靠自己的判断力来选择男人，本来不会错到 这步田地的。可是我完全信赖旁人的见解，而且十分糊涂地认为一个到处 受女人欢迎的男人，他的优点是不成问题的。亲爱的苏菲亚，咱们的智力 并不逊于最聪明、最杰出的男子，为什么咱们往往挑上世上最愚蠢的男人 作伴侣和意中人呢？ 一想到多少有见识的女人都被这种浑蛋毁掉，我就感 到无比的愤慨。”说到这里，费兹帕特利太太停了一下，可是苏菲亚没吱 声，她又像下一章所记的那样继续说下去。
第五章
费兹帕特利太太继续讲她的经历
"结婚之后，我们在巴思只住了两个星期，因为同姑姑和解是毫无希望 了，而我当时又没成年，名下的产业分文也不能动用，还要等两年才成［21］。 因此，我的丈夫就决定去爱尔兰。对这件事我竭力反对，坚持婚前他许下 的诺言：不得我的同意，他不能把我带到那里去。其实，我从来也没打算 同意去爱尔兰。我想谁也不会责备我下定这个决心。可是我并没这么告诉 我丈夫，我只央求他再缓上一个月。但是他已经定了行期，并且无论如何 也不肯更改。
"动身的头天晚上，我们正为这事激烈争辩，他突然站起来，匆匆离开 我，说他要到游乐场去一趟。他刚走出房间，我就看到地板上落了一张 纸，想必是他从兜里掏手绢的时候不留心带出来的。我把它拾了起来，原 来是一封信。我就毫不犹豫地打开来看。这封信我读了多少遍，几乎可以 —字不差地背给你听。信里说：
致布赖恩•费兹帕特利先生
先生：
大札敬悉。足下如此言而无信，诚然令人不胜惊异。尊欠已达百五十镑。除一件半毛半 棉的大衣外，尚未见到分文。足下屡次请求延缓，佯言即将与某夫人或某小姐结婚，但鄙人不 能单靠希望或诺言过活，亦不能以此向与我交往之毛呢商抵账。前者足下告我拟娶一小姐或其 姑母，并谓本可立即娶其姑母，因该孀妇之前夫遗有巨额产业，惟足下更属意于小姐，因伊手 中持有现款也。今番请听取拙见：不拘小姐或其姑母，能娶则立即娶之。请恕我如此冒昧进 言，盖吾衷心祝愿足下时来运转也。下信中当寄上约翰•德鲁格特公司之票据，为期两周，务 望准时偿清是幸。
萨姆•考斯戈拉沃谨启
"这就是那封信，一字也不差。亲爱的苏菲，你猜猜我看了这封信作什 么感想？原来他选上侄女是为了她手中的现款呀！要是这句话字字是把尖 刀，我会非常乐意把它们都插进他的胸膛。我不必去细说我当时的狂怒
了。他没回来之前，我差不多已经把眼泪哭干了。不过还有不少汪在我那 肿胀的眼睛里。他颓唐地倒在椅子上，我们两个好半天谁也没吭声。最 后，他用傲慢的口气对我说：’太太，但愿用人已经替你打好行李，明天早 晨六点马车就套好，准备出发了。’经他这么一激，我按捺不住了，就对他 说：’不，先生，请您慢点，有一封信还没打进行李里呢。’我把信往桌上一 摔，然后就用最刻毒的话骂起他来。
"他素来是个最暴躁的人，可是这一回他没发脾气，究竟这是由于理 亏、惭愧还是为了慎重，我不能断言。相反地，他竭力想用顶柔和不过的 手段叫我息怒。他发誓说，信里最叫我恼火的那段话并不是他说的，他也 从没这么写过。他承认曾向那人提过要结婚，并且表示看中的是我本人， 但是他起了许多誓，坚决否认信里所举的理由。他还替自己开脱，说他在 爱尔兰的田产好久没去料理，手边无钱，所以才谈起那些话。他说这些隐 衷他一直不忍让我晓得，也正是为了这事他才死乞白赖地要我跟他回爱尔 兰。然后他又说了许多甜言蜜语，亲抚了我一番，对我表示了强烈的爱。
"有一个情况他虽然没拿来替自己辩白，然而在我听来对他却颇为有 利：就是裁缝信中所提的'前夫遗产'。姑姑是从来没结过婚的，这一点费兹 帕特利先生也十分清楚。因此，我估量那裁缝一定是凭空捏造，或是根据 道听途说信笔乱写的，那句令人作呕的话想必也是捕风捉影。好妹妹，瞧 我有多么糊涂！我不再是审判官，却当起费兹帕特利先生的辩护人了。可 是我何必提信里那段细节或者用那一点来说明我所以宽恕他的理由呢？ 一 句话，他的罪过即使再重上二十倍，而他只需拿出一半他刚才所用的柔情 蜜意，就足以使我宽恕他了。这时，我也不再反对去爱尔兰了。第二天早 晨我们就启程，一个多星期就到了费兹帕特利先生的宅子。
"我晓得你对我们一路上的情况也很好奇，请原谅我不去说了，因为再 走那么一趟实在不愉快，陪我走你也不会愉快的。
"这倒是一所古老的庄园。如果我有过去你也见过的那样的好兴致，我 很可以把它形容一下，逗你大笑一场。这所大房子仿佛曾经是缙绅之家。 地方很宽敞，也并没因为家具的关系而显得狭窄。其实，里头也没什么家 具。一位似乎与这所大房子同样高龄、非常像《孤儿》里沙孟所形容的那 么一个老妪四在门口接待我们，用一种我听不懂的、狼号鬼叫的声音欢迎主 人归来。总之，整个情景是那么暗淡凄凉，使我真是懊丧极了。我丈夫看 到这情形，不但不来宽慰我一下，还说了一些尖酸刻薄的话：’你瞧，太
太，不光是英国有漂亮房子吧！不过，也许你宁愿住在巴思那样脏稀稀的 公寓里哩。’
"亲爱的苏菲，不管处在怎样的境遇里，一个女人只要能有个愉快、好 性子的伴侣来关心她，给她安慰，那该是多么幸福呀！可是我何必去想这 种幸福的境界来加重自己的痛苦呢！我的伴侣不但丝毫没消除我的孤寂苦 闷，反而很快就叫我相信：不论在什么地方，什么景况下，和他在一起是 没有好日子过的。一句话，他阴沉、乖张，也许你从没看过这种人。一个 女人除非在自己的父亲、弟兄或丈夫身上，确实看不到这种标本。你虽然 也有个父亲，但他却不是这样的人。当初，那个阴沉乖张的人在我面前显 得恰好相反，在所有其他人的印象里，他仍然是那个样子。老天爷！ 一个 男人怎么能够在外面，在朋友当中经常保持着假面具，而只把那丑陋的真 面目留在家里呢？亲爱的苏菲，他们在外头竭力控制自己不发脾气，然后 回家来再想法找补。以我丈夫来说，他在朋友面前装得越是快活、高兴、 好性子，那么等他单独和我在一起的时候就准定越是阴阳怪气的，动不动 就耍性子。怎么来形容他的蛮横无理呢？我对他表示的一切温存，他都冷 冷淡淡，无动于衷。亲爱的苏菲，你和大家都认为我偶尔开的一些小玩笑 十分轻快有趣，然而他却看不上眼。当我心情最沉重的时候，他又唱又吹 口哨。当我情绪极其低落、痛苦不堪的时候，他朝我发脾气，咒骂我。他 从来不愿意看到我心情愉快，也并不把这种愉快说成是对他满意的缘故， 然而我的低沉情绪总会激怒他，他认为那是由于我后悔（用他的说法）嫁 给了一个爱尔兰人。
“亲爱的'矜持小姐’（对不起，这个词儿是脱口而出的），你可以设 想，如果一个女人结下一门在世人看来很不相宜的婚事，也就是说，她并 非像真正的妓女一样为了钱财而把自己卖给男方，那她必然会对那个丈夫 有些喜爱，有些感情。你可以设想，这种感情也可能会冷淡下来。但是我 可以肯定地告诉你，轻蔑却可以使它完全消失。这时，我就开始鄙夷起我 丈夫来了。我发现他是一个（我不得不使用这个字眼儿）不折不扣的蠢 才。也许你会奇怪我怎么没有老早就察觉呢？可是女人对她们所钟爱的男 人干的蠢事，自己总会找出一千个借口来替他开脱。同时，你应该晓得， 要透过活泼愉快的举止和高雅的教养来看穿一个傻瓜，那非有极其锐利的 眼光不可。
"一旦我看不起我丈夫了（我不妨向你承认，我很快就这样了），那么 你不难设想，我自然就不喜欢同他在一起了。幸而他也很少来麻烦我，因 为我们的房子现在布置得十分讲究，地窖里藏满了酒，养着大批的马和猎 犬。既然我丈夫这么慷慨好客，邻居们也就纷至沓来。打猎和宴饮占去他 每天大部分光阴，只剩下很少一部分时间来谈话，即是说，耍性子，那才 是留给我的。
"如果我能同样容易地避开所有其他一些讨厌的伴侣，那该有多么幸福 啊。不过，哎，我不断受到那些伴侣的折磨；尤其令我苦恼的是，我看不 出到什么时候才可以摆脱开。那些伴侣就是折磨着我、日夜纠缠着我的各 种思想。就在这种情势下，我经历了一场我没法描绘、你也无从设想的恐 怖。亲爱的，如果能够的话你就摹想一下我遭到的苦难吧：我所鄙夷、憎 恨和唾弃的那个男人使我怀了孕。我是在沙漠上，或者说，在宴乐酗酒声 中，饱尝了分娩的一切痛苦和悲惨（比为自己所爱的男人而经受的最痛苦 的难产还要痛苦十倍）。没有朋友，没有伴侣，没有那种在我们女人分娩 时往往足以减轻，有时甚至大大弥补所受的痛苦的那种安慰。”

第六章
客栈老板的误会害得苏菲亚惊恐万状
费兹帕特利太太正叙述她的经历时，晚餐端上来了，把她的话打断。 苏菲亚感到颇不自在，因为堂姐的不幸遭遇使她很着急。她没有胃口，一 心只想听费兹帕特利太太讲下去。
这时，老板胁下夹着一个盘子在旁伺候，神情和语调毕恭毕敬得真好 像这两位女客是乘着六马高车光临的。
已婚的这位女客对自己的不幸似乎倒没有她堂妹那么感到难过，她吃 得很香，而她堂妹却几乎一口也咽不下去。从脸上的神情来看，苏菲亚也 比她堂姐更显得焦急、悲伤。费兹帕特利太太看到这情景，就劝苏菲亚放 心，说："结局也许比咱们俩估计的要好呢。”
客栈老板认为这回可有个插嘴的机会了，就决定不放弃。"小姐，您吃 不下东西去，我很难受，"他大声说，"这么长时候没吃点什么了，一定会 饿得慌吧。我希望您不要有什么忧虑。这位太太说得好，结局也许会比任 何人预料的都要好。刚才店里来了一位绅士，他带来极好的消息：也许某 些人已经摆脱了另外一些人的堵截，在被追上之前就会打到伦敦。如果能 打到的话，我相信那里一定会有人出来迎驾。”
当人们有所畏惧的时候，往往就会把自己的所见所闻全变成他们所畏 惧的东西。因此，苏菲亚听了上面这段话，立刻就断定她已经被自己的父 亲发现，他正在追来。她惊恐万状，好几分钟都讲不出话来。等她能勉强 讲话的时候，她就请客栈老板把仆人打发出去，然后亲自对他说："先生， 我看您已经晓得我们是什么人了。可是我求您……我相信如果您有副好心 肠的话，一定不会出卖我们。”
"出卖您，小姐，"老板嚷道，"决不！（他一连赌了几个大咒）我宁可 挨千刀万剐，也不会出卖您。我最恨背信弃义的行为了。我！我一辈子没 出卖过谁，当然也更不会从您这样一位可爱的小姐来开头。如果我出卖 您，全世界都要责备我；何况很快您就可以犒赏我。我女人可以替我证 明，您一进店来，我立刻就认出您是谁来了。在我扶您下马之前，我就说 一定是您。我服侍您时所受的那点伤，将终身成为我的光荣。只要救下了 您，那算得了什么！是的，今天早晨还有人想去领一笔酬金，可我脑子里 从没有动过这种念头。我宁可饿死，也决不愿出卖您小姐来领一笔酬金。”
"先生，我答应您，"苏菲亚说，"只要有一天我有能力报答您的话，您 决不会为了待人宽厚而吃亏的。”
"哎，小姐！"老板说，"只要小姐有能力的话！您要做什么都是可以办 到的。我只怕您贵人多忘事，哪里还会记得一个开店的。如果您不会忘记 的话，那么请小姐记住我拒绝了多么大的一笔酬金一一拒绝了 ！也就是 说，要是发给我，我也会拒绝的。这当然也可以叫作拒绝，因为我准可以 领到那笔酬金，而您也就会给关到什么地方去了。但是您千万别冤枉我， 以为我曾经想到过出卖您，就是在听到那消息之前，我也没存过这种念 头。”
"请问，什么消息？”苏菲亚颇为关切地问。
"您小姐还没听到吗？”老板大声说，"这很可能，因为我也是在几分钟 之前才听说的。即使我没听到这个消息，我也决不会出卖您的，否则就让 魔鬼立刻把我抓去。不，要是我出卖您，就……"这时，他一连赌了几个可 怕的咒。最后，苏菲亚打断了他的话，问他说的消息究竟指什么。他刚要 答话的当儿，昂诺尔大姐奔进房来，面色苍白、气喘吁吁地大声说："小 姐，咱们完啦，全糟啦。他们来啦，他们来啦！"几句话把苏菲亚说得凉了 半截。但是费兹帕特利太太问昂诺尔是谁来了。"谁？”昂诺尔说，"自然是 法国人呀！有几十万人登了陆。咱们全得被杀光，被糟蹋了。”
正如一个守财奴在一座坚固的城里有个值二十先令的茅屋；当他在远 处听说有火警时，他为自己的茅屋急得面如死灰，浑身哆嗦。可是后来发 现烧掉的只是城里金碧辉煌的宫殿，他的茅屋却安然无恙，他立刻又有了 精神，为自己的好运道而眉开眼笑。或者再换个说法（我们不大喜欢前一 个比喻），当一个母亲听说她的宝贝儿子淹死了，吓得目瞪口呆，几乎不 省人事。可是当她听说她的小少爷平安无恙，沉入大海的只是胜利号和船 上的一千二百名勇士时，她的神志立刻就恢复过来了。那颗慈母的心，在 另外场合本来会为这可怕的灾难感到无限悲痛，这时却泰然自若地享受着 蓦然间忧去喜来的快慰。苏菲亚当前正是这样：没有人比她更能为国家的 灾难感到深切的悲痛了，然而当她骤然间解除了被父亲追赶上的恐怖时， 立刻乐而忘忧，对法国人来到一事却无动于衷了。她轻轻责备女仆不该这 么吓她一跳，说那还好，亏得来的不是旁人。
"是呀，是呀，"老板笑嘻嘻地说，"小姐懂得国家大事，她知道法国人 是咱们最好的朋友，他们登陆都是为了咱们好。只有他们才能使老英国重
新昌盛起来。我敢说刚才小姐一定以为是公爵来了。我正要向小姐报告这 个消息，陛下（上帝保佑他！）已经摆脱了公爵的堵截，现在正火速向伦 敦进发呢。一万名法国兵已经登陆。准备增援。”
苏菲亚听了这个消息并不高兴，也不喜欢这个报消息的人。不过她仍 然认为客栈老板真晓得她是谁（她决不可能猜到事实真相），所以她一点 儿也不敢露出气恼来。这时，客栈老板撤去台布，就告退了。可是临走的 时候还一再表示希望苏菲亚日后不要忘记他的功劳。
苏菲亚以为自己在客栈里被人认出，心里自是忐忑不安。她还把客栈 老板针对珍妮•加美隆说的一些话拉到自己身上。因此，苏菲亚就派女仆去 探听一下客栈老板怎么晓得她是谁的，是谁出酬金要他去告密。同时，她 又吩咐早晨四点钟就备好马，费兹帕特利太太答应陪她一道走。然后，她 竭力镇定下来，请堂姐继续讲她的经历。
第七章
费兹帕特利太太讲完她的经历
昂诺尔大姐为了执行女主人的命令，就要了一碗潘趣酒，邀客栈老板 和老板娘一道喝喝。这时，费兹帕特利太太就这样继续讲下去了 ：
"驻扎在我们附近一个镇子上的军官大半都和我丈夫熟识。其中有个中 尉是个很不错的人，娶的一位太太性情和谈吐都很讨人喜欢。自从我分娩 后不久和她一见面，我们就成为难分难舍的知己，幸好她也觉得跟我很投 合。
"中尉既不是个酒徒，也不打猎，所以时常和我们在一起。他轻易不和 我丈夫往来。不过，既然经常住在我们家里，他就把这种往来控制在礼貌 上必要的程度。我丈夫屡次对中尉表示不满，因为中尉情愿和我而不愿意 和他在一起。为这件事他大生我的气，多次咒骂了我，说我夺去了他的伙 伴，还说我真该死，毁了世上一个顶出色的汉子，把他变成了无用的废 物。
"亲爱的苏菲亚，倘若你以为我丈夫生我的气，真是因为我夺走了他的 伙伴，你就错了。中尉并不是一个蠢才所喜欢结交的那种朋友。就算我丈 夫喜欢和中尉交往，他也没权利怪我害他失掉了中尉，因为我深深相信中 尉完全是为了和我在一起才到我们家来的。不，小乖，他是为了妒忌，而 且是最卑劣、最恶毒的妒忌，妒忌旁人见解比他高明。中尉丝毫没有足以 引起他吃醋的地方，然而他喜欢同我、不喜欢同我丈夫往来。原来这个下 流货受不住这一点。啊，亲爱的苏菲，你是个通情达理的人。如果你同一 个智力不如你的男人结婚（你多半会的），结婚之前要多考验几次他的脾 气，看他是不是对你甘拜下风。苏菲，答应我一定这么办，将来你会发现 这有多么重要。""我很可能永远也不结婚，"苏菲亚回答说，"至少我不会 嫁给一个婚前我就看出智力上有什么缺陷的男人。我宁可放弃我自己的智 力，也不愿日后看到我丈夫这种情况。""放弃你自己的智力！”费兹帕特利 太太说，"这是胡说，小乖。我相信你决不会这么自暴自弃。要我放弃旁的 任何东西，我也许都可以办得到；这个我可是绝对不放弃的。倘若造物有 意要我们女人在智力上一律向丈夫低头认输，他根本就不会让许多女人的 智力超过男人。有见识的男人也决不会期待我们这样做，刚才谈到的那位 中尉就是个极好的例子。尽管他为人很聪明，可是他总向人承认（而事实
上也确是如此）他的妻子比他更聪明。这也许就是我那专横的丈夫恨那位 太太的一个原因。
"他说，如果要他听老婆摆布，尤其听那么一个丑八怪（她确乎不是个 美人儿，但是十分文雅，很讨人喜欢）摆布，他宁愿世上的女人全都见鬼 去；这是他挂在嘴边上的一句话。他说他很奇怪她身上究竟有什么魅力， 我会那么爱和她在一起。他说：’自从这个女人来到之后，你什么书也不看 了;以前你装作那么喜欢看书，甚至抽不出工夫来回拜一下这一带来访问 过咱们的太太小姐。’我承认这方面我是有些失礼，但是她们一点儿也不比 这儿的村姑强什么；我想凭这一点就足以向你说明我为什么不愿接近她们 了。
"但是我们之间的往来还是继续了整整一年，那也就是中尉在那镇上驻 扎的全部时间。为了维持这种交往，我只好不断地忍受我丈夫上述的那种 责骂。我指的当然是他在家的时候。他时常去都柏林，每次都走上一个 月；还有一回他去伦敦，呆了两个月。我引为莫大幸福的是这种旅行他从 不要我来陪伴。他时常讥笑那些出门还必须把老婆拴在尾巴上（这是他的 说法）的男人，其实，他是借此明明白白向我表示：即使我满心希望陪 他，也是白搭。可是天晓得我从来也没有过这种念头。
"最后，那个朋友走掉了，我又重新过起孤寂的日子，不是苦苦地想心 事，就是借着看书来解闷。这时候，我几乎整天价看书。你猜我在三个月 里看了多少书堂姐，这我可猜不出来，"苏菲亚回答说，"也许看了十 本吧？”"+本！看了五百本，小乖！"对方说，"我读了丹尼尔四的《法国 史》英译本的大部分，普鲁塔克图的《列传》的大部分，还读了《阿塔兰提 斯》竺、蒲伯译的荷马史诗、屈莱顿的戏剧、齐灵沃性和欧诺瓦近公爵夫 人的作品以及洛克的《人类理智论》。
"在这段日子里，我曾给姑姑写了三封十分恳切（我认为也是十分动 人）的信，可是她一封也没回，所以我也就不屑再向她央求下去了。"说到 这里，她停了下来，十分关切地望着苏菲亚说："亲爱的，我从你的眼神里 觉出你在责备我为什么没有向另一个地方呼吁，从那里我一定会得到更好 的反应，可是我疏忽了。""不，亲爱的哈丽特，"苏菲亚回答说，"你这段 经历已替你的任何疏忽做了解释啦。我自己也犯了疏忽之过，可是没有你 那样情有可原。不过，请你还是讲下去吧。尽管我提心吊胆，可还是急于 想知道最后的结果。”
于是，费兹帕特利太太又这样继续讲下去："我丈夫又去了一趟英国， 这次他呆了三个多月。由于这以前我的生活太苦了，所以这一段日子才勉 强忍受下来；像我这样喜欢社交的人本来是不惯于寂寞的，我能勉强安于 这种生活，也只是因为可以躲开我所恨的那些人。尤其使我痛苦的是我那 个小娃娃死了。我并不想装作多么疼爱他（要是换个环境，我自信是会+ 分疼爱他的），然而我已立志要尽一个慈母的责任。也正是由于哺育着这 个娃娃，才减轻了那种最沉重的、可以说是无法摆脱的苦楚。
"我过了差不多十个星期的孤寂生活，除了用人和很少几位客人以外， 我谁也没见到。这期间一位年轻妇女，我丈夫的亲戚，从爱尔兰很远的地 方来看我。她曾经在我们家里住过一个星期，后来我殷切地邀她再来。她 是个很令人喜欢的女人，本来就聪明，又受过良好的教育。对我来说，确 实是一位受欢迎的客人。
"她来了不几天，就看出我精神十分沮丧。不用问，她就晓得原因何在 了。她非常同情我的处境，说尽管我出于礼貌，不肯向我丈夫的亲戚抱怨 他的所作所为，可是大家对情况非常清楚，并且为此深深替我担忧，特别 是她本人。她泛泛地谈了一些这方面的话，我听了，不禁表示赞同。然后 她先劝我听了可不要惊慌，随之又嘱咐我不要泄露出去，终于作为一个重 大机密告诉我说，我丈夫养着一个情妇。
"你一定以为我听了这个消息完全无动于衷。如果是那样，你就大错特 错了。对我丈夫的鄙夷并不曾使我消除对他的愤怒。如今，又勾起旧日的 怨恨来了。难道我们作女人家的就自私自利到这样无耻的地步，以致我们 所鄙夷的东西一旦为旁人占有，也会焦灼不安吗？会不会是那可恶的虚荣 心在作祟，认为这样一来大大损害了我们的面子？苏菲亚，你怎样看？"
"我确实不晓得，"苏菲亚回答说，"我自己对这方面从来没仔细想过。 不过，我觉得那个女人不该把那样的秘密透露给你。”
"可是亲爱的，她这样做是很自然的，"费兹帕特利太太回答说，"等你 的阅历和书本知识跟我一样多，你也就会这样认为了。”
"听你说她那样做是很自然的事，我很难过，"苏菲亚回答说，"我认为 用不着读什么书，也用不着阅历什么就可以断定，那样做是不体面的，也 是十分恶毒的。不，像这样对丈夫讲妻子的过失，或是对妻子讲丈夫的过 失，是很缺乏教养的，就像当面指摘人家短处一样。”
"哦，我丈夫终于回来了，"费兹帕特利太太继续说下去，"如果我对自 己的心情十分清楚的话，这时我比过去更加痛恨他。可是我倒不像以前那 么藐视他了，因为当我们的自尊心或虚荣心受到损伤的时候，最能使我们 鄙夷的心情减弱下来。
"这时，他对我装出一副和往日大不相同的态度。他的举止和婚后头一 个星期+分相似，倘若我对他还有一点点情意，他很可以使它死灰复燃 的。可是尽管憎恨会继鄙夷而来，甚至会占上风，但是我相信爱情决不会 接踵而至。道理就在于：爱情是一种难以遏制的激情，它必须从所爱的对 象那里得到某种满足。一个多情的人一定得爱上什么人，正如一个有眼睛 的人一定得看东西。因此，当一个女人的丈夫不再是她的爱情的对象时， 那么很可能旁的男人就会……喏，亲爱的，要是你的丈夫对你冷淡起 来……一旦你看不起自己的丈夫了……我是说……如果你多情的话……哎 呀！我简直绕糊涂啦。可是正像洛克先生说的，遇到这种抽象问题，就很 容易前言不搭后语。一句话，真相是……一句话，我简直不晓得说些什么 了。不过，正像我刚才说的，我丈夫回来了。他的举止起初使我十分惊 讶。但不久，他就让我明白了他的用意何在，使我恍然大悟。一句话，他 把我的现款全都输净花光了，他自己的田产也已经抵押不出什么来了，就 想卖掉我的一小份田产供他挥霍。然而不得到我的同意他是办不到的。当 时他装出的那套温柔，完全只是为了取得我的同意。
"我斩钉截铁地告诉他说不成。我告诉他，明明白白告诉他说，刚结婚 的时候，即使我拥有整个印度群岛，我也愿意全部交他掌管。我一向遵守 -句名言：一个女人把心交给谁，她就应该把财产交给谁。既然承他厚 意，老早就把心又还给我，我也打定主意要把剩下的一点田产留给自己。
"我不必去描述这几句话和我讲话时候的坚决态度在他身上所激起的愤 怒，也不去说随后我们怎样吵闹起来。你放心，我把他养情妇的事和盘托 出了，说的时候自然还夹杂着不少愤慨和鄙夷的情绪。
"费兹帕特利先生听了似乎大吃一惊，我从未见他那么慌乱过。天晓 得，他一向是昏头昏脑的。可是他并没替自己声辩什么，而采取了另一种 使我同样感到吃惊的办法。他这样做自然是想诿罪于我啦！他假装吃醋 ――也许他生来就好吃醋，如果不是先天带来的，那么就必是魔鬼塞进他 的脑袋里的，因为没有人敢对我的品格说半句闲话。最恶毒的舌头也不敢 讲我有什么不清不白的地方。谢天谢地，我的名誉正像我的生涯，一直是
完璧的。哪个爱造谣的要是敢的话，就叫他出来告发我吧。亲爱的'矜持小 姐'，不管我丈夫多么叫我生气，不管他怎样虐待我，也不管我的爱情受到 多么大的损伤，在这个问题上我是决不叫人家有什么指摘的余地的。可 是，亲爱的，天下竟然就有人用心那么恶毒，舌头那么尖刻，你就是多么 清白也躲不开他们的诽谤。一句无心说出的话，一个偶然的眼色，待人的 态度稍稍亲切一些，或者无意中随便了些，就会被有些人编造、夸大成什 么了不起的事。可是，亲爱的'矜持小姐'，这种诽谤我一概都不看在眼里。 你可以放心，这种流言蜚语我是一分钟也不放在心上的。不，不，放心 吧，这种诽谤中伤不了我。可是我刚才说到哪儿啦？等我想想看。噢，我 对你说我丈夫吃醋了。请问，吃谁的醋？原来正是我前边提的那位中尉。
他得掉过头来，到一年多以前去为他那股没着落的醋勤（如果他真是吃醋 而不是明明假装的话）找到对象，他这样做也不过是为了咒骂我。
"不过我啰啰嗦嗦讲得这么多，一定叫你讨厌了。现在我快点把它结束 了吧。一句话，经过一幕幕不值得再去叙述的情景一一那位亲戚一直站在 我这方面跟他争吵，最后，费兹帕特利先生把她赶了出去。当他发现我软 说硬说都不成，怎样也不肯答应时，他就采取了一个极为凶恶的手段。也 许你以为他必定是揍了我。尽管他差点儿就揍了，但是他一直也没真正打 我。他把我关在我的房间里，不给我笔、墨水、纸和书籍。只派个用人替 我铺床端饭。
"关了一个星期之后，他跑来看我，用塾师或者暴君的口吻（这二者往 往是一回事）问我答应不答应。我毅然对他说：’我宁死也不。’他说：’那 么你就死吧，活该！我决不叫你活着走出这个房间。’
"又关了两个星期。老实说，我几乎坚持不下去了，开始想向他屈服。 这当儿，我丈夫离开了一个短时期；有一天，来了个千载难逢的运道，一 个意想不到的机缘。正当我悲观绝望的时候……这种时候什么都是可以原 谅的……就在这个节骨眼儿上，我接到了……不过，要是说起细节来得一 个钟头。一句话（我就不去啰嗦那细节了），黄金一一这把能打开一切锁 的钥匙，替我开了房门，让我重获自由。
"我马上赶到都柏林，从那里立刻搭船回到英国。我正要去巴思投奔姑 姑，或是你的父亲，或任何肯收容我的亲戚。昨晚上，我正住在那家客栈 里，我丈夫赶了来。你比我先走了几分钟。但是我还运气，总算逃开了 他，并且追上了你。
"亲爱的，我的经历就这样讲完了。对我来说，这确是一个悲剧。不 过，也许我应该向你道歉，因为讲得太枯燥了。”
苏菲亚长叹一声，答道："哈丽特，我真打心里同情你！......可是你还 能指望什么呢？你干吗，干吗要嫁个爱尔兰人？ ”
"哎呀，你责备得可不公道，"她堂姐说，"爱尔兰的男人中间也有和英 国男人一样品德高尚、讲究信义的。不但如此，老实说，具有豪迈气派的 男人在爱尔兰还更普遍一些呢。在那里，我也看到一些好丈夫的典范一一 我相信，这种人在英国是不多见的。你倒是应该问我：既然嫁了个蠢货， 我还能指望什么呢？我可以严肃地告诉你事实的真相：事先我并不晓得他 是个蠢货。""那么你认为凡不是蠢货的男人就不会成为一个坏丈夫吗？ ”苏 菲亚用低沉的、有些异样的声调问道。"那又否定得太普遍啦，"她的堂姐 说，"不过，我相信再也没有比蠢货更有可能成为一个坏丈夫的了。我所认 识的男人，最愚蠢的总是最要不得的丈夫。我敢断言：一个通情达理的男 人轻易不会去虐待理应受到他尊重的妻子。”
第八章
客栈里一场可怕的慌乱，费兹帕特利太太的一位朋友意外光临
这时，苏菲亚在她堂姐的敦促之下，谈了一下本书前面叙述过（不是 此后将要叙述）的那些事，因此，我想这里不再重复，读者一定会见谅 的。
不过我不能不指出一点，那就是，苏菲亚谈的时候从头到尾也没提到 琼斯的名字，简直好像世上没这个人似的。对这件事，作者既不想去说 明，也不去替她找个借口开脱。真的，如果这可以看作一种不诚实的话， 那么同费兹帕特利太太的开诚布公、披肝沥胆比起来，就更加显得难以原 谅了。然而事实确是如此。
苏菲亚快讲完的时候，一阵喧哗声传到她们这个房间来，声音之大， 颇似一群猎狗突然从狗舍里放了出来，其尖细颇似发情时的猫叫，或猫头 鹰，或者更像（因为什么动物能发出类似人的声音？）某座大门四（以油嘴 滑舌而闻名）的广厦里那些美丽的河神（古时称奈伊雅特四，而译成俗语， 就是卖牡蛎的女人）从口中（有时也从鼻孔中）发出的声音。这些女人不 是像古时那样用乳汁、蜂蜜和油来祭奠，而是清早先痛饮一通用杜松或麦 芽酿成的酒；因此，如果有什么人竟敢亵渎神明，贬低她们所卖的又肥又 嫩的弥尔顿牡蛎、鲜美肉厚的鲽鱼、大如龙虾的虾、刚死了没几个小时的 漂亮的板鱼，以及江里海里其他水神打上来交给这些奈伊雅特来兜售的珍 馐海味，那么这些愤怒的奈伊雅特就会扬起非凡的嗓子，把那亵渎了神祇 的可怜虫的耳朵骂聋。
现在楼下一间屋子里突然迸发出来的正是这样一种声音。最初，这种 雷鸣声还只是在远处隆隆作响，过不久就越来越逼近，逐渐传到楼上，终 于进了她们所在的这个房间。抛开这些明比暗喻，干脆说吧，昂诺尔大姐 在楼底下狠狠地骂完，又一路发着脾气，跑到她女主人面前愤慨万分地嚷 道："小姐，您猜是怎么啦！您会料到客栈老板那个坏蛋居然恬不知耻地对 我说，当着我的面胡扯什么您是那个又脏又臭的婊子（他们称作珍妮•加美 隆的），就是跟王位觊觎者到处跑的那个女人。那个满嘴撒谎、放肆无礼 的流氓甚至还一口咬定说小姐本人已经承认了。可是我抓了那个家伙，在 他那张厚脸皮上留下了五条血道子。我说：你这个浑蛋听着，我家小姐可 不曾跟哪个王位觊觎者有什么关系。她是堂堂萨默塞特郡一位门第最高、
家业最大的上流小姐。难道你没听见过那位大财主魏斯顿乡绅吗？这是他 的独女；是他的……他全部巨大财产的继承人。这个贱货竟敢把我家小姐 称作那个苏格兰的臭婊子！我恨不得用盛潘趣酒的碗敲出他的脑髓来。”
这时，苏菲亚的惶恐不安倒是昂诺尔引起的，因为她在气头上把小姐 的底细给泄漏出来了。不过，老板这个误会倒可以解释清楚苏菲亚先前所 误会的那些话，因而她也就稍微放心了。而且前前后后一回想，她不禁笑 了。这可惹恼了昂诺尔。她大声说："小姐，我确实想不出这有什么可笑 的。被这么个无礼的下等流氓称作一个婊子！谁晓得呢，小姐也许还会怪 我不该替您说话哩。正像人们所说的，自告奋勇，反而费力不讨好。可是 说真的，我决不能容忍旁人管我服侍的小姐叫婊子。我也不肯这么乖乖听 着。小姐的品格比得上全英国任何一位小姐。哪个流氓敢哼个'不'字，我就 非抠出他的眼睛不可。我伺候过的小姐，没哪个的品格有丝毫可指摘的地 方。”
Hinc illre lachryma.四明白说来，昂诺尔正像大多数仆人那样敬爱 自己的女主人。可是除此之外，她的自尊心还迫使她去维护她所服侍的小 姐的名誉，因为她认为这是和她本人的名誉密切相关的。她想，要是女主 人的名声高了，她自己的名声自然也就水涨船高。反之，要是主子被贬 低，她势必也跟着跌落下来。
读者，关于这一点，我得停下来告诉你一个故事。有一天，那人尽皆 知的耐尔•格温邕从她作了短时间访问的一家走出来，正要登上马车的时 候，看到街上围着一大群人，她的跟班浑身都是泥污和血迹。当女主人问 他为什么搞成这个样子时，跟班的回禀说："刚才有个无耻的流氓管夫人叫 婊子，我跟他干了一架。""你这傻瓜，"格温夫人说，"你这笨蛋，普天之 下大家都晓得我是婊子。要是这样，你天天都得打架了。皿他们都晓得 吗？”跟班的关上车门之后嘟嚷说，"尽管这样，反正我也不准他们管我叫 婊子的跟班的。”
因此，即使没有旁的缘由，昂诺尔大姐的气恼也是很自然的。何况实 际上还有个使她生气的理由。请读者不要忘记前边那个比喻里讲的情况。 世上确实有些液体，如果浇在我们的情感或火焰上，所产生的效果恰好和 水相反，不是把火熄灭，而是使它烧得更加旺盛起来。潘趣酒这种香味浓 郁的饮料就是其中之一。因此，渊博的柴尼医生㈤曾说，饮潘趣酒就是往喉 咙里灌液体的火。此话颇有道理。
不幸，昂诺尔大姐往自己的喉咙里倒进的这种液体的火太多了，冒的 烟儿钻入脑壳（据说那里正是理智的住所），蒙蔽了她的理智的眼睛。火 焰很容易经肠胃直奔心脏，从而燃起自尊心这把崇高的火。所以尽管刚看 到这个女仆大发脾气时，我们确实有过小题大做之感，了解了全局之后， 也就不觉得什么奇怪了。
苏菲亚和她堂姐竭力去扑灭这股闹得客栈天翻地覆的怒火，最后总算 如愿以偿了，或者把上边那个比喻再推进一步，等那火把语言的燃料（-切责骂的话）烧光，它也就自行熄灭了。
可是尽管楼上恢复了宁静，楼下却依然吵吵嚷嚷。老板娘正为着昂诺 尔大姐那把肉耙子在她丈夫的漂亮面孔上留下的伤痕而怒气冲天，嚷着一 定要报仇雪恨。至于在格斗中受伤最重的那个倒霉的老板，他却心平气 和。也许流血之后他的怒气反而消了，因为交手的对方不但用指甲抓破了 他的面颊，还用拳头揍了他的鼻孔，使他淌出大量的血来。另外一个使他 平息下来的原因是由于他想到自己确实认错了人。不过最能使他哑口无言 的倒还是他发现自己究竟是怎样弄错了的。至于昂诺尔大姐的举动，那只 有更加肯定他原来的见解。但这时一位排场很大的显贵很有把握地告诉他 说，两位女客中间有一位上流小姐，并且和他很熟。
老板就奉了此公之令，来到楼上，禀告两位女客说，楼下有贵人求 见。苏菲亚听了立刻面色苍白，浑身发抖。尽管老板说话鲁莽，读者总会 从来者的彬彬有礼断定他决不是苏菲亚的父亲。但是恐惧心往往会犯保安 官常犯的错误，容易根据种种无足轻重的情节，不仔细研究双方证词就匆 匆作出判决。
因此，与其说为了解除读者的担忧，倒不如说为了满足大家的好奇 心，我们就在这里说明：那是一位爱尔兰贵族在前往伦敦途中，深夜来到 这家客栈了。他正在进餐时，听到上述那阵风暴般的吵闹，并看到了费兹 帕特利太太的女仆。他和那位太太很有交情，经过短短的询问，得知她的 女主人就在楼上。一听到这个消息，他马上就亲自招呼老板，劝他平息下 来，然后派他到楼上去问候，贵族的原话要比老板转达的还要客气一些。
读者也许会感到奇怪，为什么不派那女仆去代为致意呢？说来很可 惜，此刻她已不适合担任这个（或者任何其他）任务了。那朗姆酒（这是 老板替用麦芽酿成的水酒起的名字）乘这个可怜的女人疲惫不堪、她那些 高贵的官能无力抵御时，偷偷对它们进行了可怕的蹂躏。
我们不想去详加描绘这片悲惨景象。不过有一件事我们本愿把它略 去，可是为了坚持我们所宣示过的对历史的忠实，下面还是得提一下。许 多历史家缺乏这种忠实或是懒得去费事（如果不往更坏处想），往往就任 凭读者自去摸索这些细节，有时还害得读者惶惑不解。
这位贵族一走进来，苏菲亚无端感到的恐怖立即消释了。这位贵族不 仅认识费兹帕特利太太，实际上还是她的一位知心朋友。老实说，费兹帕 特利太太就是多亏他的帮助才从丈夫手里逃脱的。这位贵族具有我们在英 雄故事里所看到的那种义胆侠肠，曾搭救过许多被软禁的漂亮女人。他就 像侠客痛恨魔法师的残酷法术那样痛恨天下做丈夫或父亲的经常对他们年 轻貌美的妻女所施加的粗暴专横。不仅如此，老实说，我甚至觉得传奇里 充斥着的魔法师实际上就是当时做丈夫的男人，而婚姻也许就是囚禁美女 的魔堡。
这位贵族在费兹帕特利家的左近有一片田产，他和费兹帕特利太太已 经相识了一些日子。因此，一听说她被软禁起来，他就竭力想法来搭救。 他立刻就把费兹帕特利太太救出来了，可是他并没采取古代英雄的办法硬 攻入城堡，却按照重智不重勇的现代兵法，买通了守卫；金子比铅或钢更 难于抵御。
费兹帕特利太太认为这段经过无足轻重，不需要告诉她的堂妹，所以 当时我们也没向读者讲明。宁可权且让大家以为费兹帕特利太太买通狱卒 的那笔贿金是她拾到的，铸造的，或是用其他不寻常的（甚至是神奇的） 办法弄到的，也不愿打断她的话，讲出这段在她看来不值得一提的经过。
寒暄了几句之后，那位贵族对能在这里见到她不禁表示了些惊讶，说 他本以为她已去巴思了。费兹帕特利太太坦率地告诉他说，由于来了个人 （不必去提那人的姓名），她没去成。"一句话，"她说，"我给我丈夫追上 了。（这件事既然大家都晓得了，我也不必去隐瞒。）我运气不错，居然 用极其惊人的办法逃脱了。如今，我正跟这位小姐（我的一位近亲）到伦 敦去，她也是从一个同我丈夫一样可怕的专制魔王手里逃出来的。”
于是，贵族断定这个"专制魔王"一定也是个丈夫，就对两位女客说了 一番恭维的话，同时也痛骂了一下男人，甚至还从侧面对婚姻制度本身以 及这个制度所授予男人的不公道的权力（他们就以此压制比自己更明智、 卓越的女性）表示了愤慨。最后，他说愿意保护她们，并且让她们坐他那
辆六马高车同行。费兹帕特利太太马上接受了他这番盛意，苏菲亚经她一 劝，也首肯了。
事情既已商妥，贵族就告辞而出，两位女客也回去安歇。费兹帕特利 太太为了给堂妹解闷，就大大称赞那位贵族品格如何高尚，特别强调他多 么笃爱自己的妻子。她说，在上层人士中间，他也许是唯一对妻子始终不 渝的。"亲爱的苏菲，"她补充说，"在有身份的男人当中，这确实是个不多 见的美德。你结婚时可别存这种指望。请相信我这话，要是抱这种指望， 你一定会上当的。”
苏菲亚听了这话，不禁暗自叹了口气。这话大概不会使她做出什么美 妙的梦来的。可是既然她从不向任何人透露她的梦境，读者自然也就不能 期待在这里读到了。
第九章
几段描写晨景的优美文章。一辆驿车。客栈女茶房彬彬有礼。苏菲 亚的豪迈性格。她的慷慨。她从慷慨中所得的报酬。这批旅客启程 并抵达伦敦。几句有益于旅客的话
那些生来创造人生幸福的人，这时正点上蜡烛，开始干他们每天的活 计，听凭那些生来享受人生幸福的人驱使。壮实的老农正在打点和他一道 干活的伙伴一一牛。灵巧的匠人，勤劳的技工，都从他们硬邦邦的床褥上 爬起，俊俏的女仆也动手收拾杯盘狼藉的大厅，而把大厅闹得这么一团糟 的酒徒，这时却在床上翻来覆去，忽睡忽醒地滚着，好像天鹅绒还硬得使 他们无法安眠。
明白说来，时钟刚敲过七下，两位女客就整理停当，预备登程，那位 贵族和他的随从人员也在她们的请求下，做好动身的准备。
当前出现了一个难题，就是贵族乘坐什么。诚然，在把乘客当作行李 一般看待的驿车里，乖巧的车夫可以毫不费事地在四个人的座位上塞进六 个去，他能让肥胖的老板娘和大腹便便的郡长占的地方不比苗条的姑娘或 细如蜡烛的塾师多。这正是肚子的妙处：一经压紧，它就收缩进去，躲到 一个窄逼的角落里。然而这些为了表示其高贵而被称为“绅士马车”的车 厢，虽比较大，这种硬塞的办法却是向来不采用的。
其实，这难题本可以迎刃而解，因为贵族为了那两位女客，豪爽地提 出愿意骑上自己的马。然而费兹帕特利太太却无论如何也不答应。因此， 最后决定由两位亚比该轮流骑贵族的马，并且立即在那匹马上备好了侧 鞍。
客栈里的一切手续都料理清楚，两位女客辞掉她们原来的向导，苏菲 亚还额外赏给老板一笔钱，一半为了扶她下马时受的伤，一半为了他在昂 诺尔的盛怒下所遭受的一切。这时，苏菲亚才发现丢了件东西，不免有些 着急。丢的正是她父亲最后一次和她见面时给她的一张一百镑的钞票，除 了微不足道的一点零钱，这是她目前的全部家当。她到处找，把自己所有 的东西都翻遍了，也没踪影。最后，她相信一定是在那个黑巷子里跌下马 来的时候（前边已经叙述过了）从口袋里滑出去了。她觉得很可能是这 样，因为当时衣袋里有些凌乱，跌下之前她曾费了很大事才掏出手绢来给 费兹帕特利太太系帽子。
不论这类不幸会带来多么大的困难，一个人只要性格坚强，而对身外 之物又淡泊，是不至于垂头丧气的。因此，尽管这笔钱丢的顶不是时候， 苏菲亚还是抑制住自己的焦虑，仍然以平时恬静而愉快的神情回到旅伴中 去。贵族照顾两位女客坐上马车，又请昂诺尔大姐也坐上去。她说了许多 客气话，叫了好多遍"亲爱的大姐"，终于在那位很有教养的亚比该姐妹一 再推让之下，荣幸地先上了马车。倘若不是经苏菲亚多次暗示无效，最后 不得不强迫她去和那位骑马的亚比该换班的话，昂诺尔一定很高兴一路都 坐马车的。
大家坐好之后，马车就向前移动了。车后簇拥着许多仆人，前边由两 位大尉开路。他们本来跟贵族一道坐在车里，可是即使不是为了给两位女 客腾地方，就是遇上远没那么隆重的场合，贵族也会把他们赶下车去的。 现在这样让坐，是绅士气派。可是为了能追随贵族左右，做他的食客，他 们随时都肯给他当跟班的或甚至充当比那更低贱的差使。
客栈老板很满意苏菲亚赏的钱，他并不懊悔自己跌的和被抓的伤痕， 反而觉得很高兴。读者也许想晓得苏菲亚究竟赏了他多少钱，可是我们不 能满足这点好奇心。不管多少，总归抵得过客栈老板的皮肉所受的伤。不 过，他后悔事先不知道这位小姐是这么不看重钱财的。他说："你就是样样 都照双倍开账，结算的时候她也不会计较什么的。”
但是老板娘却不这么想。究竟是不是由于她比皮肉受伤的老板本人更 感到疼痛，我就不去说了。我可以断言的是，对于苏菲亚的慷慨，她远没 有老板那么高兴。她大声说："其实，亲爱的，这位小姐比你想的会花钱。 她准料到了我们不得到点她的好处，是不会善罢甘休的，而法官罚她的款 会比这一点点钱多得多。我奇怪你怎么居然就收下了。""你他妈的总那么 机灵！"老板说，"你以为我就不比你晓得法官要她出的会更多？可是多出 的钱能进咱们的荷包吗？要是咱们当律师的儿子汤姆活着，我自然会把这 个有油水的案子交给他办，他准能发上一笔小财。可是如今咱们亲属里没 —个当律师的，我凭什么替不相干的人去打官司对，对，你自然最清 楚，"老板娘回答说。"我也认为是这样，"老板说，"要是有财可发的话， 我的鼻子比谁都灵。告诉你说，并不是人人用几句好话便能让人拿出钱来 的。记住，并不是人人都能有办法哄得她掏腰包的，你记住我这话。"于 是，那个做妻子的就为丈夫的精明而喝起彩来。夫妻二人就这个问题的一 段短短谈话到此就告结束。
我们也就跟这对贤伉俪分手，去陪伴贵族和那两位女客。他们走得很 快，两天行了九十哩，在第二天傍晚就到了伦敦。一路不曾遇到任何足以 载入这部历史的重大事件。因此，我们这支笔也得兼程前进，务必使本书 不要落到它所描绘的这批旅客后边。好的作家正应该学学眼前这几位明智 的旅客的办法，他们在某处停留的久暂，总以那地方风景如何，有无古迹 名胜为转移。来到伊叔尔、斯陀、威尔顿、伊斯特伯利和方丈公园四的时 候，我们赞叹人力能使得大自然锦上添花，心神为之陶醉，于是，天就显 得短了。有些地方主要以巧妙的人工取胜，有些地方则天然景物与人工雕 饰竞相争取我们的喝彩，另一处地方天然景物又似乎占了上风。这里，大 自然打扮得十分艳丽，而人工部分则穿戴素淡，伴随着宽厚的主人。那 里，大自然把世上一切最精致的宝物全展示出来；而这里，人的智巧所建 造的只有另一世界才能赛过。
能为这样美妙的景色所激动的鉴赏力和想象力，同样也能从远比这些 要平凡的景物中得到乐趣。德汶和多塞特醐的丛林、溪流和草地吸引住聪明 的旅客们的眼睛，使他们放慢了脚步，可是后来在经过巴格沙特国阴郁的荒 原或者由斯托克布里奇座向西伸展的那片愉快的平原时候，就可以加快脚 步，把时间弥补上了。在那一带地方，只有天上的云彩，有时为了怜悯疲 倦的旅客，打开一下它那斑驳陆离的宫殿供人观赏，否则你走上十六哩地 除了一棵树之外，什么也看不到。
那些一心一意只想赚钱的商人、精明的法官、神气十足的医生、穿得 暖暖的牧场主以及许多有钱而愚蠢的公子哥儿却并不这样旅行。不管是穿 过绿茵茵的草地还是寸草不生的荒原，他们的马都是以同样的速度前进， 每小时不多不少四哩半。牲口和它们主人的眼睛全都死死盯着前方，以同 样的态度将注意力贯注在同一个目标上。马鞍上善良的旅客以同样喜悦的 心情观赏着建筑史上的宏伟杰作以及无名的匠人为富庶的纺织城市所建造 的一些漂亮楼房，现在那里的一堆堆砖瓦仿佛是一座座纪念碑，表明那里 曾经有过一堆堆金钱。座
读者，现在我们要赶快去陪伴本书的女主人公了，只好请您运用自己 的智慧，根据上面的道理来研究一下维奥蒂亚四的作家以及和他们恰好相反 的作者。这一点不需我们帮助，您也尽可以办到。因此，这回就请您努把 力吧。尽管遇到艰深难懂的地方，我们总给以必要的帮助，不像有些作家 那样指望读者靠占卜之术来发现原作的意图，然而在仅仅需要读者留心一
下即能领会的地方，我们决不去纵容您偷懒。倘若您以为我们在动手写这 部巨著时打算让您的智慧完全闲歇下来，或者以为有时您不需要花费些脑 筋就能从这部作品中得到愉快和益处，那就大错特错了。
第十章
关于贞操的二三言，并略论怀疑
到达伦敦之后，这一行人暂时就在贵族家里安顿下来。一路上走得很 辛苦，正当他们歇息的时候，贵族吩咐仆人替两位女客另找个下榻的地 方；因为，由于贵族的夫人不在家，费兹帕特利太太无论如何也不肯住在 贵族的府第里。
有些读者也许会认为这位太太对于贞操（如果可以用上这个字眼）未 免瞻前顾后，过于拘谨了。但是我们必须承认她的处境是很微妙的；如果 我们再考虑到人言可畏，就会同意她这样过于拘谨是应该的，值得一切处 在同样境遇中的妇女仿效。只顾形式的贞操，倘若仅仅是做做样子而已， 抽象地讲起来，也许没有不拘形式的真正的贞操可取；然而讲究形式毕竟 还是比不讲究的好。无论如何，大家总会承认这一点：除非在某种极其特 殊的情况下，不管讲究形式还是不讲究形式的贞操，对每个女人都是必要 的。
住所预备好之后，苏菲亚当晚就陪堂姐住下。她从家里出走时，我们 曾提到她打定主意要投奔一位贵夫人。她决定第二天一早就去探听这位夫 人的住址。根据旅途中她在马车里所观察到的情况，她尤其急于搬开。
我们不愿赋予苏菲亚以那种讨厌的多疑的性格，所以几乎不敢让读者 晓得她对费兹帕特利太太的许多想法，眼下她对她确实颇有些狐疑。不 过，由于极下流的人也可能产生这种怀疑，所以在没有向读者就怀疑问题 广泛地交代一两句之前，最好先不要明白说出。
我一向认为怀疑可分为两种。第一种我看是来自内心。从内心观察事 物极为迅速来看，似乎表明它具有某种预感，而当这种怀疑达到登峰造极 的境界时，往往还会自己造出可怀疑的对象，无中生有，常看到一些多于 实际存在的东西。这种洞察力最是犀利，任何罪恶苗头都逃不掉它那鹰隼 般的眼睛。它不但注视着人们的所作所为，并且也留意他们的言语神态。 这种观察既是发自观察者的内心，它也就深及被观察者的内心，在罪恶刚 刚形成胚胎（甚至在它产生之前），就能看得出来。倘能做到万无一失， 这自然是非常值得羡慕的一种能力；可是还没有一个人敢说他具有这样完 好的观察力，而由于这种锐利观察也可能发生错误，许多祸患也就由此而 生，使得纯洁无辜的人遭了殃。因此，我不能不把这种迅速识别罪恶的能
力看作十分恶劣的东西，它本身就是极其有害的恶行。我特别倾向于这种 看法，因为我担心这种观察总是出自一颗坏心（理由已如上述），同时， 我也从不曾见过善良人具有这种能力。这里，我认为可以断言苏菲亚所有 的决不是这种怀疑。
第二种怀疑似乎是出自头脑。四这种能力实际上无非就是看你肉眼所能 看见的东西，然后就你所看到的作出结论。凡有眼睛的人势必要看；看了 之后，凡有头脑的人恐怕又必然会得出结论。这种怀疑之嫉恶如仇，正如 前一种怀疑之不利于清白无辜的人。而我也不能用不友善的眼光来看待 它，虽然人并不总是绝对正确的，有时也会失误。比方说，要是做丈夫的 撞见自己的妻子给专会制造乌龟的年轻、漂亮绅士抱在膝上或搂在怀里， 我就不能怪他从自己所目睹的亲昵推测到更多的情况。我们决不赞成把这 种亲昵说成是无心的玩笑。读者不难举出许多旁的例子。我只再举一个。 尽管照某些人看来这个例子不合乎基督教精神，我却仍然认为这是完全讲 得通的：那就是一个人可能再次做出他已做过的事；当过一次恶棍的人还 可能照样再当一次。老实说，我相信苏菲亚所持的怀疑就属于这一种。基 于这种怀疑，她形成了这样一个看法：堂姐实际上并不像她想的那样好。
事情看来是这样：费兹帕特利太太明智地认为世界上女人的贞操就和 一只可怜的野兔的处境一样，只要它一走出窟来，就必然会遇到敌人，不 可能遇到旁的。所以她在立志乘机摆脱她丈夫的庇护之后，立刻就决心把 自己置于另一男人的庇护之下。谁最适宜做她的保护人呢？当然是那个身 份高，既有资财又有声望的人喽。这人不但具有使男人成为游侠的豪迈性 格，也即是说，专喜搭救落难中的妇女，并且还对她表示过无限爱慕，也 已经尽他所能地证明了这种心地。
不过由于法律愚蠢地忘记规定下一个出逃妇女的代理丈夫或保护人的 职务，而心怀恶意者总是喜欢用更加刻薄的字眼来称呼这种人，所以贵族 就决定只偷偷地执行这一切好心的职务，不公开担任保护者的身份。不仅 如此，为了避免人们以这样身份来看待他，还商定那位太太直接前往巴 思，贵族则先去伦敦，然后遵医嘱再去巴思。
所有这些情况，现在苏菲亚都完全清楚了；她不是从费兹帕特利太太 的嘴里或举止上得知的，而是贵族透露出来的；他的保密本领远远不如这 位好太太。她在自述时对这一点讳莫如深，也许倒更加深了她堂妹心里如 今产生的疑窦。
苏菲亚没怎么费事就找到了她想投奔的那位夫人，因为城里没有一个 轿夫不晓得她的宅子。夫人一收到苏菲亚的信，就殷切地邀她前往，苏菲 亚立刻接受了她的邀请。费兹帕特利太太只不过说了几句客套话，并没认 真留她。至于这是由于她已经察觉出苏菲亚的疑心而有所不快呢，还是有 旁的原因，我不能断言。有一点是可以肯定的：她之急于和苏菲亚分手， 正如苏菲亚之迫切希望离去。
临别的时候，苏菲亚少不得委婉地劝了堂姐几句，央求堂姐要想想自 己的处境多么危险，一定要好自珍重，并且希望她能想法跟堂姐夫和 解。"亲爱的，"她说，"你应该还记得魏斯顿姑姑一再对咱们讲过的那句名 言吧：一旦婚姻联盟破裂了，夫妻之间宣了战，不论在什么条件下，讲和 对女方总是有利的。这是姑姑的原话，而她是饱经世故的。"费兹帕特利太 太轻蔑地笑了笑说："小乖，你不用替我担心，还是多照顾你自己吧，你比 我年纪轻。过几天我就来看你。不过，亲爱的苏菲，我劝你一句话：把 那'矜持小姐'的性子丢在乡下吧，我敢担保，这种性子和城市是格格不入 的。”
堂姊妹俩就此分手。苏菲亚径直到贝拉斯顿夫人府上去，受到极为热 烈而彬彬有礼的欢迎。从前夫人在魏斯顿姑妈家见到苏菲亚时，就很喜欢 她，非常高兴又和她见面。一听苏菲亚谈起离开乡绅投奔伦敦的经过，夫 人就满口称赞她有见识，有毅力。她非常满意苏菲亚对她这么信任，投奔 她府上来避难；并答应一定尽力保护她。
现在我们既然把苏菲亚安置在可靠的人手里，我想读者会同意暂时把 她放一下，先去看看其他人物一一特别是可怜的琼斯。我们丢下他，让他 自己去痛悔前非已经好长时间了，他造的孽本身就是对他的惩罚一一这正 是邪恶行为的特点。

第十二卷
与上一卷同一时期的事
第一章
说明在一个现代作家的作品中，哪些应视为剽窃而来的，哪些属于 合法的战利品
渊博的读者一定会理会到，在这部巨著中，我时常摘译古代一流作家 的文章，而不去援引其原文或者完全不去理会引文的出处。
贤明的班尼尔神父［1］在他那部学识精奥、立论正确的《神话学》的序言 里，曾对这种写作方法提出过一个极其恰当的看法。他说："读者不难注意 到我往往重视他的名声甚于我自己的。一个作家本可以很方便地使用一些 深奥的引句，这样做只需费点抄写的工夫就行了；然而为了读者的缘故， 他宁可克制住，这当然出于作家对其读者很大的敬意。”
把一部作品塞满了这种鸡零狗碎当然可以看作是对读书界一种不折不 扣的欺骗。如果不是在脑海里，至少也在书架上，读者已经整本地有了的 东西，又迫使他们再零零星星地买上第二回。对于没学问的人这就更加残 酷，他们花冤枉钱去买对他们毫无用处的东西。一个作家在他的作品里插 进大量的希腊文和拉丁文的引句，这等于用拍卖商的那种卑鄙手段来对待 男女读者；他们总是把要卖的商品杂七杂八地安排在一起，为了买一件需 要的货色，你必须同时买下一些对你毫无用场的东西。
但是再公正无私的行为也会为愚昧的人所误解，为心怀恶意者所歪 曲，所以有时候我也恨不得为了保全自己的名声而牺牲读者的利益，在我 借用旁人的思想或词句的时候要抄录原文，或者至少也注明原作的章节。 我确实有些担心由于采取了相反的办法，常常使自己陷于不利的地位，有 人可能因为我不曾注明原作者的名字，不免怀疑我有剽窃他人作品之嫌， 而不认为我这样做是出于与那位合情合理地享受盛名的法国人同样的高贵 动机。
为了防止日后遭到任何非难，我在这里先坦率招认这个事实并加以辩 解。我们可以把古代作家看作一片肥沃的公有地，凡是在帕尔纳斯峰有一 席之地的人⑵，都有权在这里任意养肥自己的缪斯。或者说得更明白一些， 今人之于古人，正如穷人之于富人。所谓穷人，这里指的是在英语中通称 作群氓⑶那个人数众多而且可敬的集合体。凡是有幸和他们多少有过些接触 的人，必然十分清楚群氓所共同恪守的一项准则：对阔邻居要毫不犹豫地 去打抢，这既不是什么罪过，也谈不上可耻。这些群氓不断地按照上述这
项准则行事，几乎王国每个教区里都有一帮人结成私党，经常和某个叫作 乡绅的殷实人物作对，所有的穷邻居都把他的财产看作随时可据为己有的 战利品。他们认为这种掠夺根本算不得什么罪过，并且把互相隐瞒庇护、 使大家受不到惩罚看作是信誉上和道德上的义务。
我们这些作家也应该把荷马、维吉尔、贺拉斯、西塞罗等古人看作家 产殷实的乡绅，我们这批帕尔纳斯峰上的穷汉就根据由来已久的惯例，什 么来得顺手就拿什么。我要求这种自由，也打算让我的穷邻居援例享受。 我只申明，并且恳求我的伙伴们一起做到这一点：我们之间一定要坚持群 氓之间的那种绝对的诚实。我们如果相互盗窃，那真是罪大恶极，寡廉鲜 耻;因为那实际上就是欺诈穷人（有时候被欺诈的人也许比我们自己还 穷），或者用最刻薄的说法，等于去抢医院。
因此，经过最严格的检查，我扪心自问，并没犯这种可鄙的盗窃罪， 我却甘愿承认犯了前一种罪过。古代作家的作品中凡是有我可用的东西， 我就毫不踌躇地拿来用，而且也不去注明原作者的姓名和出处。不仅如 此，这类词句一经写到我自己的作品中，就绝对变成我自己的作品了，我 也期望所有的读者把它们完全看作纯粹归我所有。但是只在一个条件下我 才坚持这个权利：我对穷伙伴是绝对诚实的。如果从他们的薄产中有所借 用的话，我一定注明出处，以便随时可以归还原主。
有一位摩尔先生皿就疏忽了这一点，这是十分不应该的。他过去曾经借 用过蒲伯的几行诗，后来又任意把其中六行用到他的剧本《时髦竞赛》中 了。蒲伯先生非常幸运地在该剧中发现了它们，他用强硬手段夺回了自己 的财产，仍然放回到自己的作品中。为了进一步给以惩罚，他把摩尔投入 《愚人记》那座臭气熏天的地牢里。作为诗文市场上对交易不公的一个正 当的惩罚，人们现在仍然记得这件不愉快的事，而且永远也不会忘记。
第二章
乡绅尽管没追到他的女儿，却别有所获，因而他就不再追下去了
现在我们再回到厄普顿的那家客栈去。我们从那里先追踪魏斯顿乡 绅。不久他就将到达旅程的终点，那以后，我们可以有充分的时间来追随 本书的男主人公。
读者大约还记得这位乡绅是在盛怒之下走出客栈的。他就带着满腔怒 火追赶起他的女儿。听马夫说他的女儿渡过赛汶河了，他也率领随从跨过 那条河。他撒开了缰绳拼命地奔驰，一面赌着咒说，一旦追上可怜的苏菲 亚就非狠狠叫她尝点厉害不可。
走了不远就来到一个十字路口。于是他召集了一个短短的军事会议， 听取了种种意见之后，就凭运气作主，直奔沃斯特大道而去。
前进了两哩光景，他极其悲伤地慨叹起来，连声嚷道："太可惜了 ！再 没有比我更倒霉的了 ！"接着就胡乱诅咒痛骂了一通。
这时候，牧师想来宽慰他两句。"先生，您别难过啦，"他说，"不要像 那些没有希望的人一样行事。尽管咱们还没追上小姐，可是运气还不错， 咱们一直没走错路。说不定小姐很快就走累了，在什么客栈里歇着呢，以 便恢复肉体的功能；那样，在精神上来说，您马上就一定可以compos voti[5]了。”
"呸，这个浪货！"乡绅回答说，"我是在可惜这么好的一个打猎的早 晨。在这种季节，特别是在下了霜以后，这么一个最容易追踪猎物的日 子，竟白白地错过了，真叫人受不了。”
命运女神偶尔出于怜悯也会玩一些极其荒唐的把戏的。究竟是命运女 神对乡绅表示同情呢，还是既然决定了不让乡绅追上他的女儿，就有意从 另一方面给他点补偿，我不去断言。可是在他讲完上述那几句话，随着又 咒骂了两三声之后，离他们不远的地方就有一群猎犬放开悦耳的喉咙大叫 起来。乡绅和他胯下的马一听见，马上就都支起了耳朵。乡绅嚷道："她跑 啦，她跑啦！要没跑我不是人！"并立刻踢马前进；其实，这马用不着踢， 它和主人一样急于追赶。这批人马就穿过一片玉蜀黍地，直奔猎犬去处， 一路上吆吆喝喝的。那位可怜的牧师在胸前画个十字，紧紧跟在后面。
神话里说，爱神维纳斯按照多情的恋人的愿望，把葛丽玛勒金从一只 猫变为美女。但她依然保持着猫性，所以一瞥见耗子，就记起往日的狩猎
生涯，从丈夫的床上跳下来去追那只小动物。
这个故事究竟意味着什么呢？那位新娘子并不是不乐意依偎在丈夫温 存的怀抱中。尽管有些人说猫容易绝情绝义，可是在一定场合下，女人和 猫都会高兴得不停地呼噜。事实正如贤明的罗杰•列斯特朗爵士 [6]所发表的 这样一段深刻感想："倘若我们把本性关在大门之外，它仍会从窗口钻进 来。猫虽然变成了太太，它却依然是捉老鼠的行家。"同样地，我们不可责 备乡绅爱女之心不切，因为实际上他是很爱苏菲亚的。我们只要想到他是 一位乡绅，而且又是个猎人，再把那个寓言和那段言之成理的感想运用上 去，就完全可以理解了。
猎犬撒开腿跑去，乡绅越过篱笆，跨过沟渠，像往常那样一路呼啸， 动作敏捷，也像往常那样兴高采烈。他把苏菲亚完全丢在脑后，一点也没 因她而减少打猎的兴致。他说这是他生平看到的最壮观的一次狩猎，赌咒 说，完全值得为它跑上五十哩。既然乡绅忘掉了自己的女儿，仆人们忘记 小姐也就不足为奇了。牧师用拉丁文自言自语地表示了些惊讶，最后也不 再去想小姐的事了。只慢慢跟在后边，开始为下礼拜天的讲道打一部分腹 稿。
拥有那几条猎犬的乡绅非常高兴另一位乡绅兼猎友的光临。人人对自 己那一行的能手都特别加以赞许，而在猎场上，谁的本领也比不过魏斯顿 先生，谁也没有他那么懂得用声音嗾动猎犬，用呼啦声使行猎活跃起来。
猎人在紧张的追逐中，是顾不得什么仪态和礼节的，甚至连人的基本 职责都置之度外了。要是有一个人出了什么意外，跌到沟里或河里，旁的 人照样驰骋而过，毫不理睬，死活随他去。这当儿，尽管两位乡绅的坐骑 经常靠得很近，彼此并不说话。然而猎场的主人几次看到每当猎犬奔错方 向时，那位陌生人总把它们引回正路上去，他因而十分同意魏斯顿高明的 判断，深深佩服他的见识；自然，魏斯顿的随从人数众多，也使得对方肃 然起敬。因此，引起这场追逐的那只小动物一死，狩猎一结束，两位乡绅 就会晤了，以乡绅之间惯用的方式互相问候起来。
他们的交谈很有趣，不过这我们只能在附录或其他地方来叙述；由于 它与本书无关宏旨，这里只好割爱。第二次的狩猎结束了这段交谈，随 后，东道主设宴。魏斯顿乡绅赴宴，畅饮一通，然后就进入睡乡。
论酒量，这晚上魏斯顿既喝不过主人，也喝不过撒波尔牧师。这完全 是由于他身心疲惫不堪，并无损于他的面子。他确实像一般所说的，业已
烂醉如泥，在饮完第三瓶之前，就已经不中用了。虽然过了好半天才由人 把他抬上床去，可是在牧师心目中，魏斯顿就像不在席上一样。他把关于 苏菲亚的事统统告诉了另外那位乡绅，那位乡绅并且答应：第二天早晨当 牧师力劝魏斯顿乡绅不要再追下去的时候，他也将从旁帮腔。
因此，当这位可敬的乡绅宿酒既醒，又叫人端来晨饮，并且吩咐备马 继续追苏菲亚的时候，撒波尔牧师就劝他还是回家去的好；经东道主竭力 一怂恿，终于把魏斯顿先生说服，他答应不再追下去了。牧师是主要靠一 条道理把乡绅说服的：他并不晓得该走哪条路，说不定他们越走会离苏菲 亚越远哩。于是，他就辞别了狩猎的伙伴，对霜冻过去了表示十分高兴 （这也许在促使他赶回家去的动机中占有不小的位置），出发到一一或者 说得更确切些，退回到萨默塞特郡。动身以前，他先派一部分随从去搜寻 苏菲亚，又尽他所能想出的恶言恶语咒骂了女儿一通。
第三章
琼斯离开厄普顿，以及在路上他和巴特里奇之间发生的事
现在，我们终于又回到本书的男主人公身边来了。我们不得已离开他 这么久，老实说，想到分手时他的处境，我担心许多读者会以为我们打算 永远把他抛弃了。因为稳健的人若遇上朋友处于他那种境地，一般总是不 再去打听他的下文的，唯恐听到他悬梁自尽的消息而大吃一惊。
但是我可以大胆地说，实际上我们既没有稳健的人的一切优点，也没 有他的全部缺点。因此，尽管可怜的琼斯眼下的处境狼狈得无以复加，我 们仍将回到他的身边，以同样的殷勤陪伴他，一如他正飞黄腾达、前途无 限辉煌一样。
琼斯先生和他的同伴巴特里奇在乡绅魏斯顿走后几分钟便离开那家客 栈，徒步沿着同一条路前进，因为马夫告诉他们那时在厄普顿不管怎样也 租不到马的。于是，他们就怀着沉重的心情上了路。虽然他们各自烦恼的 原因不同，心里却都是不痛快的。如果琼斯伤心地叹气，那么巴特里奇也 一步一悲哀地哼哼。
他们来到了乡绅停下来举行军事会议的那个+字路口，琼斯也停下 来，问巴特里奇他认为该奔哪条路。"啊，先生，"巴特里奇回答说，"您要 是听听我的劝告多好哇。""怎么会不听你的，"琼斯说，"反正现在不拘上 哪儿，或者流落到什么地方，对我都是无所谓的。皿那么，"巴特里奇 说，"我劝您立刻向后转，回您府上去。有您那样的家可归的人，谁会像个 流浪汉似的这样到处漂泊呢？请您原谅，sed vox ea sola reperta est[7] o"
"咳，"琼斯嚷道，"我已经无家可归了。不过，纵使我的朋友、我的父 亲肯收容我，我又怎么忍心在苏菲亚逃出的乡间住下来呢？残忍的苏菲 亚！你好残忍呀！不，还是怪我自己吧！不，我要怪你！你这个该死的浑 蛋，这个傻瓜！你毁了我。我要把你撕碎。”说着他一把抓住可怜的巴特里 奇的脖子，拼命使勤摇撼，巴特里奇抖得比打摆子或他自己害怕时还要厉 害。
巴特里奇战战兢兢地跪下来，哀求饶命，发誓说他并没半点恶意。琼 斯狠狠瞪了他一阵，才撒开手，把脾气发泄在自己身上了；如果发到旁人 身上，就会非要那人的命不可，说真的，单是想想就几乎吓死了。
我们要是准晓得读者不嫌麻烦会去阅读，我们自然也不惜费点心血把 琼斯这时的疯狂举动详细描写出来。不过我们深恐尽管作者费了心血，读 者却很可能完全略过去，因此，我们就省掉这份麻烦了。老实说，正是由 于这一点，我们才时常抑制自己的才华，不让它奔放出来，因而把本书应 有的许多很精彩的描述都省略了。坦白说吧，我们照例以自己的邪恶心理 来猜忌读者，每当我们阅读那些卷帙浩繁的史籍时，就往往猛烈地成页成 页跳过去。
简单表上这么一句就够了：琼斯扮演了半天疯子，逐渐清醒过来。他 立刻转向巴特里奇，恳求他原谅刚才发脾气时加给他的伤害。不过最后要 求他再也不许提回家的话了，因为他决计永远也不回去了。
巴特里奇很容易就原谅了他。同时，忠实地答应遵守他刚刚下的命 令。然后，琼斯突然嚷道："既然绝对不可能再追上我的天使了，那么我就 追求英名去吧。走，勇敢的伙计，咱们投军去！这是光荣的事业。即便我 的性命值得保存，我也甘愿为这一事业而牺牲。"说着，他立刻就折入另外 一条（不是乡绅走的）路，那恰巧就是苏菲亚走过的。
两位旅客足足走了一哩地，彼此也没交谈一个字。尽管琼斯不住地自 言自语着，巴特里奇却一声不吭一一也许经过刚才那阵惊恐，他心神还没 安定下来。而且他很怕再把朋友的脾气招惹起来，特别是因为他这时心中 已存下一个读者也许不会感到十分惊奇的念头：简单地说，他开始觉得琼 斯的神经大概已经完全失常了。
最后，琼斯对这么自言自语感到厌烦了，就向伙伴搭话，并怪他不该 这么一声不响。这个可怜的人老老实实地说是怕惹他生气。琼斯一口答应 决不会见怪，这样一来，巴特里奇的恐惧差不多消除了，就又撒开舌头的 缰绳，那舌头顿时就像脱缰的马驹子那样朝草地奔去，为重获自由而欢 快。
既然琼斯不许巴特里奇谈他最想谈的那个问题，于是，他只好谈起他 第二个想谈的问题：山中人。"先生，"他说，"像他那样奇装异服，生活跟 大家都不一样，他准不是个人。而且，照那老奶奶说的，他成天吃的主要 是草类，那可以作马的饲料，却决不适宜作人的食物。我还听厄普顿那个 客栈老板说，左近的邻居对他有很可怕的想法。我总觉得他必然是个什么 妖怪，特意来预先警告咱们：既然咱们现在是去打仗，焉知道他讲的那些 事情一一他的从军、被俘、险些给吊死一一不是对咱们的警告？而且昨天
夜里我做了一夜的梦，梦的全是打仗。我觉得血从我鼻子里咕嘟咕嘟地 淌，就像拔开塞子的酒桶似的。真的，先生，infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem[8]。”
"巴特里奇，"琼斯说，"这个故事和你讲的拉丁文几乎同样不恰当。对 于前往战场的人，死是很可能的，说不定咱们都会阵亡。那将怎样 呢怎样？”巴特里奇回答说，"咱们就完蛋啦，还不是吗？我一死，一 切就都和我不相干了。要是我阵亡了的话，正义不正义，谁胜谁败，跟我 还有什么关系？我永远也分享不到好处的。一切胜利的钟声和篝火对于埋 在地下六叭深的人有什么意义？那样，可怜的巴特里奇就完事大吉 了。""可怜的巴特里奇迟早总有一天要完事大吉的，"琼斯嚷道，"既然你 爱拉丁文，我就从贺拉斯的诗里背几行足以叫懦夫勇敢起来的佳句吧：
Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori : Mors et fugacem persequitur virum,
Nec parcit imbellis juvente
Poplitibus, timidoque tergo。[9]
"您最好把它翻译出来，"巴特里奇大声说，"因为贺拉斯的诗很不好 懂，照您刚才背的，我没法懂。”
"那么我就用我的拙劣的模拟，或者说是解释，为你重述一遍，"琼斯 说，"因为我在作诗方面并不怎么高明：
谁不愿为亲爱的祖国而捐躯？ 即使贪生怕死，也躲不过死亡。 不论懦夫还是勇将， 归宿都是同一墓场。
“当然是这样，”巴特里奇大声说，“当然，Mors omnibus communis、不过，像个好基督教徒那样终其天年，在至亲好友的哭声中 死去，毕竟和不定今天或明天就被人当条疯狗枪杀掉，或者被乱刀砍成碎 块、来不及忏悔就死掉大不相同。啊，求上帝发发慈悲！当兵的确实都是 坏人。我一向不愿同他们打交道。我没法把他们当作基督教徒看待。他们
只晓得诅咒，骂野话。我希望您反悔，我衷心希望您趁现在还来得及的时 候反悔，不再想跟他们混在一起。跟恶人往来必染上恶习。这是我反对当 兵的主要原因。至于说到死亡，我决不比旁人更害怕；怕的，决不是我。
我晓得人终有一死，尽管如此，人毕竟还是可以活上许多年。就拿我来说 吧，如今刚刚中年，我还能活好些年呢。我从书上看到有些人活到一百多 岁，甚至大大超过一百岁。并不是我也希望这样，我是说，我并不一定也 能那么长寿；可是（感谢上帝！）哪怕活上八九十岁呢，那日子也还长得 很呢。到那时候，我不会比任何人更怕死的。但是离该死的日子还这么远 就去找死，我认为真是造孽，是胡闹。再者，这么早死掉究竟会有什么好 处？不管是为什么去打仗，咱们两个人又能干得出什么来？至于我，对打 仗是一窍不通。一辈子我也没放过十次枪，而且还都是没装子弹的。至于 刀剑，我从来也没学过击剑，一点也不会。至于去惹大炮，那就再狂妄不 过了。只有疯子才会……请原谅我。向您起誓，我确实没什么恶意。求求 您啦，可别让我再招您发一通脾气。”
"不用害怕，巴特里奇，"琼斯大声说，"我现在完全确信你是个胆小鬼 了，所以不管怎样你也不可能再叫我生气了。""您尽可以喊我作胆小鬼或 旁的什么，"巴特里奇说，"倘若乐意保全自己的身体发肤就成为胆小鬼的 话，那么non immunes ab illis malis sumus[ii]。我在书里从没读过好人 必得打仗这种说法。Vir bonus est quis ? Qui consulta patrum，qui leges juraque servat.也这里没有一个字提到打仗的事。我确信《圣经》 十分反对打仗。如果一个人让基督教徒流血，我决不相信他本人会是个好 基督教徒。”
第四章
-个乞丐的奇遇
前一章的末尾，正当巴特里奇在那里发挥他那套既虔诚又合乎道德的 高论时，他们二人又来到一个十字路口。一个穿得破破烂烂的瘸子求他们 布施。巴特里奇厉声责备他说："每个教区都应该养活自己的穷人。"琼斯 听了哈哈大笑，不禁质问巴特里奇："你嘴上那么多仁慈，而心里却一点仁 慈也没有，难道你不害臊吗？你只是用宗教来掩盖自己的过失，却丝毫不 以它来激发你的德行。一个真正的基督教徒能不帮助一下陷入这样悲惨境 地的弟兄吗？”话音未落，他就把手伸到衣袋里去，给了那个可怜人一个先 令。
"老爷，"那个汉子道谢后喊道，"我口袋里有件奇怪的东西，是我在离 这儿两哩来路的地方拾到的。求老爷把它买下吧。我不敢随便拿给人看。 不过既然您是这么好心肠的绅士，对穷人这么慈悲，您不会因为我穷就怀 疑我是个贼的。"说着，他掏出一个金边的小皮夹子来，递给琼斯。
琼斯立刻把它打开（请读者猜猜他当时的心情吧），看到第一页上写 着"苏菲亚•魏斯顿"，是她用端丽的字迹亲笔写下的。一读到那名字，他马 上就把它紧紧贴到唇边。尽管旁边有人，他也禁不住欢喜若狂；不过也许 正因为狂喜他才忘记身边有人了。
琼斯捧着那个皮夹子，一边吻一边喃喃自语，恰似他嘴里正嚼着一片 烤得焦黄的奶油面包，又好像他是条蛀书虫，要不就犹如一个除了自己的 手稿之外别无东西可吃的作家。这时，皮夹子里忽然掉出一张纸来。巴特 里奇拾起来递给琼斯，他一看，原来是张钞票一一正是魏斯顿在他女儿出 逃的头天晚上给她的那张票子。即使是一个犹太人，也会毫不犹豫地以比 一百镑少五个先令的代价把这张钞票买下来的。
一听琼斯大声说出钞票的数目，巴特里奇两眼就发亮了，那个拾到皮 夹子的穷汉子从另一个角度也兴奋起来。乞丐（我希望是出于老实）一直 没打开皮夹子看。不过，倘若我们不让大家知道这里一个颇为重要的情 节，那么我们对读者也不老实了。事实是：那汉子并不识字。
最初找到这个皮夹子时，琼斯只觉得欣喜若狂；但这个新发现却使他 同时又感到担忧。因为他当即想到在他设法把票子还给原主之前，她可能
很需要它。然后，他告诉拾到皮夹子的人说，他认识这皮夹子的女主人， 打算尽快找到她，把它还给她。
这只皮夹子是魏斯顿女士从一个有名的玩具商手里买到，最近送给侄 女的，价钱是二十五先令。但是皮夹子上的银扣子实际上值十八个便士。 原来的那个玩具商一定愿意出原价再把它买回去，因为皮夹子新得像刚卖 出去时一样。可是一个精细的人大概会利用这汉子不懂货色，顶多只肯出 一先令，甚至六个便士；有的甚至一文也不肯给，而任凭那个汉子提出要 求偿还被侵占财物的诉讼。就当前的案情来看，有些渊博的律师也许怀疑 原告能否胜诉。
琼斯为人则极端慷慨，说他挥金如土也不为过。他毫不犹豫地用一个 基尼换过那只皮夹子。那个可怜的汉子好久没见过这么多钱，就向琼斯先 生千恩万谢，脸上露出的狂喜正像琼斯初看到皮夹子上苏菲亚•魏斯顿的名 字时一样。
那汉子欣然答应陪这两位旅客回到他拾得皮夹子的地方去。于是，他 们一同前往，可是速度没有琼斯先生所希望的那么快，因为那个带路的不 幸是个瘸子，一小时走不上一哩路。这地方距此三哩开外（尽管那个汉子 说只有两哩），就不必向读者交代他们走了多久了。
一路上，琼斯把皮夹子打开了一百回，也吻了一百回，常常自言自语 着，很少理会他的同伴。那汉子看到这般情景，对巴特里奇表示了些惊 奇。巴特里奇不止一次地摇着头，大声说道：“可怜的人，orandum est ut sit mens sana in corpore sano[13]
他们终于来到苏菲亚不幸失落皮夹子又幸而被汉子拾到的那个地方。 这时，琼斯要跟带路的汉子告别，好加快脚步。可是那汉子刚接到一个基 尼时所感到的惊喜如今已经消失殆尽了。他从从容容地寻思了一下，脸上 露出不满的神情，挠了挠头说，希望老爷再多赏他几文。"您想，"汉子 说，"我要不是个老实人，早就把钱完全留下了。”这话读者想必也认为是 实情。"要是那张票子值一百镑，"他说，"拾到票子的人总不应该只配得到 一个基尼。而且，假使老爷永远也见不到那位小姐，或者见了也不交给她 呢？尽管从外表和谈吐上看，老爷是个上流人，我也不能光凭您一句话。 万一原主找不到，我想东西当然应统统属于最初拾到的人。希望老爷把这 些道理想一想。我是个穷人，我并不想全部独自吞下；可是也总该有我应 得的一份呀。老爷看来是个好人，希望您也考虑考虑我这份老实态度。本
来我满可以全部吞下来，谁也不会晓得的。""我用人格向你担保，"琼斯大 声说，"我确实认识这物件的原主，并且一定把原物归还给她。""老爷要怎 么办都成，”那汉子回答说，"只要老爷把我应得的那份给我，就只要一 半，剩下的钱老爷尽可以自己留下。"最后他还狠狠地发一通誓，说他决不 向任何人吐露一个字儿。
"听着，朋友，"琼斯大声说，"我一定把原主所丢的钱分文不少地还给 她。至于再赏你什么，我眼下实在办不到。可是倘若你把姓名、住址留给 我，有朝一日你很可能更有理由来庆幸今天早晨撞上的运气。”
"我不晓得您说撞运气是什么意思，"那汉子嚷道，"看来您究竟把钱归 还给那位小姐还是自己吞下，我倒要撞撞运气哩。不过我还是希望老爷考 虑一下……皿得啦，得啦，”巴特里奇说，"把你的姓名和地址告诉给老 爷，我担保你日后一定不会后悔把钱交给他的。"最后，那汉子看到已没指 望能把皮夹子要过来，只好遵命报了他的姓名和住址，琼斯就用苏菲亚的 铅笔一一记在一个纸条上。然后，他把那纸条夹在苏菲亚写上自己的名字 的那一页，大声说："啊，朋友，你是世上最幸福的人了。我已经把你的名 字同天使的名字放在一起啦。""我不懂什么天使不天使的，”那汉子回答 说，"不过我希望您再赏我点钱，要不就把皮夹子还给我。"这时，巴特里 奇按捺不住了，用一些极其恶毒、肮脏的话骂了可怜的瘸子几句，还几乎 动手打他。但琼斯不容许他这样。琼斯对那汉子说，将来一定会找到机会 来酬劳他的，说完就尽力急急往前赶。巴特里奇一想到那一百镑，精神也 来了，紧紧跟上。那汉子只好落在后面，一路骂着他们两个，也骂自己的 爹妈。他说："他们要是把我送到慈善学堂去读书识字，学学算术，我也就 和旁人一样晓得那件东西的价值了。”
第五章
琼斯先生和他的同伴在旅途中的另一些奇遇
这两位旅客现在走得飞快，简直连交谈的时间或气力都没有了。琼斯 一路上一个勤儿思念着苏菲亚，巴特里奇则想着那张钞票。这一百镑虽然 给了他一些喜悦，同时也引起他抱怨自己运气不佳，走了这么多路还没遇 上这样一个足以表现廉洁的机会。他们走出三哩多路，巴特里奇再也跟不 上了，就喊住琼斯，央求他略微放慢步子。琼斯也乐得马上照办，因为最 初几哩地由于路上的冰雪化了，可以循着马蹄印子前进，从刚才起他就找 不到马蹄印子了。他们来到一片辽阔的公地，这里有几条路。
琼斯就在这儿停下来，考虑该走哪一条路。忽然听到一阵阵似乎从不 远处传来的鼓声，这声音立刻使巴特里奇惊慌万分，他喊叫道："上帝慈悲 慈悲吧，准是他们来啦谁来啦？"琼斯大声问道，他心里的恐怖感早就 被一片缠绵之情所代替了。自从碰到那个瘸子，他一心一意只想要追上苏 菲亚，敌人不敌人，他早抛在脑后了。"谁？还不是叛军！ ”巴特里奇嚷 道，"可是我凭什么管他们叫叛军！尽管人家说他们是坏人，说不定他们很 好呢。哼，叫那些对抗他们的人见魔鬼去吧。他们要是不冒犯我，我决不 会去惹他们。我跟他们客客气气的。天哪，先生，要是他们来了可千万别 去惹他们。也许他们不会伤害咱们。如果咱们躲到那边树丛里，等他们走 过再出来岂不更明智些？咱们俩手无寸铁，怎么干得过说不定是五万大 军?只有疯子才会……先生，请不要动气……除非那些mens sana in corpore sano[14]的人……”这时，琼斯打断巴特里奇因恐怖而发的长篇大 论，对他说，从鼓声可以听出他们离城镇不远了。于是，他就朝着那声音 笔直走去，叫巴特里奇壮起胆子，说他决不会把他引向危险的境地；又 说，叛军不可能距离这么近。
最后这一点保证使巴特里奇稍微放心了。尽管他更愿意走相反的一条 路，可他还是跟着他的首领。他的心按着鼓声的节奏咚咚跳着，可并不是 像个英雄那样。直到他们穿过公地，进了一条窄巷，鼓声才停下来。
这时，紧跟在琼斯身后的巴特里奇发现前边几码地方有一些涂成五颜 六色的东西在空中招展。他以为那是叛军的旗帜，就嘶声叫道："哎呀，我 的上帝！先生，他们果然在这儿。瞧，那不是王冠和棺材四吗！啊，上帝！ 我从没见过这么可怕的东西。咱们已经在他们的射程之内了。”
琼斯一抬头，就清清楚楚地看出巴特里奇把什么误当作叛军的旗帜 了。"巴特里奇，"他说，"我看你一个人就对付得了这整支军队。从那些颜 色，我猜得出刚才的鼓声是怎么回事了。那是招人去看木偶戏。”
"木偶戏！”巴特里奇兴高采烈地说，"真的只是木偶戏吗？在世上的一 切游艺里，我顶爱看的就是木偶戏了。好先生，咱们无论如何也停下来看 看吧。而且我饿得要命。现在天都快黑了，从早晨三点起，我还没吃过一 口东西呢。”
这时，他们来到一家客栈，或者说一家酒馆。经巴特里奇一劝，琼斯 就停了下来。这毋宁是由于他对该不该走这条路不再有把握了。他俩都一 直来到厨房，琼斯问早晨可有女客们从这儿路过，巴特里奇则急于想知道 店里有什么可以饱肚子的。关于苏菲亚的消息琼斯什么也没打听出来，巴 特里奇却颇有收获：因为一会儿他就可以心满意足地看到热腾腾一盘美味 的火腿鸡蛋了。
爱情对一个体格健壮的人所起的作用迥然不同于一个身体孱弱的人。 对于后者，爱情往往会败坏赖以维持生命的胃口。对于前者，虽然爱情使 得本人健忘，顾不得吃东西，还有其他种种情况，可是倘若把一块烹调可 口的牛肉摆在一位饥饿的情郎面前，他总还是不免要饱餐起来的。当前正 是这般情景：尽管如果琼斯是独自走路，不经人提醒，他还会空着肚子走 上老远，可是如今坐到火腿鸡蛋面前，他立刻就和巴特里奇一样狼吞虎咽 起来了。
两位旅客还没吃完饭，夜幕就已垂下。更兼是下弦月，天色+分昏 暗。因此，巴特里奇劝琼斯停下来看看马上就要开演的木偶戏。戏班的班 主也竭力请他们赏光，说他耍的木偶是世上顶精致的，英国大小城市的上 流人士看了无不满意。
木偶戏的演出井然有序，也很规矩，演的是《激怒的丈夫》也一剧里细 腻而严肃的部分。那的确是一幕十分庄重而一本正经的表演，没有任何下 流话或是诙谐、幽默的东西，平心而论，戏里没一点可以称作笑料的。观 众都非常满意。一位端庄的妇女对戏班班主说，明晚她要带两个女儿来 看，因为演得一点也不下流。一个律师的录事和一个税务官也一致称赞唐 利勋爵夫妇演得恰到好处，而且颇为真切。巴特里奇也同意了这个看法。
戏班班主听了这些赞扬的话高兴得很，他不禁自己又吹嘘了几句："现 今这个时代，任何进步也赶不上木偶戏。自从我们把彭赤和他的妻子朱安以
以及类似的胡闹角色取消以后，木偶戏终于变成一个合乎理性的娱乐了。 记得我刚刚干这一行时，还有许多专逗人乐的下流玩意儿，根本不注意去 培养青年人的道德，而这正应当是每一出木偶戏的主旨。为什么木偶戏就 不能像其他戏剧一样惩恶扬善、移风易俗呢？我的木偶戏不亚于真实的人 生，五花八门的生活都能表演。我相信人们看了我这种小戏会同看了大戏 一样得到益处。""我决不来贬低你这一行的独出心裁，"琼斯说，"尽管这 样，我仍然愿意看到我的老朋友彭赤先生。把他和他那个愉快的老婆朱安 取消，不但没改进木偶戏，怕是反而把它降低了。”
耍木偶的听了琼斯这话，立刻表示轻藐，带着满脸看不起的神情 说："先生，这很可能就是您的看法。不过我相信高明的批评家决不会支持 您的。戏当然不能满足所有人的胃口。两三年前巴思确实有些上流人很起 勤地要把彭赤重新搬上舞台。我由于不赞成这个意见，金钱上还蒙受了些 损失。别人爱怎么办就怎么办吧，我决不能为着一点钱财就糟践了我这行 当。我也永远不会同意让这种下流东西出现，破坏舞台的庄重和体统。”
"朋友，对，"那个录事大声说，"你说得很有道理。下流东西永远也演 不得。我在伦敦有几个朋友，他们下决心要把舞台上一切下流东西清除 掉。""那样做是完全对的，”税务官把烟斗从嘴上拔下来，嚷道。然后又 说："我记得《激怒的丈夫》初次上演的那个夜晚。当时我正住在我们老爷 家，我在顶层楼座和男仆坐在一起观看。戏里有不少下流东西，描写一个 乡绅到城里去竞选议员，还把他的一群仆人全搬上了舞台，我特别记得他 那个赶车的。可是我们顶层楼座的先生们对这些下流东西感到受不了，就 骂了起来。可是我看你把这些情节全给删掉了，删得好！ ”
"诸位先生，"琼斯大声说，"我一个人没法驳倒这么多人的看法。要是 大部分观众讨厌彭赤，那么这位学问渊博的戏班老板把他赶下台去也很有 道理。”
戏班班主再一次长篇大论地演说起来。他谈到惩恶扬善的巨大力量， 说倘若下等人看到上等人的恶习、败行多么可鄙，就足以制止他们自己的 堕落。正说着，不幸有一件事把他的话打断了。这件事如果换个别的时 候，我们也许就不去叙述了，现在却不能不讲几句，可是要留待下章来叙 述。

第六章
从这一章可以看出，天大的好事也会引起误会或被人所误解
这时，客栈的门道里传来一片嘈杂声，老板娘正在那儿一边骂一边用 拳头打她的女用人。她想支使那个女人，可是找不到她了。搜索了半天才 发现她正在台上陪着戏班子里的丑角一一当时的情景就不便在这里描写 了。
尽管葛蕾丝（那就是女用人的名字）早已不在乎什么叫害臊了，然而 她还不至于厚着脸皮公然否认她被当场抓住的作为。因此，她换了个办 法，企图减轻自己的过错。"老板娘，你干吗这么死命打我！"女用人 说，"你要是不喜欢我的行为，就辞退我好啦。假若我是个婊子（对方满嘴 这么叫着她），上流女人也全跟我一个样。刚才木偶戏里那个贵妇人也算个 什么？我想她离开丈夫成夜在外面睡觉总不会白睡吧！”
现在老板娘奔到厨房，对她丈夫和那个可怜的耍木偶的大发脾 气。"瞧，当家的，"她说，"你瞧让这帮人住在咱店里有什么后果！多卖几 杯酒也抵不上他们给店里带来的麻烦，而且还让这些害虫把这地方搞成窑 子啦。一句话，我要你们明天早晨全给我走，我再也不能容忍你们这么胡 闹下去了。这只能教店里的用人学会了偷懒和胡来，因为从这种无聊的表 演一定学不到什么更好的东西的。我记得从前木偶戏净表演一些《圣经》 里的好故事，譬如《耶弗他轻率的许愿》四一类有益的东西；那时的戏里， 恶人都给魔鬼抓走了。这种表演还有点道理。不过，正像牧师上礼拜天所 说的，如今谁也不相信有魔鬼了。你们弄来这么一堆扮成男女贵族的木 偶，只不过把可怜的乡下丫头们都弄昏了头。她们脑袋一昏，就难怪什么 蠢事都干出来了。”
我记得维吉尔曾说过，当乌合之众吵吵闹闹，砖瓦棍棒四飞的时候， 倘若有一位庄重而有威信的人物在他们中间出现，就会立刻使他们平定下 来。聚集的群氓可以比作一头驴，那位庄严的人物一开口，驴就竖起长耳 朵了。
反过来说，当一群态度庄重的人或哲学家正在争辩什么问题，而智慧 本身可以说是也在座，而且主持着这场争辩时，如果乌合之众忽然掀起一 片骚动，或者在那群哲学家中间出现一位泼妇（她一人的叫骂声就相当于
一大帮群氓）,辩论就会立即停止下来，智慧也不再履行职务，大家的注 意力马上就会全被叫骂声吸引去了。
上面提到的那片嘈杂声和老板娘的来临就这样封住了木偶戏班班主的 嘴巴，迅速而彻底地结束了他那番庄严的长篇大论，读者想来已经充分领 会其滋味了。再没有比这件事来得更不凑巧的了。任凭命运怎样阴险毒 辣，也设不下这样一个圈套，弄得正在那里趾高气扬地吹嘘他的表演如何 有益于世道人心的这个可怜汉子简直不知所措。他的嘴巴立刻给封得紧紧 的，就像一个江湖郎中，正当他在吹嘘自己的灵丹妙药如有神效的时候， 忽然有人抬来一具牺牲于他手下的尸体，摆在那里，作为他的医术的证 明。
戏班班主并没回答老板娘的话，却跑出去责罚那个扮丑角的。这时， 月亮正像诗人所说的，放出银色的光辉（其实，那会儿她看起来更像一块 黄铜）。琼斯吩咐算账，告诉刚给老板娘从酣睡中吵醒的巴特里奇准备启 程。巴特里奇曾两次劝说琼斯（读者已经看到），这时他胆子更壮了，又 第三次向琼斯进忠言，劝他当晚就住在这家客栈里。在琼斯先生要动身 时，巴特里奇故意装作很惊讶，然后就开始劝说起来。他先提出许多极响 亮的理由来反对当晚动身，坚持说这样做毫无意义，因为除非琼斯确知那 位小姐的去向，否则多走一步就很可能离她更远一步。"先生，这家客栈里 的人都说她走的不是这条路，"他说，"所以咱们何不等到明天早晨再走， 说不定会遇上人，可以打听打听。”
最后这个理由倒确实打动了琼斯的心。正当他有些犹豫的时候，客栈 老板也在天平的这一头加上他所擅长的一套言词。他说："真的先生，您这 位仆人给您出的主意再好不过了。在这个季节里，谁会这么三更半夜还上 路呢？”随后，他就像往常那样吹嘘起他这家客栈设备如何舒适，同时，老 板娘乘机也开始了……不过我不想用客栈老板和老板娘那些老一套的话来 对读者啰嗦了。总之，琼斯终于被说服了，决定在客栈里住下来，歇上几 个钟头；其实，他是很需要这么做的，因为自从离开他在那里被打破了头 的那家客栈以后，就几乎没合过一次眼。
琼斯决定当晚不再赶路之后，立刻就带着两个心爱的伴侣（皮夹子和 手笼）睡觉去了。可是曾经打过几次盹儿休息过来的巴特里奇，想的却是 吃而不是睡，还有比吃睡都好的酒。
葛蕾丝所引起的一场风波已经平息，老板娘又跟戏班班主和解了。他 也不再去计较这妇人在盛怒之下对他的表演所作的指责。厨房里是一片恬 静、和睦的气氛。客栈老板、老板娘、戏班班主、录事、税务官和机智的 巴特里奇先生都围炉而坐。这群人谈得十分畅快。内容如何请看下章。
第七章
作者的三言两语以及聚在厨房里的人们更多的议论
尽管巴特里奇的自尊心不允许他承认自己是琼斯的仆人，可是他一举 —动却处处模仿仆人的样子。举一个例子来说，他总竭力夸耀他这位伙伴 （他对琼斯的称呼）的家财，所有的仆人遇到生人时照例都是如此，谁也 不甘心被人当作一个叫花子的仆人看待。主子的地位越高，仆人会认为自 己的身价也随着高了起来。从一切贵族听差的一举一动看来，情况确是如 此。
爵位和财产会给予周围的人一种光彩。家当大、身份高的人总受到人 们的尊敬，他的仆人自认为也可以分享这种尊贵。然而在品德和才识方面 却显然不是这样。这种卓越之处只能专属于本人，因此而受到的尊敬别人 是无法分享的。而且老实说，这方面能受到的尊敬微乎其微，他们也经不 起让旁人来分享。既然主人在这些方面受到的尊敬仆人是没有份的，那么 倘若主人在品德和才识上有极其严重的缺陷，仆人也不会受到玷辱。当 然，倘若女主人在所谓品格上有缺陷，那又另当别论，其后果我们在前边 已经看到。这种耻辱好像贫穷，有传染作用，接近的人全会受到感染。
基于这些理由，难怪做仆人的（我指的只是男仆）那么在乎主人在财 产方面的名气，而不大在乎一一或者完全不在乎主人在其他方面的声誉； 他们耻于给乞丐当听差，对伺候坏蛋或蠢货倒无所谓，竟至毫无顾忌地尽 量散布他们主人的邪恶或愚蠢行径，而且往往还带着幽默和取笑的心情。 实际上，一个听差的虽然穿的是主人的号衣，却往往是个专拿主人开玩笑 的花花公子和说俏皮话的人。
因此，巴特里奇极力夸大琼斯将要继承的巨产，又信口透露出他自己 担心的一个情况：前一天他就已经有了这种念头，我们当时也曾暗示了一 下，而琼斯的举止似乎的确提供了充分的根据。简而言之，他现在确信这 位主人已经神经失常了，而且径直把这个看法对围炉而坐的那些人说了。
木偶戏班班主立刻表示也有同感。"听到那位先生对木偶戏发出的那套 荒唐议论，"他说，"我不得不承认大吃一惊。很难设想一个头脑清醒的人 会那么荒谬；听您刚才说的那番话，我就恍然明白他那些怪诞想法的来由 了。可怜的人！我衷心为他不安。他眼睛里确实有一种奇特的直愣愣的神 情。我以前就理会到了，不过我没说出来。”
客栈老板对最后这一点完全同意，为了表明自己的机智，他也说自己 早就看出来了。"他准是神经失常了，"他又加上一句，"只有一个疯子才会 想到在三更半夜离开这么舒服的客栈去野地里瞎闯。”
税务官从嘴里拔出烟斗，说他也觉得那位先生的神情和言谈有些不可 思议。然后转过来对巴特里奇说："倘若他真疯了，就不应该让他在乡下瞎 跑，说不定他会闯出乱子。可惜没人把他抓住，送到他亲属那里去。”
这时，巴特里奇心里也闪过这样的念头：既然他确信琼斯是从奥尔华 绥先生家里逃出来的，那么倘若他能把他弄回去，一定会得到厚赏。不过 他几次看到，并且亲自领教过琼斯强大的膂力，因而颇有戒心，认为不可 能把琼斯抓住，所以对于拟定实现此举的具体计划也就不那么起劲了。可 是他一听到税务官的意见，立刻乘机说出自己的想法，并且表示衷心希望 这件事能够实现。
"可以办到的！"税务官说，"这再容易不过了。”
"啊，先生，"巴特里奇回答说，"您不晓得他有多么厉害。他足可以用 一只手把我提起来，从窗口扔出去。而且他会这么做的，万一他想到……”
"瞎扯，"税务官说，"我自信是跟他一样的好汉。何况咱们还是五个人 呢。”
"我不晓得什么五个不五个的，"老板娘大声说，"反正我丈夫不会掺进 去的。而且无论什么人也不许在店里对谁动武。那位少爷是我生平少见的 —个美男子，我相信他不比咱们任何人疯狂。你们凭什么瞎说他眼神带着 一种直愣愣的表情？在我看来，他那对眼睛再漂亮不过了，神情也十分可 爱，他是位非常谦恭有礼的少爷。自从听到坐在屋角的那位先生说他失恋 了，我一直打心坎上怜惜他呢。谁失了恋，神情上也会跟过去有些两样 的，尤其像他那样一位可爱的少爷。嗨，这小姐！除了这样一位又漂亮又 有家当的男人，她还能找到更好的吗？她想必是个上流女人，就像昨晚上 木偶戏里的唐利夫人，这种人简直就不晓得自己该干些什么。”
录事也说在向律师请示之前，决不参加这件事。他说："假如有人告咱 们非法逮捕，咱们怎么辩护呢？谁晓得要有怎样的证据才能使陪审团承认 他是个疯子呢？我只是就我自己而言，因为一个律师不便纠缠到这类事情 里面去，除非是以律师的身份。陪审团对我们总是比对一般人更严一些。 因此，我并不劝阻您（对税务官说），汤姆逊先生，或者这位先生以及其 他任何人参与这件事。”
税务官听了这话摇了摇头。木偶戏班班主说："由陪审团来断定一个人 疯不疯，有时候是困难的。记得有一回审理疯人案件的时候，我也在场。 二十个人出庭起誓作证说那汉子疯得像一只三月的野兔，另外又有二十个 说他跟任何英国人一样正常。其实，大部分人认为，那只是他的亲戚为了 侵夺他的财产继承权而玩的一种把戏。”
"很可能正是这样！"老板娘嚷道，"我自己就认识一位可怜的先生，他 的亲戚把他在疯人院里关了一辈子，由他们去享用这人的产业。可是，这 对他们有什么好处？尽管法律把财产判给他们，产权却还是另外那个人 的。”
"瞎扯！ ”录事带着极其轻蔑的口吻说，"谁的产权还不都是法律判给 的，要是法律把国内最好的一份财产判给我，我才不会去管产权归谁所有 呢！ ”
“要是那样，”巴特里奇说，“Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum.四”
客栈老板刚才因为有骑马的人来到门口，被叫了出去；这时又回到厨 房来，神色惊慌地嚷道：“诸位先生，你们可知道是怎么啦？叛军摆脱了公 爵的堵截，目前快打到伦敦啦。这话一点也不会假，是刚才那个骑马的人 告诉我的。”
“我听了打心坎上高兴，"巴特里奇大声说，“这样一来，这一带就不会 有战事了。”
“我有更好的理由可以高兴，"录事嚷道，“我一向认为，权利应得到维 护。”
“对，"客栈老板说，“不过我听有人说这个人并没有权利。”
“我立刻就可以给你证明不是这样，"录事大声说，“要是我父亲死时名 下有一笔产业一一请听明白啦，属于他名下的一笔产业，他去世了，产权 难道不该由他的儿子继承？产权应该传下去，难道旁的权利不同样应该传 下去？"
“可是他有什么权利把咱们变成天主教徒［电呢？"老板说。
“这一点你不必担心，"巴特里奇大声说，“权利问题，这位先生已经论 证得很清楚。至于宗教方面，情形完全不是这样。天主教徒并不指望这 样。我认识一位天主教神父，一个老实人。他用人格担保，发誓说他们决 没有这种打算。”
"我认识的一个神父也对我这么说，"老板娘说，"可是我丈夫一向总是 怕天主教徒。其实，我认识好多天主教徒，都是很规矩的人，花起钱来大 方极了。我一向认为：只要有钱可赚，谁的都是一样。”
"说得很对，老板娘，"耍木偶的人说，"只要长老会四不当权，我才不 在乎来什么宗教呢一一长老会是木偶戏的死对头。”
"这么说来你为了能赚钱宁可牺牲宗教，"税务官大声说，"情愿让天主 教到英国来，对吗？"
"我当然不愿意，"戏班班主说，"我跟大家一样恨天主教。可是天主教 总还让人活下去，这不能不说是一种安慰，而在长老会下面，你根本活不 了。每个人首先注意的是生计，这一点你不能不承认。我敢保证，倘若你 掏出心窝里的话，你比旁人更怕丢掉差事。不过，放心吧，朋友，无论谁 当政也总是要收税的。”
"可不是吗，"税务官回答说，"如果我不尊敬给我面包吃的国王，那我 这人可真是要不得了。谁都会说，这是当然的。旁人当政也要收税，可那 又与我何干呢；那时候朝里的我的朋友卸任了，我也势必得随着他们滚 蛋。不，不，朋友，我决不能因为希望换个政府还能保全差使而抛开我的 宗教，因为那样我的情况肯定不会更好，却很可能会更糟。”
"对！"老板嚷道，"每当有人告诉我将来会如何如何的时候，我也这么 回答。嘿！难道我会那么蠢，会随便把钱借给一个生人，只因为他将来可 能会还给我？我相信有钱还是放在自己的橱柜里妥当，所以我就把它放在 那儿。”
录事非常赏识巴特里奇的明智，不是由于录事精通人情世故，就是由 于两人意气相投一一他们都是雅各宾党的真正信徒。这时，两人热烈地握 手，并且饮了不少杯烈酒，祝某某人性健康；此人的名字我们认为最好从 略。
后来所有在场的人也都参加了祝酒，甚至客栈老板也参加进来，尽管 有些勉强；因为他受不了录事的恫吓，录事说：要是老板不饮，他就永远 不再光顾这家客栈了。喝下的那些酒很快就把他们的谈话结束了，因此， 我们也就此结束本章。
第八章
命运这回对琼斯好像比以往我们见到的要客气得多
再没有比疲倦更有益于健康，因而或许也没有比它更有效的安眠药 了。这味药琼斯可以说是已经服了很大一剂，在他身上起了强烈的作用。 他已足足睡了九个小时，倘若不是卧室门口一阵巨响一一沉重的拳头声加 上"杀人啦！”的喊叫一一把他吵醒，他也许还会睡下去的。琼斯立刻跳下 床来，看到戏班班主正在毫不留情地捶打那个可怜的丑角的脊梁和肋骨。
琼斯立刻站在挨揍的一方出面干预，把那个气势汹汹的征服者按在墙 上。戏班班主气力敌不过琼斯，正像那个穿得五颜六色的小丑不是他自己 的对手一样。
尽管这个丑角个子小，力气又单薄，可是他却颇有些胆子。他一挣脱 出来立刻就使出他唯一可以敌得过对方的武器来，发动了攻势。他先泛泛 地骂了几句，然后就转入更具体的指控："妈的，你这个流氓，"他说，"我 不但养活了你（因为你的钱全是我挣的），而且还把你从绞刑架上救了下 来。昨天你不是还想在后街抢那位小姐的漂亮的骑装吗？难道你能否认你 曾希望把她独自堵在一座树林里，把她剥光一一把天下最漂亮的一位小姐 剥光？如今你朝我扑过来，差点把我打死。我并没欺负这儿的这个姑娘， 我们俩是两相情愿；你打我，也不过是因为她喜欢我而不喜欢你。”
琼斯一听这话，就放开老板，同时严词禁止他再去侮辱丑角。然后就 把那个可怜的家伙带到自己的房间里，很快就打听到了苏菲亚的消息；原 来前一天这个丑角打着鼓跟班主走的时候，看到苏菲亚走过去。琼斯没怎 么费力就说服那个小伙子答应领他到那个地方去一趟，一面把巴特里奇喊 来，说要急忙动身。
差不多八点钟光景才把一切办理停当，因为巴特里奇总是不急不忙 的，账也不是一下子就能算好。等一切都办理就绪之后，琼斯还一定要把 戏班班主和那小伙子之间的争吵完全调解好了才肯动身。
这件事顺利完成之后，琼斯就上路了。那个忠实的丑角把他们领到苏 菲亚路过的地方，琼斯厚酬了这个带路人，然后就急急向前走去，心里为 了无意中得到苏菲亚这个消息而非常高兴。巴特里奇一听说事情的经过， 就十分认真地预卜琼斯一定会获得美满的成功。他说：上帝要不是有意让
琼斯和苏菲亚成为眷属，就决不会用两件巧遇来指引他。这是琼斯头一回 对他这位同伴的迷信说法感到些兴趣。
他们刚走两哩来地，就碰上一场暴雨。这时，恰好望到一家酒店，巴 特里奇拼命劝琼斯进去避避雨。饥饿这个敌人（倘若可以这么说的话）的 气质更像英国人而不像法国人，不管你多少次把它击退，它还会卷土重 来。巴特里奇现在的情形就是这样。他刚一踏进厨房，就照样提出头天晚 上问过的那句话。结果，桌上摆出了一盘美味的冷里脊。不但巴特里奇， 连琼斯也饱餐了一顿。不过琼斯又焦灼不安起来，因为酒店里谁也不能告 诉他一些关于苏菲亚的新情况。
吃完饭，尽管雨依然下得很大，琼斯还是准备上路。可是巴特里奇一 再央求要再饮一杯酒。这时，他瞥见了炉旁站着个小伙子（是方才走进厨 房的），小伙子也同样殷切地朝他望着。巴特里奇忽然掉过身来对琼斯嚷 道："先生，咱们祝贺一下吧，这回喝一杯还不够呢。瞧，又有苏菲亚小姐 进城的新消息啦。站在炉旁的那个小伙子就正是给她领过路的人。我敢发 誓，他脸上贴的那副膏药还是我的呢。""上帝祝福您，先生，"那小伙子嚷 道，"这正是您的膏药。我永远也不会忘记您的好处，因为它差不多把我的 伤口治好啦。”
听到这话，琼斯从椅子一跃而起，吩咐小伙子立刻跟他离开厨房到一 个单间去。琼斯对有关苏菲亚的事总是如此精细，决不肯当着这么多人提 到她的名字。诚然，由于情不自禁，他曾在他认为决不会晓得她的那些军 官当中遥遥向苏菲亚祝过酒，然而即使那回，读者也会记得他是在怎样万 不得已的情况下才说出她姓什么来的。
说来真是不幸一一许多贤明的读者还会觉得十分荒谬怪诞：琼斯实在 非常懂得温存体贴，而他眼下的遭遇主要却是由于人家认为他缺乏这种温 存体贴――因为苏菲亚以为（也并非没有充分理由）琼斯任意同旁人说出 她的姓名同人品，比他在目前情况下还随便跟旁的女人胡闹更为可恼。老 实说，倘若苏菲亚不是认为琼斯曾两度在这方面行为失检，对她缺乏尊 敬，与一个高贵文雅的人所应有的情感十分不相称，那么凭昂诺尔怎么劝 阻，她也决不会不跟琼斯见见面就离开厄普顿的。
既然事情已弄到这个地步，我只好照样叙述；如果读者觉得有违常 理，感到吃惊，我也别无办法。我必须提醒这样的读者，我在这里写的是 历史，而不是讲一套理论，不必事事都符合大家通常所接受的有关真理与
自然的概念。即使做到这一点是再容易不过的事，我看，为了慎重起见， 我也最好避免那样。譬如眼前这件事，我未加评论地把它陈述出来。乍一 看，有些读者可能很不以为然；可是经过一番深思熟虑，大家也许就会感 到满意：明智而善良的人会把琼斯在厄普顿的遭遇看作是他乱搞女人这种 恶行的正当惩罚，一个立即产生的后果。愚蠢而邪恶的人心里也可以得到 一种安慰，认为人的名声与其说是决定于品德，还不如说是决定于偶然事 件。我们打算在这里阐发的感想也许与以上两种看法都背道而驰。我们想 说明这些偶然事件只不过证实了那个伟大、有益而又不同寻常的论点一一 整个这部作品的主旨也正在于宣扬这一论点。不过，也不要翻来覆去地去 重复，像一个普通的牧师讲道的时候，每讲完一段就重复一遍经文那样， 让它充斥全书。
我们只想说，不论苏菲亚多么可悲地冤枉了琼斯，她这么做看来是有 充分理由的；因为我相信，任何一位小姐处在她那种情况下，都会同样冤 枉对方。甚至可以说，倘若她的情人刚刚离开酒店她就走进来，她会发现 酒店老板和厄普顿那个女茶房一样知道她的姓名和容貌。因为当琼斯在里 间低声盘问苏菲亚那个向导的时候，素来不知分寸的巴特里奇却在厨房里 当着大家对费兹帕特利太太的那个向导盘问起来。酒店老板每遇这种场 合，总是偷听得很起劲。因此，关于苏菲亚的坠马、她被客栈误当作珍妮• 加美隆以及潘趣酒惹来的种种事端，总之，在我们把两位女客送上六马高 车以前所有在那家客栈里发生的事，酒店老板几乎统统都晓得了。
第九章
一些零星的观察而已
琼斯走开了整整半个钟头才又匆匆回到厨房，要老板马上把他应付的 账结清。巴特里奇本来会由于不得不离开这家客栈温暖的炉边和一杯美酒 而难过的，可是听说这回用不着步行，他心里多少得到些安慰。琼斯靠金 钱的力量，终于说服那个小伙子把他们送到他领苏菲亚前去的那家客栈； 但小伙子有一个条件，就是另外那个向导必须在酒店里等着他。原来厄普 顿和格洛斯特这两个客栈的老板彼此很熟，他恐怕格洛斯特客栈的老板有 一天会晓得向导曾把马又租给另外一个客人，那么一来，这个机灵小伙子 打算塞进自己腰包里的钱，就只好如数交出去了。
尽管下面这段情节看来很琐碎，我们还是得提一提，因为这件事使琼 斯先生迟延了好一阵才动身。原来另外那个向导极为诚实，也就是说，代 价要得极大；倘若不是亏了巴特里奇这个精明家伙巧妙地额外添上半个克 朗，指定这笔钱只许在等候的时候花在酒店里，琼斯给敲的竹杠还要更多 呢。酒店老板一听说有这么一笔钱可赚，立刻就使出全部口才竭力劝说， 那小伙子很快就被说服了，他又索取了半个克朗，同意留在酒店里等候。 这里，我们不得不指出：在下层社会里也有不少须用手腕的地方。大人物 往往自以为在欺诈方面本领多么高强，其实，有些地位低贱的人时常会胜 过他们。
马备好了，琼斯立刻跳上了亲爱的苏菲亚坐过的侧鞍。小伙子本来请 他骑在正鞍上，可是他选中了侧鞍，也许因为软和些。尽管巴特里奇跟琼 斯一样文弱，可是他觉得坐在侧鞍上实在有损男子汉的尊严，所以他接受 了小伙子的邀请，坐上了正鞍。这样，琼斯坐上了苏菲亚坐过的侧鞍，向 导坐在昂诺尔大姐坐过的侧鞍上，巴特里奇骑着第三匹马，一同上了路。 不到四小时他们就来到读者已经逗留过很久的那家客栈。巴特里奇一路上 都很兴奋，不断地告诉琼斯最近他得到的一些吉兆，预示他将要交好运 道；读者虽然一点儿也不迷信，必然也承认情况确乎看来很吉利。此外， 巴特里奇对琼斯不再去追求荣誉，转而追求苏菲亚也颇为高兴。这些兆头 都预示着这位塾师必将时来运转了。同时，他这也是初次才弄清楚了琼斯 与苏菲亚之间的爱情。以前，他几乎没注意这个方面，因为他从一开头就 猜错了琼斯离家出走的缘由。至于在厄普顿发生的事，他在离开那里的前
后过于惊慌了，没来得及仔细考虑，只认定可怜的琼斯是个地地道道的疯 子。这与他以前的想法刚好吻合。他原来就认为琼斯十分狂悖，而他猝然 离开格洛斯特时的情景也证实了这一点。可是巴特里奇对当前他们走的这 段路程很满意，因此，他对琼斯的神志清醒的程度也估计得高多了。
他们到达的时候，钟正好鸣三下。琼斯立刻去雇驿马。不幸，镇上到 处都雇不着马。读者如果想到这时全国正动荡不安，尤其这一带，双方正 在交手，整天整夜没有一个时辰不跑过军队的信使，这情况也就不足为奇 了。
琼斯想尽办法求那个向导把他们领到考文垂［24］，可是怎么说他也不肯。 正当琼斯跟那小伙子在客栈的庭院里交谈的时候，有个人走到他跟前来， 叫着他的名字打招呼，问他萨默塞特郡的府上可好。琼斯瞅了瞅这人，才 认出是在格洛斯特跟他同桌吃过饭的律师道林先生，于是很客气地还了 礼。
道林竭力劝琼斯先生当晚不要再往前走了。他举了许多无可反驳的理 由，譬如天快黑啦，路上净是烂泥，白天走方便多了，以及其他同样响亮 的理由；有些理由琼斯本人可能也想到过，可是不能使他改变主意，现在 也仍然无效。他照旧坚持原来的计划，即使徒步，也非走不可。
当好心的律师看出无法劝琼斯留下来的时候，他又死乞白赖说服那个 向导陪琼斯去。他提出许多动机，诱使向导走这不长的一段路程。最后 说："难道你以为这位先生不会好好酬谢你吗？ ”
不光是踢足球，在一切场合二对一总是要占上风的。在劝说或央求什 么的时候，一个细心的旁观者很可以看出联合力量的优势。他一定常常见 到一个做父亲、家主、妻子或旁的掌握权柄的人坚决拒绝一个人根据任何 理由提出的要求，后来只要有第二个或第三个人出来帮腔，不需要提出什 么新的理由，那人就会让步了。也许因而才有对一个论据或提议表示附议 一词，以及它在大会辩论时所起的巨大作用。同样，我们在法庭上时常听 到一位饱学之士（一般总是一位高等律师）花上整整一个钟头来重复另一 位饱学之士刚刚说过的话。
我们不去说明其中道理何在，只按照我们一向的办法，拿那个小伙子 的举动来作个例子：他接受了道林先生的劝说，答应让琼斯重新坐上那个 侧鞍。可是他坚持动身以前一定得好好喂喂可怜的牲口，说它们跑了好长 一程路，已很吃力了。其实，小伙子这种顾虑是多余的。尽管琼斯心情迫
切，急于动身，他也一定会亲自吩咐把马喂足了才走的，因为他向来不同 意只不过把动物当作机械看待的那种观点；当那种人用马刺踢马肚子时， 他会以为在感觉痛苦的能力上，马和马刺是相等的。
当马吃着小麦的时候，或者说当我们假定马在吃着小麦的时候（因为 那小伙子正在厨房里照料着自己，而客栈老板则在马厩里照料着让马别消 耗了他的小麦），琼斯先生在道林先生的挚意敦请下，走进他的房间，他 们一道饮起酒来。
第十章
琼斯先生和道林先生共饮
道林先生斟满一杯酒，提出祝可敬的奥尔华绥乡绅健康，接着又 说："要是您高兴的话，咱们也祝那位年轻的乡绅，他的外甥兼继承人的健 康。好，先生，就祝布利非先生，那位漂亮少爷的健康。我敢说，他将来 在这一带一定会成为一个了不起的人物。我心目中已经替他安排了一个选 区。”
"先生，”琼斯回答说，"我相信您不是存心要冒犯我，所以我也不见 怪。可是我告诉您，把这两个人相提并论是十分不妥当的，因为一个是人 类的光荣，另一个是个有辱人这个名称的坏蛋。”
道林听了一愣。他说，他本来以为两位先生的人品都是异常高尚 的。"至于奥尔华绥乡绅本人，"他说，"我还无缘拜识。可是到处都在谈论 他的仁义之风。那位少爷我也只见过一面，就是我把他母亲去世的消息带 给他的那次。当时我正有许多事要办，忙得不可开交，简直来不及和他谈 谈话。不过，看来他像个十分正派的绅士，举止文雅，我敢说，生平还没 见过更使我喜欢的上流人。”
"匆匆见一面他就把您迷住，这我一点也不觉得奇怪，”琼斯回答 说，"因为他跟魔鬼一般狡猾，就是多年和他住在一起也不一定看得出他的 真面目。我是从婴儿时候起和他一道长大的，几乎从来没分离过，可是他 有多么恶毒阴险，直到最近我才发现了一半。坦率地说，我向来不大喜欢 他。我认为他身上缺乏那种慷慨大方的气度，而那是人类一切伟大崇高的 品质真正的基础。很早以前我就在他身上看到我所最鄙视的自私自利的性 格，可是直到最近我才发现他能干出多么卑鄙下流的勾当。我终于发现他 利用我生性坦率，处心积虑地布置了一连串的阴谋诡计来陷害我，最后他 总算达到目的了。”
"咳，咳，”道林嚷道，"让这样一个人来继承令舅奥尔华绥乡绅那么大 一片田产，那可未免太不幸啦。”
"唉，先生，"琼斯大声说，"您这是加于我一份我不配享有的光荣。不 错，承他好心，曾经准许我用比这更要亲近得多的名字称呼他。可是这只 是出于他自愿的善行，如今他取消了我这份荣誉，我不能埋怨他不公道， 因为早先我本来也没资格享受。我可以确实告诉您，我并不是奥尔华绥先
生的什么亲属。倘若世上那些对他的高风亮节缺乏真正认识的人看到他对 我的举动贸然认为他苛待亲属，那就大大冤枉了最好的一个人，因为 我……不过，对不起，我就不用跟您啰嗦我自己的事了。既然您好像认为 我是奥尔华绥先生的亲属，我理应把您纠正过来，免得以后有人责怪他老 人家。请您相信，我宁可舍掉性命也不愿使他被人误解。”
"先生，"道林大声说，"听您这番话，您确实像一位很懂得道义的人。 可是我不但不会嫌您啰嗦，并且还很高兴知道，假如您不是奥尔华绥先生 的什么亲属，何以大家都把您看作他的亲属。半个钟头以内，您的马还不 会备好。估计时间还来得及，希望您把经过对我讲一讲。我的确感到十分 奇怪，您既然不是那位乡绅的亲属，怎么大家会认为您是呢。”
就性情随和（不是就举止审慎）而言，琼斯与可爱的苏菲亚确实有些 相像。经道林先生这么一怂恿，琼斯马上满足他的好奇心，开始叙述自己 的身世和教养，正像奥瑟罗那样：
从他的孩提时代起，
直到他被嘱讲述的那一刻。丝］
而道林听的时候，就像苔丝狄蒙娜那样聚精会神:
他发誓说，奇异，真奇异，
悲惨啊，太悲惨了。丝
道林先生听了这段叙述，大为感动；他虽然身为律师，倒也不曾灭绝 人性。其实，世上最不公平的事，莫过于把我们对一种职业的偏见应用到 某一成员的私生活上去，用我们对他所从事的职务的看法来看他本人。诚 然，某些由于职业的需要而干出的事，因为习以为常，也就不觉得可怕 了。但在所有其他方面，各行各业的人都仍然受天性的支配；甚至也许可 以说，在一个人出于日常工作的需要，暂时把天性放在一边的时候，它的 作用可能还来得更强烈一些。一个屠夫在下手宰杀一匹良马时，毫无疑问 会感到惋惜。外科医生尽管为病者截肢自己并不感到痛苦，可是我晓得遇 上患痛风症的人，他也会起怜悯之心。砍过几百颗头颅的刽子手，据说头
回动手时不免也会颤抖。甚至那些以杀戮为职业的人，虽然正打仗时杀人 无数，不但杀他们的同行，也毫不在乎地残害妇孺；可是在战鼓不鸣、号 角不响的太平年月里，连这样的人也会放下他们所有的凶暴，在文雅的社 会里变得很温和。同样，一个律师也会同情另一个人的痛苦遭遇，只要那 人不是他的主顾的对手。
读者也晓得，琼斯一直对旁人在奥尔华绥先生面前把他描绘得多么卑 鄙下流，还毫无所知。谈到其他情况，他也没把自己说得怎么不对，因为 虽然他不肯去责怪曾经疼爱过他的恩人，可是他也并不想往自己身上揽一 大堆过错。因此，道林看出（而且也不无理由），背后一定有人大大陷害 了他。"乡绅决不会仅仅由于你犯了年轻人都可能犯的一些过失就取消你的 家产继承权，"道林大声说，"当然，我说取消继承权是不妥当的，因为根 据法律，您并没有继承权。在这一点上是没有官司可打的。可是既然乡绅 已经把您收为他的义子，即使您得不到他的全部财产，照理说也应得到相 当一部分。甚至您想得到他的全部财产，我也不能怪您，因为人人都是希 望得的越多越好，在这一点上没人能加以指责。”
"您确实误解了我，"琼斯说，"我从来也没考虑到奥尔华绥先生的财产 问题。给我多么少我也会满意的一一我甚至可以说，从来也没考虑过他能 够或者该当给我些什么。我可以严肃地这么说：倘使奥尔华绥先生待我比 布利非厚，我也会把这情况扭转过来。我宁愿做到自己心安理得，也不愿 享用旁人的财产。富丽堂皇的宅第、众多的奴仆、丰盛的筵席以及其他随 着财产而来的一切便利或排场所能带给人的那点微不足道的光彩，比起一 颗善良的心灵在考虑着慷慨、善良、高贵和仁慈行为时所享受到的恬适的 安宁、由衷的知足、惊心动魄的喜悦和兴高采烈的胜利感来，又算得了什 么呢？我既不会由于布利非将得到的财产而嫉妒他，也不会由于他目前拥 有的财产而眼红。我相信布利非先生确乎以为我怀着您提到的那种念头。 我认为正是这种出自他那肮脏心灵里的疑惧，促使他用那么卑劣的手段来 对付我。可是谢天谢地，我问心无愧。朋友，不管用什么来同我换这种心 安理得，我也不肯的。只要我一天清楚自己没损害过谁（或者甚至没动过 这种念头），那么我就：
Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis Arbor estiva recreatur aura,
Quod latus mundi nebula, malusque
Jupiter urget.
Pone sub curru nimium propinqui
Solis in terra domibus negata ；
Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo,
Dulce loquentem.［27］
尽可把我放到夏日的和风
吹不松土块也吹不暖树丛的地方，
乌云愈益低垂，
愤怒的朱庇特使凛冽的四季变了样。
尽可把我放在骄阳下，
白昼的车轮疾驶，
拉拉芝［28］的眉语目笑， 使我辛劳时心旷神怡。
――弗兰西斯先生［四
说完之后，他斟满一杯酒，一饮而尽，祝诗里那位可爱的拉拉芝小姐 健康。然后，他又把道林的杯子斟满，一定要他也祝酒。"好吧，"道林大 声说，"那么我就衷心祝拉拉芝小姐健康，"道林嚷道，"我虽然没见过她， 可常听人向她祝酒。他们说她长得很漂亮呢。”
尽管道林所没能领会的不仅仅是谈话中的拉丁文部分，但其中有些东 西看来给了他很深的印象。虽然他尽量用眨眼、点头、龇牙、抿嘴在琼斯 面前掩盖自己的这种印象（因为我们不论想得对还是不对，往往感到不好 意思），然而他肯定正暗暗对他所领会到的情感深表赞许，并且对琼斯确 实十分同情。不过也许我们等另外有机会再来评论这一点吧，特别是，如 果道林先生还会在书中再次出现的话。眼下，我们只好匆匆与这位先生告 别，正像琼斯先生一听巴特里奇说马已备好，立刻就付了酒账，告别了这 位朋友，跨上马一样。虽然天黑了，而且开始下起大雨，他也仍开始朝考 文垂进发。
第十一章
琼斯赴考文垂途中遇到的灾难，以及巴特里奇的金玉良喜
再没有比从他们动身的地方到考文垂之间更坦直的路了。尽管不论琼 斯、巴特里奇还是那个向导都没走过这条路，如果不是上一章煞尾时提到 的两个原因，他们决不会迷失方向的。
不幸的是，这两种情况同时发生了，于是就把我们的旅客引到一条很 少人走过的幽径上去。骑了六哩路，并没来到考文垂教堂的巍峨尖塔跟 前，却仍然挣扎在一条泥泞不堪的小路上，丝毫也看不出大城市近郊的迹 象。
如今琼斯说他们一定是迷路了，可是向导说那是不可能的；在日常谈 话中，"不可能”不仅经常表示不大会发生，有时候甚至指已经发生了的 事。"无限”和"永恒”这两个词儿时常也有人这么夸大滥用。前者往往指半 码之远，后者往往指五分钟之久。因此，把已经丢掉的东西说成是决无丢 失可能也就很平常了。事实上，当前正是这样。尽管那个向导把握十足地 矢口否认走错了路，然而他们走的决不是通往考文垂的路，正如一个狡 诈、贪婪、残酷、伪善的守财奴走的决不是通往天堂的路一样。
不曾在风雨交加的黑夜里迷过路的人也许想象不出那情景有多么可 怕：他们在凛冽的气候中挣扎的时候，心里还不能指望将有熊熊的炉火可 烤，干爽的衣服可换，或有什么东西可吃，用这种愉快的指望来鼓起勇 气。只要大家对这种可怕的情景略有所知，就足可以推想这时巴特里奇脑 子里都转些什么念头了。下面我们就来叙述一下。
琼斯越走越相信这条路错了。连向导最后也承认，他相信这不是通往 考文垂的路，尽管他同时还坚持说迷路是不可能的。可是巴特里奇另有一 种见解。他说从刚一动身他就料想到会出点岔子。"您上马的时候没理会站 在门口的那个老妇人吗？”他对琼斯说，"可惜您没赏她几个钱，真可惜！ 因为她当时说您会后悔的；她这话一出口，就下起雨来了，从那时候起， 风越刮越大。不管有些人怎么看，我相信巫婆是能随时呼风唤雨的。这种 事儿我见过好多次了。假使我这辈子遇见过巫婆，她确实就是一个。我当 时就是这么想的。倘若我口袋里有半个便士的话，也一定会丢给她的。说 真的，对这种人总是施舍点好，不然的话谁晓得会出什么乱子！许多人为 了省半个便士，却丢掉了牲口呢。”
尽管琼斯因为走错路耽搁了行程而感到十分懊恼，可是对巴特里奇这 些迷信说法仍然忍不住笑了。这时，又发生了一件事，越发大大加强了巴 特里奇的那种说法：他从马上栽了下来，可是除了衣服上沾些泥土之外， 倒没受什么伤。
巴特里奇一从地上站起来，立刻就用这一跤作为他刚才发表的那些看 法的铁证。可是琼斯发现他并没摔伤，就笑了笑回答说："巴特里奇，你那 个巫婆真是个无情无义的贱货，她发起脾气原来不分冤家还是朋友。要是 那个老婆子因为我怠慢了她，生我的气，你对她尊崇得那么五体投地，她 干吗却偏偏把你从马上栽下来？ ”
"拿会施妖术的人开玩笑可不好，"巴特里奇大声说，"她们往往是很毒 辣的。我记得一个兽医惹恼了一个巫婆，因为他问那巫婆魔鬼替她撑腰的 期限什么时候满。不到三个月，他最好的一头奶牛淹死了。这样她还不解 恨，过不久又让他损失了一桶最好的酒。原来就在他刚开桶和几个邻舍畅 饮的那个晚上，巫婆拔开了塞子，酒洒了个满窖。一句话，得罪了巫婆以 后他就再也没好日子过了。巫婆把这个可怜的人折磨得喝起酒来。不上一 两年，他的牲口全不归他所有了，目前他和他一家人只好依靠教区的赒济 过活。”
那个向导，也许连他的马，全聚精会神地听着巴特里奇这番高论，这 时不知是由于疏忽大意还是由于巫婆使的坏，连人带马跌到烂泥里去了。
巴特里奇把这一跤跟他自己跌的那一跤都归咎于同样的原因。他对琼 斯先生说，下回准该轮到他了。他恳切央求琼斯回去找到那个老妇人，让 她消消气。"咱们很快就要到达客栈了，"他又说，"因为尽管咱们好像是在 朝前走，其实，我看咱们准是还停留在一小时以前呆的那个地方。我还敢 发誓，要是在白天的话，眼下还可以望到咱们打那里出发的那家客栈呢。”
琼斯对这番金玉良言没作可否，他一心一意只关心着那个向导跌伤了 没有。他这一跤跌得并不比巴特里奇刚才那次更重。多年来他的衣服脏惯 了，非常耐脏。他立刻就坐回侧鞍上，朝他的那匹马狠狠骂了几声，还打 了它几下，因而琼斯先生很快就晓得他并没受什么伤，也就放下了心。
第十二章
琼斯先生不听巴特里奇的劝阻，继续前进，以及他们在路上所遇到 的事情
这时，他们远远望见一道灯光。琼斯高兴极了，可是巴特里奇却十分 害怕。他坚决认为自己中了巫婆的妖术，而那灯光是鬼火或者比鬼火更加 危险的东西。
可是当他们走近那灯光（或者照现在看来是那些灯光）的时候，巴特 里奇更加害怕了。他们听到一片嘈杂的人声，有唱，有笑，也有喊叫的声 音，还有好像发自某种乐器的怪声，可又实在无法称之为音乐。其实，稍 稍迁就一下巴特里奇的说法，也可以叫作中了妖术的音乐吧！
简直再也想象不出什么恐怖能够超过巴特里奇此刻所感到的了，连在 旁仔细听着的那个驿夫也受到感染。因此，他也跟巴特里奇一道来央求琼 斯转回去，说他对巴特里奇刚才说的话深信不疑：尽管他们好像是在朝前 走着，可是至少这半个小时没移动一步。
在懊恼的心情中，琼斯看到这两个可怜家伙吓成那样子，也禁不住笑 了。"不是咱们朝那些灯光走，"琼斯说，"就是那些灯光在朝咱们走来。反 正现在离灯光已经不远了。看来这簇人只不过在寻欢作乐，你们两个有什 么可怕的？"
"寻欢作乐，先生！"巴特里奇大声说，"谁会在这么深更半夜的时候， 在这种地方，在这种天气里寻欢作乐？准是鬼，要不就是巫婆，再不就是 妖精，不会是旁的。”
"管他们是什么呢，"琼斯大声说，"横竖我也要过去向他们打听去考文 垂的路。巴特里奇，并不是所有巫婆都像咱们先前不幸遇上的那个一样恶 毒的。”
"啊，我的天！先生，"巴特里奇嚷道，"谁也拿不准她们的脾气。最好 还是跟她们客客气气的。咱们要是碰上比巫婆更可怕的东西，甚至撞上魔 鬼，那可怎么好呢？……先生，请您听我的劝告吧，听听吧。关于这类事 情，如果您读过我曾读过的那么多可怕的描写，您就决不会这么天不怕地 不怕啦。……天哪，这是什么地方呀？咱们这是朝哪里走呀？人世间从来 也没这么漆黑过，我想就是阴间也不会比这更黑吧。”
琼斯对这些暗示和忠告一概置之不理，只管催马前进。可怜的巴特里 奇只好紧紧跟随，因为他虽然没有勇气走到前头去，也更不敢独自落在后 边。
他们终于来到那个闪着灯光，发出各种声响的地方。琼斯一看，原来 只是一座谷仓，里面聚集着一大群男男女女，个个面带喜容，正在一道玩 耍。
琼斯刚一在谷仓敞开着的大门口出现，里面就有个男人粗声粗气地问 道：什么人？琼斯回答说，是个朋友。接着就跟他打听往考文垂去的路。
"你要真是个朋友的话，"谷仓里另一个男人嚷道，"那么最好就下马来 避避，等这阵暴雨过去再走。"（这时，雨确实越下越大了。）"欢迎你把 马拉进来，谷仓那头有空地方。”
"您真是太客气啦，"琼斯回答说，"我就领您的盛情，在这儿躲一会儿 雨吧。另外还有两个人也很愿意借借光。"主人答应得倒比借光的人还要热 烈，因为巴特里奇宁愿忍受风雨的无情折磨，也不肯去信赖他认为是妖魔 鬼怪表现的仁慈，而那个可怜的向导也早已受到巴特里奇的感染，同样害 怕起来。但是他们却又不得不跟琼斯一道进去：因为向导不敢离开他的 马，巴特里奇则最怕独自呆在外面。
倘若这部历史是写于迷信盛行的年代，我就会出于同情，决不让读者 老是捉摸不定，而干脆告诉他鬼王别西卜四或魔鬼是不是确实带领它的全部 地狱里的随从亲自出现了。但是既然这种邪说早已过时，很少人还去相 信，我也就不必担心会引起什么恐怖了。老实说，地狱那套道具早就成了 戏院老板的私产，近来似乎被当作废物堆到一旁，只能去吓唬顶层楼座的 观众了，我们的读者谅必没有几个会坐到那里去的。
尽管我们并不担心上述这段情节会引起读者什么恐怖，可是我们有理 由担心会引起读者另外一种顾虑：就怕把大家引入神仙世界去，把一些虽 然没有人会幼稚到信以为真，而许多人却愚蠢到花时间去描写或阅读的离 奇人物搬上这部历史。我们决不会背信弃义这样做的。
我们曾公开宣布过只从自然提取素材，为了防止人们产生这种对一位 历史家的声誉十分有害的怀疑，下面我们就来说说这是些什么人，为什么 他们的突然出现会吓得巴特里奇魂不附体，那向导也吓得不轻，连琼斯先 生本人也有些吃惊了。
聚集在谷仓里的只是一些埃及人，俗名吉卜赛人也]。这时，他们正在庆 祝一个伙伴的婚礼。
聚在这里的人们是再快活不过了。每张面孔都喜气洋洋，他们的舞会 进行得有条不紊，合乎体统，也许比个乡村舞会还强一些，因为这些人都 属于一个正式的政府，定有自己的法律，人人都服从一位他们称作国王的 首脑。
在吃食上，任何地方也比不上这谷仓现在所提供的那么丰富。这里固 然没有珍馐美味，客人的好胃口也不需要那些。谷仓里有的是腊肉、鸡鸭 和羊肉。聚在这里的每位客人又亲自调味，他们的手艺胜过法国有名的厨 师。我们这位主人公此刻在谷仓里所感到的惊愕，决不下于伊尼亚在朱诺 庙里
Dum stupet obtutuque h^ret defixus in uno, [32]
的那段描写。正当他莫名其妙地四下张望时，一位可敬的老人朝他走来， 连连对他友好地致意，态度亲切而不拘礼仪。原来这位就是吉卜赛人的国 王。他的衣着和他统治的平民没什么区别，也不靠王室一套排场来维持他 的尊严。然而在他的神态中（正像琼斯先生说的）似乎有一种威望，使人 见了立即产生敬畏之感的威严。这一切也许仅仅是出自琼斯先生的幻想， 实际上这种感觉大概是随着权威而来，它和权威是分不开的。
琼斯那坦率的神情和文雅的举止，再加上俊秀的相貌，使每个初次见 面的人都立刻大大发生好感。当前，琼斯的风度和仪表也许更加显著了， 因为一晓得来到他跟前的是吉卜赛人的国王，他就深深表示了敬意；除了 这位国王自己的子民而外，很少有人给予他这样的崇敬，所以他越发感到 吉\\/ 何兴。
于是，吉卜赛王吩咐摆起一张桌子，端上最丰美的菜肴来款待贵宾。 国王陛下在我们这位主人公的右首坐下，然后就对他这样谈起来：
"我相信先生常看见我的臣民，就是你们所谓的流浪人，因为他们到处 跑。但是我想您也许料不到我们是这么多的人，要是别人说我们吉卜赛人 跟地球上任何民族同样有秩序，治理得很好，您也许还会更为吃惊。
"我荣幸担任他们的国王，我敢说天下再没有比我的百姓更恭顺、更懂 爱戴的人民。我配不配受到那样的爱戴，我不能说；不过我敢说我的一切 计划都是为了造福他们。当然这也不值得去夸耀，因为这些百姓整天奔 走，总把最好的东西拿给我，除了造福他们，我还能做什么？他们爱我敬 我，乃因我爱他们，眷顾他们。这是唯一的原因，我不知有旁的。
"大约在一两千年以前（我说不准确，因为我不认字，也不会写），吉 卜赛人中间发生了一次你们所谓的大革命。那时候还有吉卜赛贵族，那些 贵族成天为了领土你争我夺。但是吉卜赛王把他们都消灭了，使百姓彼此 一律平等。从那以后他们再也不争吵了，因为他们都不想当国王，他们当 老百姓更舒服些；我可以告诉先生，当国王很麻烦，成天得判官司，每当 我不得不惩罚我的亲戚挚友时，就但愿当个普通的吉卜赛人。我们虽然不 判死刑，可是吉卜赛的刑法严厉得很。它使受罚的人自己感到耻辱，那才 是最可怕的惩罚。还没有一个吉卜赛人受罚后又重犯过。"㈤
说到这里，国王对于别的政府并没以耻辱作为惩罚的办法，表示诧 异。琼斯告诉他事实并非如此，因为根据英国的法律，许多种犯罪行为都 是用耻辱来惩罚的，而耻辱也正是一切惩罚的后果。"这倒很奇怪，"国王 说，"我虽然没同英国人在一道生活过，但也常听人传说并知道你们的一些 情况。我常听人说耻辱往往也是你们奖赏的原因和结果。赏与罚在贵国是 —回事吗？”
正当国王陛下这样和琼斯交谈着的时候，谷仓里突然起了一片吵嚷 声。原来巴特里奇看见吉卜赛人这样彬彬有礼，心里就不再那么害怕了。 在吉卜赛人的劝请下，他不但饱餐了他们的菜肴，也品尝了他们的酒。这 酒一喝下去，不但使他的畏惧之感荡然无存，而且还引来一种飘飘然之 感。
一个聪明而并不特别漂亮的吉卜赛少妇以替他算命为名，把这个老实 汉子诱到一旁。当他们两个独自来到谷仓的一个僻静角落时，不知是由于 酒力的强烈（在人微倦之后，酒最能激起情欲了）还是因为那位吉卜赛妇 人把作女人的端庄体面全抛掉了，总之，她明显地使出种种媚术来诱惑年 轻的巴特里奇。吉卜赛妇人的丈夫发现他们行为不端，由于吃醋，就一直 盯着他的妻子，尾随着她。终于当吉卜赛女人倒在这位情夫怀里的时候， 被那丈夫当场捉住了。
这真叫琼斯狼狈不堪。巴特里奇被解到国王跟前来。国王先听取了原 告的控诉，然后也听取了犯人的申辩。其实，巴特里奇并没说出什么道理 来。这个可怜的家伙由于罪证确凿，心慌意乱，根本没什么可以替自己申 辩的。于是，国王陛下转过来对琼斯说："先生，您听到了他们的话。您看 该怎样来惩罚你手下这个人?”
琼斯对这件事表示了歉意。他说巴特里奇应尽力赔偿那丈夫的损失， 说他身边带的钱不多，掏了一下衣袋，就递给那男人一个基尼。那男人立 刻说，希望老爷至少也得给他五个基尼。
经过一番磋商，这数目最后减到两个基尼。琼斯在对那男人讲明他得 到赔偿后必须宽恕巴特里奇和他自己的妻子，并正要交钱的时候，国王把 他拦住了。国王问那个证人是在什么时候发现那两个罪犯的，他回答说自 从那个妇人一跟陌生人交谈，她丈夫就关照他监视他们，并且说在抓住他 们的犯罪行为之前，始终都盯着他们。然后国王又问那男人是不是一直躲 在暗处跟他一道偷看，那男人作了肯定的答复。这时，吉卜赛国王就对那 个做丈夫的说："我看到竟有吉卜赛人为了钱而出卖老婆的名声，我很难 过。倘若你爱自己的老婆，就应当不让这种事发生，而不是听任老婆当婊 子，你好去捉奸。不许你接受一个钱，你应受的不是奖赏，而是惩罚。我 现在宣布你是个无耻的吉卜赛人，判你戴一个月绿帽子，一个月内，大家 都可以指着你的老婆喊婊子，因为你是个无耻的吉卜赛汉子，她也同样是 个无耻的婊子。”
吉卜赛人马上执行这命令去了，只留下琼斯、巴特里奇和国王陛下在 一起。
琼斯大大称赞了这个公正的判决，国王转过身来对他说："我相信先生 一定会很吃惊。您谅必把我的百姓想得很坏，以为他们全是些小偷。”
"先生，我不得不承认，"琼斯说，"我从没听到谁夸奖过他们，而他们 好像是应受到夸奖的。”
"我来告诉您咱们两个民族的区别吧，"国王说，"我的人民抢你们，你 们则自己互相抢。”
从那以后，琼斯一直郑重地称颂在这样一位首脑治理下的百姓有多么 幸福。
老实说，他们的幸福看来是如此完美，因而使我们担心有一些主张赋 予主政者以无限权力的人会以此为范例，说这是一切政体中最好的政体。
这里，我们将出乎人们意料之外地承认一点：任何职权有限的政府都 不可能像这个吉卜赛王国治理得如此完美，为民众造福如此之多。人类最 幸福的时候便是绝大部分已知世界由一个君主统治着的时候，这个太平盛 世一直延续到五王醐时代，那才真正是黄金时代，也是人类从伊甸园被逐出 以后直到今天，不是在诗人丰富的想象中、而是实际存在过的唯一的黄金 时代。
其实，据我所知，只有一个反对君主专制的理由是站得住脚的。这种 政体本身的结构原是极好的，唯一的缺陷好像是很难找到配担任专制君主 这一职位的人。要胜任这一职位，必须具备三种品质，而历史证明这三种 品质都很难在人君身上找到：第一，为人君的必须知道有所节制，能满足 于可以拥有的权力；第二，必须有足够的智慧，能知道自己的幸福何在； 第三，心地必须足够仁慈，能够维护旁人的幸福，不但使自己的幸福与旁 人的幸福并存，并且还要使旁人的幸福有助于促进自己的幸福。
假定真有一位具备了所有这些重大而罕见的条件的专制君主，能够为 社会谋极大的福利，我们当然应该赋予他这种权柄。反之，对于一个缺乏 这些条件的人，若给予他这种专制权，那就很可能会为社会带来极大的灾 难。
简单地说，对于君主专制可能带来的祸与福，我们从我们的宗教中也 可以有所体会。天堂与地狱的写照在我们眼前为二者摆出了生动的形象。 尽管地狱之王的权力完全得之于天堂的万能之主，然而从经文来看，魔王 显然已经得到了在地狱范围以内的绝对统治权。根据经文，地狱之王从天 堂所能取得的只有这一种权力。因此，倘若地上的暴君要证明他们享有天 赋的神权，那必然是间接得自地狱之王的。这些人必是魔王派遣来的，因 为他们身上显著地带着那位魔王的特征。
总之，一切时代的历史都表明：人们急于抓权只是为了做坏事，当他 们一旦掌权之后，也只会用它来做坏事。因此，贸然去改变政体，那是十 分不慎重的，因为在一千个足以使我们心惊胆战的暴君中，只能勉强希望 有两三个例外。在这种情形下，我看明智得多的办法还是宁可忍受那木石 一般的法律所产生的不便，也不要去依赖一个专制暴君肯于倾听下情的耳 朵来加以矫正。
尽管吉卜赛人也许在这样的政府下已经享受了长时期的幸福，然而他 们的榜样仍是不足为训的。他们所以能过得那样幸福，也许完全由于他们
和其他民族有一点不同：他们之间没有虚伪的荣誉，而且他们把耻辱当作 世上最严峻的惩罚。
第十三章
琼斯与巴特里奇之间的谈话
衷心热爱自由的人们一定会原谅我们在上一章煞尾处扯的一大段闲 话。那是为了防止有人利用我们这部历史去证明那些邪恶无耻的教士所宣 扬的最为有害的主张。
我们现在再来谈琼斯先生。暴雨过后，他就辞别吉卜赛国王，深深感 谢他的谦恭举止和殷勤款待，向考文垂进发。因为这时天色还没亮，国王 派了一个吉卜赛人为他们引路。
由于走错了路，六哩的路程琼斯却走了+—哩，其中又大半都是些连 去请接生婆的人也无法快走的讨厌的道路。他们直到半夜快十二点才走到 考文垂；而且到两点多才雇上马，因为驿马这时很不容易雇到。那个驿夫 兼向导又一点不像琼斯那么急于动身，而宁愿仿效巴特里奇那种悠闲自在 的气质。巴特里奇由于没得到睡眠这份营养，就尽量用其他各种营养来补 偿。每逢来到一家客栈，他就再高兴不过了。等到不得不离开的时候，他 又总是十分垂头丧气。
琼斯这时快马加鞭，因此，我们也根据一向的做法，并遵照朗吉努斯四 所确定的原则，一路跟踪他。他从考文垂来到达文垂，又从那里到达斯特 拉特福。次日刚刚过午，就在苏菲亚离开几个钟头以后，他也来到邓斯特 布尔。在这里，他虽然不得不多停留一些时候，好让铁匠仔细给他要骑的 驿马钉上掌，他认为一定可以在苏菲亚到达圣奥尔本斯以前赶上她。他断 定（而且理由很充分）那位贵族将在那里停下来用饭。
倘若事情果然如他所料，他多半就在上述地点见到他的天使了。可是 不幸那位贵族已经吩咐在他伦敦的公馆里备饭，并且为了能按时到达，他 已派人在圣奥尔本斯准备下换乘的马。因此，琼斯到达的时候，人们告诉 他那辆六马高车在两小时以前就已出发了。
琼斯要是有旁的驿马可以换乘就好了，可是没有；因此，要在那辆马 车到达伦敦以前追上它显然是不可能的事了。这时，巴特里奇认为正好乘 机提醒他的朋友一件事一一这事看来琼斯早已忘得干干净净了。琼斯离开 那家酒馆以后（他在那里初次遇到苏菲亚的向导），仅仅吃过一个荷包 蛋，因为他在吉卜赛人的宴会上只顾长了一些见识罢了。读者晓得了这些 情况，大概就不难猜出巴特里奇提醒他的是什么了。
客栈老板完全赞成巴特里奇先生的意见。一听到巴特里奇劝琼斯留下 来打尖，他就赶忙插嘴，一方面撤回原来做下的可以立即把马备好的诺 言，另一方面又向琼斯先生担保准备饭菜不会耽搁时间，可以趁着把马从 草地上拉回来再喂一遍谷子的当儿就全准备好了。
主要由于客栈老板的这番话，琼斯终于被说服了。现在烤上了一块羊 腿。正做菜的当儿，巴特里奇跟他的主人（或者说朋友）一道被让进同一 个房间，他就这么滔滔不绝地讲开了：
"真的，先生，如果世上有一个男人配得上一位闺秀的话，您就配得上 苏菲亚•魏斯顿小姐；因为一个男子的爱情得要多么深厚，才能像您那样不 吃不喝，单靠相思过活呀！我敢说在过去的二十四个钟头里，我比您多吃 了三十倍的东西，可我还饿得要命。因为再没有比出门走路更叫人容易饿 的了，尤其在这种寒冷的天气里。可是我也说不上是什么缘故，您看来也 十分健康，而且从来也没见您这么精神抖擞过。一定是爱情滋润着您哪。”
"这是非常丰盛的宴席，巴特里奇，"琼斯回答说，"昨天我不是很走 运，又得到一份美味的点心吗？你难道不相信，靠那只可爱的皮夹子我能 够活上不止二十四个钟头吗?”
"当然，"巴特里奇大声说，"皮夹子里头的东西足够买上许多顿好饭。 您这运气来得很及时，此刻您自己的钱大概也快花光了吧！”
"你这是什么意思？"琼斯问道，"你可别以为我会干出那样不规矩的事 来！即便这钱不是魏斯顿小姐的，而是旁人的，我也不会一一”
"不规矩！"巴特里奇大声说，"老天决不允许我那么冤枉您。既然您日 后准能还上，眼下先借小姐的一点花花，这又算得了什么不规矩？不，我 当然是说您手头一宽绰，就一定尽早归还她。可是眼下您既然缺钱使，借 用一下又碍什么事！这钱要是个穷人的，那自是另一回事。可是像她这么 阔气的一位小姐，一定不会在乎，何况如今又有一位贵族陪着她，无论她 需要什么，那位贵族都一定会供给她的。再说即使她想要回一部分钱，她 也不能全要，所以我赞成给她一些。可是在我没捞到一笔钱之前，我宁可 给绞死，也不会提起拾到钞票的事，因为我听说伦敦这个地方，身上没钱 是最难活下去的。老实说，我要不是晓得皮夹子里的钞票是谁的，我还会 以为是魔鬼的，不敢动用呢。您既然晓得不是魔鬼的，而且又不是偷来摸 来的，那么在您最缺钱用的时候却拒绝动用它，那可就会惹恼命运女神， 以后恐怕您再也不会遇上这样的好运道了 ；因为fortuna nunquam
perpetuo est bona［约。尽管我这么说了，怎么办还是随您。至于我这方 面，就是绞死我，我也决不会说出一个字去的。”
“巴特里奇，”琼斯大声说，“在我看来,绞刑这行当non longe alienum a Scavoloe studiis四。”“您应该说alienus㈣，”巴特里奇 说，“我记得您引的这一段，在文法上是作为communis，alienus， immunis， variis casibus serviunt几个词尾变化不同的例证举出 的。""尽管你记得这一段，”琼斯大声说，"可是我认为你并不了解。朋 友，干脆用普通的英语告诉你吧，凡是拾到旁人的东西，晓得物主是谁而 故意吞没的，in foro conscientia四，就和偷窃一样，应该处以死刑。至 于这张钞票，是我最心爱的人的财产，她曾经保存过它，无论如何我非把 它交到她手里不可。不，即使我跟你一样饿，而且也没什么可以充饥。这 问题我希望在我睡觉之前能解决了；万一办不到，你也不许再提那个卑鄙 下流的想法，使我震惊；不然的话，你会永远让我厌恶的。”
"我要是也那么认为，刚才的话我也不会提了，"巴特里奇大声说，"因 为我跟旁人一样看不起卑鄙下流的事。这种事儿您大概比我更清楚。可是 我活了这么大岁数，教了这么多年书，决不会连fas et nefas驱都分不清 楚。不过咱们似乎都活一天学一天。我记得有一位上年纪的老师、一位渊 博的学者时常说：Polly matete cry town is my daskalon快他告诉我 们，这句话翻成英文就是：孩子有时候可以教他祖母怎样嘬鸡蛋。要是到 今天我才等人家教我文法，那我可就白活一辈子了。少爷，等您活到我这 岁数上，您也许会改变您的看法。记得当我还是个二十—二岁的小伙子的 时候，我也以为自己像今天这么明智。我一向总教学生念alienus，我的老 师也是这么教我的。”
巴特里奇能够惹恼琼斯的事并不很多，足以让巴特里奇这么急得忘掉 敬意的场合也寥寥无几。然而不幸这回一下全碰上了。前面我们已经看到 巴特里奇受不住人家攻击他不学无术，而他的某些话琼斯听了也按捺不住 了。这时，琼斯带着轻蔑鄙夷的神情（这在他倒是罕见的）嚷道："巴特里 奇，我看出你是个自以为了不起的老傻瓜，可我希望你别还是个老坏蛋。 我已经晓得你是个傻瓜了，老实说，如果我也准晓得你是个坏蛋的话，你 就不许再跟我一道走路了。”
这位贤明的塾师已经出了一通气，满足了，所以就像俗语所说的，立 即把脑袋缩到腔子里去了。他说要是他说了什么开罪琼斯的话，那决不是
有意的，他表示道歉。不过Nemo omnibus horis sapit。四
琼斯决不是那种冷酷无情的人，然而他有烈性人的弱点：他的朋友都 承认他有点太容易发火，同时，他的对头也承认他的脾气很快就会平息下 来。他完全不像海洋那样：暴风雨过后，浪头来得反而更加凶猛。看到巴 特里奇低头认错，琼斯也立刻软了下来，和他握手，带着和蔼可亲的神色 同他絮絮叨叨地谈着体己话儿，同时还严厉地责备着自己，虽然许多善良 的读者对他的责备要比那还要严厉一倍也不止。
巴特里奇这时大为放心了。他本来深怕开罪琼斯，现在这种担心已经 消失。同时，由于琼斯认了错，他的自尊心也得到了满足。他趁势又立刻 扯到主要把琼斯惹恼的那件事上，嘟嚷着说："当然，先生，在有些事情上 您知道得比我多，可是说到文法，那谁也没有我的知识丰富。我想至少在 这上头我是完全有把握的。”
如果还有什么东西能使这位塾师更加满意的话，那就是这时端上桌来 的一块热腾腾的上等羊肩肉。两人饱餐一顿之后，才又跨上马，朝伦敦进 发。
第十四章
琼斯先生离开圣奥尔本斯后途中遇到的事
他们走出巴尔涅特四两哩光景，这时，在暮色苍茫中，一个样子颇为文 雅却骑着一匹瘦马的人朝琼斯走来，问他是否去伦敦。琼斯作了肯定的答 复。于是，那个人说："如果您让我跟您一道走，我就感激不尽了。天已经 很晚了，这一带我不熟。"琼斯欣然答应了。他们就结伴而行，谈的不外乎 这种场合照例谈的一些话。
主要的话题是盗匪。那个陌生人谈起来颇有些担忧，可是琼斯说，他 没什么可被抢劫的，因而也就没什么可怕。这时，巴特里奇忍不住插嘴 说："先生，您也许认为那算不得什么。要是我口袋里装着一百镑钞票，像 您目前身上带的，我可不愿意让人抢去。我自己倒并不害怕，因为咱们一 共是四个人呢。只要咱们同心协力，英国最凶的强盗也劫不了咱们。假定 他有一支手枪，他也只能打死咱们中间的一个，而一个人只能死一回。是 的，一个人就能死一回，这就是我可以聊以自慰的。”
除了靠着人多势壮（当今某国也正是凭这种勇气才跃到光荣的顶峰） 之外，还有一个原因使得巴特里奇显示出这样非凡的胆量：酒力此刻正在 他身上发挥着作用。
这一行人离海格特驱不到半哩了。这时，那个陌生人突然掉转身来，掏 出手枪对准琼斯，向他索要巴特里奇提到的那张钞票。
开头，琼斯对这突然的一手感到很吃惊。可是他立刻镇定下来，告诉 那个强盗衣袋里所有的钱他尽管拿去，一面说，一面掏出三个多基尼递给 他。但是强盗咒骂了一声，说不成。琼斯冷冰冰地说，那就对不起了，然 后又把钱装回去。
强盗恫吓说，要是琼斯不立刻把那张钞票拿出来，他就只好开枪了 ――说时把枪瞄得离琼斯的胸膛不远。琼斯一把抓住汉子那只颤抖得几乎 握不住枪的手，拨开了枪口。于是，一场搏斗展开了。琼斯从对方手里夺 过枪，两人都从马背上滚了下来。那汉子仰卧在下面，胜利的琼斯骑在他 身上。
那个可怜的家伙开始向打败他的人求情一一老实说，论气力他远不是 琼斯的对手。"其实，"他说，"我并没存心向先生开枪。您看看，枪膛里并 没装子弹。我一辈子这是头一回干这种事儿，而且我完全是为贫困所迫。”
这当儿，在离他们大约一百五十码的地方也躺着一个人，用比那汉子 更高的声音嚷着救命。这人正是巴特里奇。琼斯和汉子交手的时候，他拼 命想逃跑，结果栽下马来，脸朝地躺在那里，头也不敢抬起来，随时准备 挨上一枪。
他就在这种姿势下一直躺着，直到那个一心一意惦记着自己的牲口的 向导拉住失足颠踬的马走到他跟前，告诉他说，老爷已经把强盗打败了。
听到这个消息，巴特里奇马上一跃而起，跑回刚才那个地方，看到琼 斯站在那里，持剑防备着那个可怜的汉子。巴特里奇一看到这情景，立刻 就嚷道："先生，杀了这个坏蛋！扎通他的胸口。马上干掉他！ ”
那汉子幸亏是落到一个心肠更软的人手里。琼斯检验了一下手枪，发 现确实没有上子弹，就相信了那汉子在巴特里奇走过来之前说的那番话： 他这是初次干这行当，实在是被贫困所逼，迫不得已；家里有五个嗷嗷待 哺的孩子，老婆又正在生产第六个，一家衣食无着，狼狈不堪。那人热烈 保证，句句是真话，并且提出，倘若琼斯先生肯光临相距不过两哩地的他 家来看看，就会相信了。他还说，他别无所求，只求证实一下他所说的统 统是实情。
琼斯最初装作打算认真照那汉子说的，到他家去查看，并且声言他的 命运整个取决于他的话是真是假。那个可怜的汉子听了这话，立刻表示+ 分乐意，从而使琼斯完全相信他说的是实话，开始对他同情起来。他把那 支空手枪还给那汉子，劝他想个正当办法来解除困难，并且给了他两个基 尼，接济他一家妻小的燃眉之急。随后又说，可惜不能再多帮他一些了， 因为那一百镑的票子不是他自己的。
对于琼斯此举，读者或者抱有不同的看法。有些人也许认为这是异常 仁义的行为，另外一些性格冷峻的则认为这样做对王法不够尊重。巴特里 奇当然就抱后一种看法。他表示非常不满，并且援引一句古代格言，说如 果在他们到达伦敦之前那个歹徒再袭击他们一下，也不足为奇。
那个行劫的汉子对琼斯感激得五体投地。他甚至淌下了眼泪一一也许 是装出的。他发誓一定马上回家，以后永远也不再干这种坏事一一他是否 信守诺言，以后也许可见分晓。
我们的旅客又重新跨上马，一路平安来到京城。途中，琼斯和巴特里 奇就刚才那段遭遇进行了长而有趣的交谈。琼斯对强盗表示了无限同情， 认为他们都是为贫困所迫，不得已才铤而走险的，最后大多是以耻辱的死
亡了结一生。四他说："我指的只是那些最多不过犯了抢劫之罪，而从不伤 害或侮辱人的强盗。说来这可算是咱们英国的光荣，因为其他国家的强 盗，抢劫几乎总是和杀人分不开的。”
"当然，"巴特里奇说，"夺人的钱财总比夺人的性命要好一些。然而老 实人出门办事总有遇上歹人的危险，这太糟糕啦。我认为宁可把强盗一古 脑儿绞死，也不应该让一个老实人遭到抢劫。我当然不愿意自己的手染上 这类坏蛋的血，可是法律应该把这种人一古脑儿绞死。除非我乐意送给一 个人六便士，不然的话，他凭什么硬从我手里抢过去？在这种人身上还谈 得上什么诚实？ ”
"当然谈不上，"琼斯大声说，"正如那个从旁人马厩里把马拉走，或者 拾到一笔钱明明晓得失主，却想留着自己花的人。”
这点暗示立刻封住了巴特里奇的嘴巴。他一直也没再开口。直到琼斯 拿他的胆小开玩笑，他才又用人抵不过武器的话来替自己辩护。他说："一 千名赤手空拳的人也干不过一支手枪。尽管一颗子弹只能打死一条命，焉 知道打的不正是我自己呢！”

十二天里的事
第一章
向诗神召唤［1］
啊，掌管荣誉的明眸之神，启发我这炽热的胸膛吧。我呼唤的不是借 千百万庶民的叹息来鼓篷扬帆、让英雄在血泊泪海上泛舟、把他渡到荣誉 之彼岸去的那位神祇；而是您一一欢乐的穆尼赛丝⑵在希布鲁斯河［3］岸初次 生下的美丽、温柔的姑娘％您在麦欧尼非］聆听教导，为曼图亚［6］所迷醉。 在那座俯瞰不列颠威震四方的首府的秀山上，您曾和您的宠儿弥尔顿并 坐，听他轻拨着悦耳的七弦琴。使我那贫乏的幻想充满对后世的美好愿望 吧。请您预先告诉我，将来会有一位多情的姑娘（尽管连她的祖母现在也 还没出世）通过苏菲亚这个虚拟的名字而看到我的夏洛特［7］所具备的真正的 美质，由于共鸣而从心坎上发出赞叹吧。请教给我不但能预见到后世对我 的称誉，并且能尽情享受一一甚至从后世的称誉中获得力量。请用这样一 个郑重的保证来安慰我吧：当我此刻起居的小室变成更加简陋的木匣子［8］ 时，我的作品仍将为那些不认识我、与我从没谋过面，同时也是我永不会 认识或会见的人们所阅读，并受到他们的称赞。
还有您一一更加丰满的姑娘，也是我所要呼唤的。您的身影既不虚无 缥缈，也没有披着幻想的衣裳。您喜爱的是烹调得可口的牛肉，和覆满了 葡萄干的布丁 ［9］。我呼唤的就是肥胖的少女和一个快活的阿姆斯特丹0］商人 交欢，在一条荷兰运河的拖船［以］上生下的您。在格鲁伯街［12］的学堂里，您打 下学问的根底。年事稍长，您就在这里教导诗不要去迎合保护人［13］的空想， 而应满足他的自豪感。喜剧从您那里学会了庄严肃穆的气氛，悲剧大声咆 哮，使得惶恐的观众震耳欲聋。历史大人叙述起冗长乏味的故事，把四肢 疲惫的您催入梦乡。传奇先生表演他那套惊人的妙技，以便把您唤醒。大 腹便便的书贾也同样看着您的眼色行事。那些长期睡在积满尘埃的架子 上、从来没人翻阅过的大部头书籍，在您的建议下分册出版，很快就散布 全国。有些书在您的指导下，像江湖郎中那样允诺奇迹去欺骗世人；而另 外一些书则变成了纨衿子弟，将其全部价值放在烫金的封皮上。来吧，可 爱的实惠，带着您那明朗的笑容。收回您的灵感，只把您那诱人的酬赏带 来吧：那堆积如山、熠熠发光、铿然作响的金钱，那立即可以兑成金银、 包含着看不见的巨富的支票，那行情时涨时落的股票，那温暖舒适的住 宅。最后，还有我应从慷慨的慈母那里领到的可观的一份一一要不是一部
分儿女贪婪任性地把亲兄弟挤开，她那丰富的奶汁本来足够哺育众多儿女 的。来吧，倘若我不会欣赏您那宝贵的赐予，那么就让我想到可以将它转 赠给旁人，用这个愉快的念头来温暖我的心胸吧。请告诉我：尽管那些咿 呀学语的娃娃们那天真无邪的戏耍经常被我的工作所打断，但由于您的恩 赐，有朝一日他们总会因我的工作而得到丰厚的酬赏。
促使我写作的就是这样很不相称的一对：瘦削的影子和肥胖的实体。 那么我呼唤谁来帮助指引我这支笔呢？
首先是天资，您是上天的恩赐。没有您的佐助，我们就只好徒然逆着 自然的川流而挣扎。您播下慷慨的种子，艺术将它们培育起来，使其臻于 完善。请您劳驾挽住我的手，引导我穿过自然的所有那些曲折迂回的迷 宫，看到俗眼凡胎从未见到的全部隐秘。教我把人类了解得比他们自己更 加清楚一一这在您是很容易办到的事。拨开那片蒙蔽凡人理智的云雾吧， 它使人们对某些人在行骗时使用的高超技巧表示钦佩，施用诈术时便表示 鄙夷，其实，他们只不过是嘲笑的对象，因为他们自己骗了自己。自高自 大假扮为智慧，贪得无厌假扮为富足，野心奢望假扮为荣誉，请您剥下它 们薄薄的伪装吧。来吧，曾经启发过阿里斯托芬、路喀阿努斯以、塞万提 斯、拉伯雷、莫里哀、莎士比亚、斯威夫特和马利伏M的您，请让我的文章 里充满幽默吧，好使人类学得善良到对旁人的愚蠢只是笑笑，谦虚到对自 己的愚蠢感到难过。
还有您，人道一一和真正的天才差不多是形影不离的伴侣，请赋予我 以您的一切仁爱之情吧。倘若您已经把它完全给予艾伦和李特顿也了，那么 就请暂时从他们的胸膛里盗出来吧。没有它，是无从描绘动人的场面的。 只有它才产生得出高贵无私的友谊，忘我的爱情，开阔的胸襟，深切的谢 忱，体贴入微的同情和直率的见解。一颗善良的心所具有的一切强大的力 量也起源于它；这股力量能使人们那润湿的眼睛里噙满泪水，用热血涨红 了人们那神采焕发的双颊，使悲哀、欢乐和仁慈像潮水般在人心中起伏不 已。
啊，再就是您，学问！（没有您的佐助，天资是产生不出任何纯粹或 正确的东西来的。）请您也来指引我这支笔吧。当我年少的时候，我曾在 您所喜爱的田野里崇拜过您。那里，清澈的、缓缓滚流着的泰晤士河冲刷 着伊顿以的河岸。我以道地的斯巴达人的忠诚，在您的桦木也祭坛上献过我 的鲜血。那么，就请您从历代积累下来的丰富库藏里，把大量的财宝赐给
我吧。打开您那麦欧尼亚和曼图亚的宝柜，还有收着您全部哲学、诗歌和 历史的库藏，不论您刻在这些巨橱上的是希腊文还是罗马字。请您把曾交 给沃伯顿也的那把可以打开所有这些宝库的钥匙，让我暂用一下吧。
最后，是经验。您早和聪明、善良、有学问、有教养的人十分熟识 了。但也不仅是这些人，您还熟悉各色各样的人，从清晨接见下属的大臣 到拘留债户的衙吏，从午后茶会上的公爵夫人到酒店柜台后面的老板娘。 只有通过您，我们才能了解人类的习尚。在这方面，不问世事的学究，不 论他才能多高，学问多渊博，也是不得其门而入的。
所有这一切都来吧，或者如果可能的话，其他方面也请光顾。因为我 从事的这项工作十分艰巨，没有大家的帮助，这个重担我是挑不起来的。 倘若你们对我的劳动报以微笑，那么我就可望顺利地把它完成。
第二章
琼斯先生到伦敦以后的遭遇
那位有学问的米扫宾四博士经常说：如果给他写信，信皮上只要写 上"世界，米扫宾博土收"就成了。意思是说，世上很少人不晓得他的大 名。仔细琢磨一下，我们也许将发现，远近驰名这一点是位居显贵的人享 有的许多幸福中颇为重要的一种。
在上一章里我们曾认为自己颇有希望扬名后世而沾沾自喜，但这种伟 大的福气却是只有极少数人能享受得到的。能具备足以成名的那几种千百 年来脍炙人口的因素（用西德纳姆丝的话来说）是得天独厚，那决不是爵位 和财产所能赋予的；除了用刀剑或笔，没有旁的办法能获得。然而活在世 上的时候就免于被诋毁为无名小卒（说来这种诽谤和荷马四的时代一样古 老），这一向是那些根据法律享有爵位和田产的人所称羡的福分。
因此，根据把苏菲亚带进京城来的那位爱尔兰贵族在本书中所显示的 派头，读者当然可以断定他必是人尽皆知的，不用晓得他住在伦敦哪条 街、哪条巷就可以轻而易举地找到他的公馆。老实说，对经常在大人物居 住的地区走动的商贩来说，原应如此，大人物府第的门是很容易找到的， 却很难进去。至于对琼斯和巴特里奇，伦敦则完全是陌生的。他最初来到 的那个地区的居民和汉诺威广场或戈洛斯沃纳广场的房主们几乎毫无往来 ――他是从葛雷学院四街进入伦敦的，转了好半天才走到这片安乐的府第 ――命运在这里把古代不列颠、撒克逊或丹麦人姓英雄豪杰的后裔与贩夫走 卒隔绝开来了；这些人的祖先生逢盛世，又为国家建立了功勋，使他们的 子子孙孙得享荣华富贵。
琼斯终于来到了这片人间乐土。他本应立即找到那位贵族的府第；不 幸贵族回爱尔兰时把先前的寓所退掉了，刚迁入新居，在这一带还不够赫 赫有名。因此，直到钟敲+一下，还没打听出个头绪。最后，琼斯只好依 从了巴特里奇的劝告，回到霍尔本的牛门旅店，就是他最初下榻的那家。 在这里，他享受到像他那种处境的人通常所想望的休息。
第二天一清早，他又动身去寻找苏菲亚。他疲惫地走了许多路，结果 还是一无所得。最后，不知是命运发了慈悲呢，还是它已无力再使琼斯失 望了，他竟然走到了由于那位贵族的迁入而大增光辉的那条街，并且找到 了那所宅子。他在门上轻轻敲了一下。
司阍从敲门声的胆怯，断定来者一定不是什么大人物，及至看到琼斯 先生那身打扮，和他原先估量的正也不相上下。这时琼斯穿的是一套麻布 衣裳，腰上挎着他从军士手里买的那柄剑一一尽管剑刃的钢是上好的，把 儿却不过是铜的，而且也不怎么光亮。因此，当琼斯问起随贵族一道来京 城的那位小姐的时候，他只是阴阳怪气地说："这儿没有小姐。"然后，琼 斯要求见见主人，对方回答说，主人当天早晨不会客。琼斯再三央求，司 阍说上边曾吩咐过，绝对不放人进宅。"如果你认为合适的话，就请留下姓 名，我好禀告大人，下回你再来时，就可以晓得大人什么时候肯接见了。”
这时，琼斯说他有事急于要见那位小姐，见不到她，决不离去。司阍 听了这话，就用不大愉快的声调和神情重申宅里没有小姐，所以根本就没 有他可见的人。然后又说："我从来也没见过你这种怪人：什么都告诉你 啦，你偏不听。"
我常常想，维吉尔在他的《伊尼特》第六卷里关于地狱司阍凯伯鲁斯省 那段详尽的描绘也许是为了讽刺当时大人物府第的司阍而写的，那幅图画 至少酷似那些荣幸给现代的大人物当司阍的人。此刻这贵族门房里的司阍 就和踞坐在洞窟里的凯伯鲁斯一模一样。想见见主人，就得像对凯伯鲁斯 那样先孝敬他点儿什么。琼斯大概就是以这种眼光来看待这位司阍的，并 且记起息琵尔丝为了替伊尼特买路，就曾用一件薄礼贿赂过阴曹地府的看门 者。这时，琼斯也照样来贿赂这人间的凯伯鲁斯。旁边一个男仆听说有点 好处可图，立刻走上前来说，倘若琼斯先生肯把那笔钱给他，他就愿意把 先生领到小姐那里去。琼斯马上答应了。于是，前一天曾服侍过两位女客 的那个仆人就把琼斯领到费兹帕特利太太的寓所去了。
没有比功败垂成更令人懊丧的了。纸牌桌上的赌徒仅因为低了一点而 输掉时，对自己的赌运不济就会比他在决无获胜希望的情况下输掉要感到 遗憾十倍。买彩票也是如此。接近头彩的号码的买主往往认为自己比其余 没中彩的人更加不幸。总之，这种仅以毫厘之差而失去的幸运似乎是命运 女神加于人的侮辱，可以说是在开我们的玩笑，拿我们的倒霉来寻开心。
琼斯已经被这位顽皮的异教女神戏弄过不止一次了，这回又尝到一次 大煞风景的滋味：他来到费兹帕特利太太的内前时，苏菲亚刚刚在十来分 钟以前离开了。他现在向服侍费兹帕特利太太的那个女仆打听。女仆告诉 他一个不愉快的消息：那位小姐已经走了，而且不晓得她的去向。后来费
兹帕特利太太本人也给了他同样的答复一一原来她以为琼斯一定是伯父魏 斯顿派来追寻苏菲亚的人，所以她是决不肯泄漏堂妹的踪迹的。
尽管琼斯从来没见过费兹帕特利太太，他却也听说过苏菲亚有个堂姐 嫁给姓费兹帕特利的人。不过，眼下他心慌意乱，一时没想起来。可是当 替他带路的那个仆人说起两位女客如何亲密，以堂姐妹相称的时候，他才 记起以前听说过的那桩婚姻。他马上认定这就是那个女人了，因而对她的 答复越发感到奇怪。他恳切要求会会费兹帕特利太太本人，可是她怎么也 不肯接见。
虽然琼斯从没进入过宫廷，可是他比大多数出入宫廷的人还知礼，决 不会对妇女有鲁莽孟浪的举动。因此，当她无论如何也不肯接见的时候， 琼斯就暂时告退了。他对女仆说，既然太太此刻不便会他，他就下午再来 拜访，希望那时候能荣幸地见到她。他说这段话时的彬彬有礼，以及他容 貌的俊秀给了那位女仆很好的印象。她忍不住说了声："也许那时候太太会 接见您吧。"后来，她也确实费了不少唇舌怂恿女主人会会这位"漂亮的年 轻绅士，，――她是这么称呼琼斯的。
琼斯很乖觉。他猜想苏菲亚本人现在多半就住在她堂姐家里，不过由 于厄普顿那件事还生着气，所以不肯见他。于是，他派巴特里奇替他去找 宿处，自己就一整天守在街头，两眼死死盯着据认为他的天使就藏在里头 的那座大门。可是除了那家的一个仆人，他不曾见到谁走出来。晚上，琼 斯又去拜访费兹帕特利太太，那位好妇人终于接见了他。
有些人生来具有一种文雅的仪态，凭衣着既打扮不出，想掩饰也掩饰 不住。琼斯先生（正如前面提过的）就极富有这种仪态。因此，那位太太 给予他的接待，大大超出了他的衣着似乎能奢求的。琼斯恰如其分地向她 问候之后，费兹帕特利太太就请他坐下。
谈话的结果对可怜的琼斯几乎没有帮助，所以我想读者也不会想了解 个中的细节。诚然，费兹帕特利太太很快就发觉这位客人正爱着苏菲亚 （所有的女人对这种事总是独具慧眼）；尽管如此，她仍然认为既然自己 是苏菲亚的知音，就不应把她的事泄漏给这样一个情人。一句话，她以为 琼斯就是苏菲亚所逃避的那个布利非先生，而她巧妙地从琼斯口中套出的 一些关于奥尔华绥先生府上的情况也证实了她那种想法。因此，对苏菲亚 的去向她坚决表示毫无所知，除了同意琼斯次晚再来拜访之外，什么也没 对他讲。
琼斯走后，费兹帕特利太太就把她怀疑这位客人是布利非先生的话对 女仆说了，女仆说："依我看，世上当然不会有女人想逃开这么一个漂亮的 男人。我倒觉得来的是琼斯先生。""琼斯先生！"太太说，"哪个琼斯？”关 于这个人，苏菲亚在全部谈话中间从没提过一个字，可是昂诺尔大姐却存 不住话，她把琼斯的事原原本本都告诉了她的女伴亚比该，如今亚比该又 对自己的女主人转述了一遍。
费兹帕特利太太一听到这话，立刻就同意了女仆的看法。令人不解的 是，她这时还立刻从这位被她冷落的乡绅身上发现了一个殷勤愉快的情郎 的翩翩风度一一这一点她刚才却没有看到。"贝蒂，"她说，"你的话一点儿 不差。他是个非常漂亮的人，难怪我堂妹的女仆告诉你许多女人都喜欢 他。如今我后悔没把我堂妹的住处告诉他。不过如果他真是像你说的那么 个可怕的浪荡汉，她再去会他可就惨了。逆着她父亲的意思嫁给这么个浪 荡汉和叫花子，那除了毁掉自己还能有什么旁的下场？依我说，如果他真 是像那个大姐形容给你的那种人，那么不让我堂妹会他倒是做了件好事。 我亲身尝尽了所遇非人的痛苦，如果我再这样害了她，那肯定是不可原谅 的。”
正说到这里，一位客人的到来打断了她的话。来的正是那位贵族。既 然他这次访问没有什么新的或了不起的内容，也与本书没什么干系，这一 章就到此告个段落吧。
第三章
费兹帕特利太太的一个计策，以及她造访贝拉斯顿夫人
费兹帕特利太太安歇的时候，她的心思完全给她堂妹苏菲亚和琼斯先 生的事占据了。如今发现了苏菲亚对她不坦率，她颇有些气恼。沉思了没 多久，她心里就冒出这么个念头：倘若她设法叫苏菲亚摆脱这个人，把她 送回她父亲身边，就可以在家族里立下一个大功，从事理人情来看，很可 能使她跟魏斯顿伯父和姑妈言归于好。
既然这是她最巴不得做到的一件事，所以看来成功的希望很大，如今 需要考虑的只是用什么计策来实现这个计划罢了。她觉得不宜当面用道理 去说服苏菲亚，因为贝蒂听昂诺尔大姐说，苏菲亚非常爱琼斯，所以她认 为去劝她不要嫁这个人等于去恳切劝阻飞蛾不要扑向烛火。
如果读者还记得苏菲亚和贝拉斯顿夫人是在魏斯顿女士家里认识的， 当时费兹帕特利太太也住在那里，那么不用说大家就会晓得费兹帕特利太 太也认识贝拉斯顿夫人了。而且，两人都是那位夫人的远亲呢。
经过再三考虑之后，她决计第二天一清早就去见那位夫人，背着苏菲 亚把这件事全告诉她。那位稳重的夫人平时言谈间经常挖苦男女恋爱和在 终身大事上的不审慎，所以费兹帕特利太太毫不怀疑她会同意自己对这件 婚事的见解，并且尽力协助她予以阻止。
于是，她就去执行这个决定。第二天一清早，太阳还没出来，她就草 草穿上衣服，在这极不宜于拜客的时间来到了贝拉斯顿夫人的府上，见到 了她，一点也没教苏菲亚有所察觉或起什么疑心。这时苏菲亚虽然已经醒 了，却还躺在床上，旁边的昂诺尔则鼾声如雷。
费兹帕特利太太为着自己这么早冒昧来访，连连道歉，说倘若不是有 极其重大的事情，她决不会想到来打搅夫人的。随后，她就把从贝蒂那里 听来的话和盘托出，琼斯头天晚上去拜访她的事自然也没漏掉。
贝拉斯顿夫人笑了笑说："那么您已经见过这个可怕的人了吗？请告诉 我，他确实像人家形容的那么漂亮吗？因为昨天晚上艾托芙在我面前讲了 他差不多两个钟头。我相信那个小妮子一听到他的名字就爱上他啦。"大家 读至此也会奇怪贝拉斯顿夫人是怎么晓得的呢？原来服侍夫人穿戴的艾托 芙大姐听到了关于这位琼斯先生的全部情况，头天晚上，或者不如说今天
早晨，在替她卸装的时候一五一十地全讲给她听了。为了这个缘故，她在 夫人的房里足足呆了不止一个半钟头。
夫人平素在这种时候就喜欢听艾托芙大姐谈天说地，现在对她所讲关 于琼斯的话，听得更是格外仔细。昂诺尔曾形容过琼斯长得如何俊秀，艾 托芙大姐忙中又在这方面添枝加叶地夸说了一番，使得贝拉斯顿夫人简直 把琼斯当作造物的一桩奇迹了。
艾托芙激起了夫人的好奇心。如今，费兹帕特利太太先贬低琼斯的出 身、人品和家当，然后又夸他生得如何漂亮，使贝拉斯顿夫人的兴趣更加 大了起来。
贝拉斯顿夫人把这番话全听完之后，就一本正经地说："夫人，这确实 是一件关系重大的事。你处理得再得体不过了。我很愿意在保全这位小姐 的事上尽到自己的一份力量。她各方面都很好，我十分看重她。”
"夫人，"费兹帕特利太太急切地说，"您看最好是不是由我立刻写封信 给我伯父，告诉他堂妹在这儿呢？"
夫人沉吟了一下，这样回答道："我觉得不要那么做。戴•魏斯顿曾经告 诉我她哥哥为人粗暴野蛮，我决不能同意把从他手里逃出的姑娘再送回他 那儿去。我听说他对他的妻子也是非常野蛮的。他这种坏人总以为自己有 权利来虐待咱们妇女。凡是不幸处在这种人淫威之下的女人，我认为一切 做妇女的就应该把她拯救出来。亲爱的外甥女，我看咱们要做的只是不让 那个年轻人跟魏斯顿小姐会面；等她在我家有机会见到一些体面的人，她 也就会改变想法啦。”
"夫人，"对方说，"如果他一旦晓得了堂妹住在哪儿，您可以相信他会 不顾一切非见到她不可的。”
"可是，他决不会找到这儿来的，"夫人说，"不过，他可能探听出魏斯 顿小姐的住处，然后在我家左近转悠……所以，我最好能认一认他。夫 人，你不能设法让我见他一面吗？不然的话，外甥女，苏菲亚说不定会背 着我跟他在这儿见面呢。”
费兹帕特利太太回答说：这人曾吓唬她，说当天下午还要到她家来； 倘若夫人那时肯光临，那么在六七点钟之间准可以见到他。万一他来得更 早些，她就一定想法留住他，等夫人到来。贝拉斯顿夫人回答说，她吃过 晚饭立刻来，估计绝不会迟于七点，因为她非见见这个人不可。"夫 人，"她说，"你这样关怀魏斯顿小姐，真是太好了。不过，不论从普通的
人道还是就家族关系来讲，都需要咱们二人合力来阻止住他们的往来，不 然的话，这门亲事真不堪设想！”
费兹帕特利太太听了夫人关于她的堂妹所说的这些恭维话，就也合乎 体统地寒暄了一番。两人又闲谈了几句之后，费兹帕特利太太就告辞了。 她没让苏菲亚和昂诺尔瞥见，尽快坐上轿子回家去了。
第四章
关于拜访
整整一天，琼斯先生走来走去，眼睛一直没离开那座大门。那是最短 的白昼之一，在他看来却是一年之中最长的一天。好容易等到钟敲五下， 他才又去拜访费兹帕特利太太。尽管这距离正常的会客时间还早了足足一 个钟头，那位太太还是彬彬有礼地接待了他，然而她仍然坚持说不晓得苏 菲亚的去向。
琼斯在打听他的天使的时候，无意中用了"堂妹”这个词儿。于是，费 兹帕特利太太就说："那么先生，您晓得我们是亲属了。我们既然是堂姐 妹，那么您就允许我有权问您一声：找我堂妹有什么事？”琼斯踌躇了好半 天，最后回答说，他手里有她的一笔数目不小的款子，打算亲自交还给 她。于是，他掏出那只皮夹子，告诉费兹帕特利太太里面有些什么，以及 是怎样落到他手里的。话还没讲完，就听到一声巨响，使整座房子都震动 起来。作为亲自听到的人，我们没法形容那声音之大；想让没听见的人去 设想是如何之大，就更加办不到。它真可以说是：
-Non acuta
Sic geminant Corybantes ^ra.[27]
库贝利四庙的祭司敲他们的铜钟，
也没这么急骤。
总之，是一个听差在敲一一或者不如说在擂着门。琼斯从来还没听过 这种声音，有些吃惊。可是费兹帕特利太太很冷静地说，由于有客人来 了，现在她不便回答。不过，倘若他肯等到客人走了，那么，她还有点话 要告诉他。
这时，房内突然大开，贝拉斯顿夫人先把她的裙箍斜着挤进来，然后 她本人才来到房里。她先朝费兹帕特利太太深深屈膝行礼，随后又朝琼斯 先生也照样行了一礼，接着被让到房间的上首。
我们是为了我们认识的一些乡下妇女才叙述这些细节的，她们总以为
对男人屈膝行礼是有失分寸的。
这几位刚刚坐定，前边提过的那位贵族来了。于是，大家又骚动一 番，重新行了一通礼。
礼毕，就开始了所谓极其精彩的谈话。不过，谈的话可以说与这部历 史都不相干一一其实，说的全是些闲话，这里就不必去记述了。尤其因为 我晓得有些很高雅的谈话，一旦写到书里或搬到舞台上，就显得索然无味 了。这种精神食品确实是上等社会以外的人永远也不会欣赏的珍馐，正如 他们无法欣赏法国厨师所做、只在大人物的餐桌上才看得见的几种美味一 样。老实说，既然这两者都不适合众人的口味，对普通人来说，往往不如 抛开的好。
在这高雅的场合，可怜的琼斯与其说是其中的一个演员，倒不如说是 个观众，因为尽管在贵族来到之前，那短短一段时间里，贝拉斯顿夫人和 费兹帕特利太太先后和他谈了几句话，可是那位贵族刚一进来就把两位妇 女的注意力都吸引过去了。既然在贵族眼里就好像没有琼斯这个人在场， 只是偶尔瞪他一两眼，妇女们也就效法他的榜样。
客人们都坐了好久，费兹帕特利太太看出显然谁也不肯先走。于是， 她决计先把琼斯弄走，认为在来客中间，对他最不需要讲求礼貌了。她就 乘着谈话间歇的当儿一本正经地对他说："先生，看来今晚我不可能答复您 那个问题了。不过，倘若您留下个地址，明天我可以派人给您送个……”
琼斯对社交场合的规矩并不熟悉，他只是天生地知情达礼。因此，他 并没把自己的住址说给宅里一个仆人，却径直告诉了费兹帕特利太太本人 了。随后不久，他就彬彬有礼地告辞而出。
琼斯在座时，那些大人物对他毫不理睬；他一走，他们却对他十分注 意起来。既然读者原谅我们略去前一段精彩的谈话，那么我们也就不再去 重复他们后一段可以说是粗俗的谩骂。不过，提一提贝拉斯顿夫人的一句 话对本书还是不无关系的。在琼斯走后不久，她也告了辞。临走时对费兹 帕特利太太说："关于苏菲亚的事，我现在放心了。这个家伙对她不会有什 么危险的。”
这部历史也将仿照贝拉斯顿夫人的榜样，和客厅里的人（如今只剩下 两位了）告别。既然这两人之间的事与读者毫不相干，我们也就不必为此 分心，还是把笔墨用在更重要的、也是大家所关心的主人公的事情上吧。
第五章
琼斯先生在寓所里的一桩奇遇。简单介绍一下和他同住的一位年轻 绅士、房东太太和她的两个女儿
第二天早晨，琼斯在再早就会有失体统的时刻，来到费兹帕特利太太 的门口。宅里回复他太太不在家。他听了十分诧异，因为他从天亮起就一 直在那条街上徘徊。如果那位太太出门了，他必定会看到。但是他无法不 接受这个答复，而且不只这一回，那天他一连造访了五回，每回都得到同 样的答复。
对读者打开窗子说亮话吧，那位贵族由于这种或那种原因一一也许出 于保护费兹帕特利太太的名声，坚决不让她再接见琼斯先生。他把琼斯看 作个下等人。那位太太已经答应他照办了。我们也看到她是在严格履行这 个诺言。
不过列位读者对这个年轻绅士的看法也许比那位太太要好一些，大家 甚至还会多少关怀他，怕他这样不幸地同苏菲亚隔离之后，不知是住进了 什么客店还是流落街头了。那么我们这里就说说他的寓所。他住的确实是 个很体面的人家，坐落在京城里很好的一个地区。
琼斯先生常听奥尔华绥先生讲起他每到伦敦总前往住宿的一个人家的 女主人。琼斯也晓得她住在邦德街。女主人居孀，她已故的丈夫是位牧 师。牧师遗给她的只有两个女儿和整套讲道手稿。
两个女儿，大的叫南锡，今年已十七岁。小的叫贝蒂四，今年十岁。
先前，琼斯就是把巴特里奇派到这家来找住处的。那里在三楼替琼斯 预备下一间房，在五楼为巴特里奇留了一间。
二楼住的是一位在前一时代曾有"寻欢作乐的风流才子"之称的那种年 轻绅士，而且称呼得十分恰当。因为我们通常是按照一个人的行当或他所 从事的职业来称呼他的，既然命运已经使得这类先生无需干什么有用的工 作，寻欢作乐就成为他们唯一的行当或职业。戏园、咖啡店和酒馆是他们 欢聚的地方。他们专说些诙谐、俏皮的话来消闲解闷，比那更正经些的勾 当就是谈情说爱。酒和缪斯们在他们的胸膛里燃起炽热的火焰。他们不但 崇拜心目中的美人，其中有些人还能提笔颂赞，以及品评这类诗文的长 短。
这就是所谓的"寻欢作乐的风流才子"。不过，把这个称号用到当代那些 志在以才艺出众的年轻绅士身上倒未必妥当。他们当然谈不上机智。平心 而言，这些人要胜他们先辈一筹，可以称之为具有智慧和见识（请注意： 不是品德）的人。当上述那些先生们向美女祝酒、写诗咏赞、在剧院里发 表剧评或在威尔或勃顿咖啡店品评诗歌，借以消磨岁月的时候，这些先生 们却在考虑着如何收买某社团的选票，要么就为议会里的一个发言或者打 算在杂志上发表的一篇文章打着腹稿。不过，他们心思用得最多的还是在 赌博这门学问上。在这上头他们认真下工夫研究。至于作为消遣，他们在 广泛的领域里是行家，包括绘画、音乐、雕刻和自然哲学，或者不如称之 为不自然的哲学,因为它涉及的都是些不可思议的事物，除了怪诞和畸形 的东西之外，与自然全无干系。
琼斯为了求见费兹帕特利太太，白白地花了一整天的时间，最后只好 垂头丧气地回到寓所。正当他独自一人痛苦悲伤的时候，猛然听到楼下一 片吵闹声。紧接着是一个女人的声音，央求他快来救命。琼斯在扶危济困 方面向不后人，马上就跑下楼去，跨进发出喊声的餐厅，看到我们上边提 过的一位具有智慧和见识的人士正被他自己的仆人紧紧挤在墙上，旁边站 着个年轻女人，双手扭来扭去，嚷着："他会给杀死的！他会给杀死 的！"那位可怜的绅士确实有可能给掐死。琼斯于是飞快赶上前去，正当他 奄奄一息的时候把他从对方无情的手掌里救了出来。
尽管这跟班也挨了那位胆量胜过力气的少爷几下拳打脚踢，但他毕竟 是他的主人，不能不有所顾忌，所以只掐住他的脖子，没使出全副本事。 可是对琼斯他却毫无敬意，所以一发觉这个新来的敌手态度不客气，就朝 他的肚子狠狠揍了一拳，这一拳布劳敦四竞技场上的观众看起来也许很过 瘾，然而挨上的人却不会感到舒服的。
这个壮实的小伙子受到这一拳之后，立刻也回敬了一下。于是，琼斯 和那个仆人就打作一团。这场搏斗很激烈，可是为时却不长。那个仆人不 是琼斯的对手，正如他的主人不是他的对手一样。
这时，命运依照惯例把局势翻转过来了。先前那位胜利者反而气喘吁 吁地倒在地上，而原来败下来的那位绅士却缓过气来，感谢琼斯先生及时 的援救。在场的那位年轻姑娘也向他热烈致谢，原来她就是这家的长女南 锡小姐。
那个仆人站起身来，对琼斯摇了摇头，带着机警的神情叫道："妈的， 我再也不跟你来这手啦。没错儿，你准是杂技场上练武艺的。"其实，我们 倒可以原谅他这种怀疑，因为本书的主人公确实手脚矫健，气力过人，也 许打得过第一流的拳击家，可以从从容容地就把布劳敦先生学堂里那些戴 皮手套也］的毕业生一个个都打败。
这位气鼓鼓的主人吩咐仆人马上脱下号衣，那汉子答应领了工资就 脱。事情照办了，于是，就把这人辞退。
这位姓耐廷盖尔的年轻绅士死乞白赖地非要和搭救他的人喝一通酒不 可。经过再三邀请，琼斯才由于礼貌而不是出于意愿答应下来；因为此刻 他心里惶惶不安，实在不适于应酬。南锡小姐的妈妈和妹妹出去看戏了， 这时她是寓所里唯一的女性。她也惠然同意参加这番小酌。
酒瓶、酒杯摆好之后，那位绅士就谈起刚才这场纠纷的原委。
"先生，"他对琼斯说，"我希望您不要因为这件事就断定我一贯好殴打 仆人。您可以相信，在我的记忆中这是头一次，而在他这回把我激怒得忍 无可忍之前，我已经多次饶恕过他的无礼举动。我相信听到今晚这件事的 经过之后，您一定会认为我打他是情有可原的。今天我比往日早回来几个 钟头，看到四个仆人正在我炉旁打纸牌呢，而我的一本霍伊尔图的作品一一 先生，我花一个基尼买来的那本精装的豪伊勒的作品正摊在桌上，全书最 重要的一页上洒了好多黑啤酒。这应该说是够气人的了，可是我当时一句 话也没说。等这伙人走了之后，我才轻轻责备他几句。他不但毫不感到难 过，却反而厚着脸皮对我说，仆人也应该像旁人一样有点消遣。至于把书 弄脏了点，他很抱歉；不过他好几个朋友都只花一个先令就买到同一本 书，如果高兴的话，我尽可以从他的工资里扣。这时，我才对他比原来更 严厉一些。这个流氓居然无礼到……一句话，他把我回来得早些说成是为 了……一句话，他指责我……他提到了一位小姐的名字……而且带着那么 一种神情……我气得实在忍无可忍，在盛怒之下才打了他。”
琼斯回答说，他相信谁也不会责备他。"老实说，如果我遇到类似令人 气恼的事，我也会这样做的。”
坐下来没多久，刚从戏院里回来的母亲和她的小女儿也参加进来了， 如今大家一道过了个愉快的晚上。除了琼斯，人人都欢天喜地的一一甚至 连他也竭力装出快活的样子。其实，琼斯只消拿出他的一半旺盛的精力， 再加上他那柔和的性子，就足以使他成为一个极其融洽的友伴。尽管他心
情沉重，可是他却让大家都感到十分欢畅。分手的时候，那位年轻的绅士 诚恳希望与他进一步结交。南锡小姐也非常高兴同他在一起。居孀的房东 太太十分喜欢这位新房客，邀他和耐廷盖尔先生次晨一道用早膳。
琼斯也很满意。那位南锡小姐个子虽然不大，生得却非常秀丽；那位 年近五+的寡妇也有着她那样年纪所能有的风韵。她是天地间最纯朴的 人，因而也是最愉快的。凡是不好的事，她决不去想，不去说，也不去盼 望。她总愿意旁人高兴一一在一切愿望中间这是最可喜的一种。这种愿望 只要不为矫揉造作所败坏，大都可以实现的。一句话，尽管力量微薄，她 却是一位极其热诚的朋友。她曾经深深爱过自己的丈夫，她又是个最慈祥 不过的母亲。既然我们这部历史像报纸一样，对以前从未听说过、以后也 不会再提的人物决不去大事表扬，那么读者可以断定这位完美的妇人此后 必将在本书中具有一定的重要性。
琼斯对邀他饮酒的那位年轻绅士也颇喜欢。他看出那人很有见识，可 惜染上不少纨衿子弟气。不过最赢得琼斯好感的还是那人偶尔道出的一些 慷慨而仁厚的见解，尤其关于恋爱方面许多舍己为人的话。在这个问题上 他用的宛如是一个古代阿凯迪亚向牧人的语言，这种话出自当代一位体面绅 士之口，是显得很奇怪的。然而他只不过是个模仿者，造物主却是要他扮 演一个更好的角色的。

第六章
宾主正用早膳时发生的事情，顺便谈一些对管教女儿的看法
昨晚他们友好地分了手，今晨又在同样友好的心情下聚首了。不过可 怜的琼斯非常悲伤，因为巴特里奇刚才告诉他说，费兹帕特利太太已经搬 走了，而且也打听不出她的去向。这个消息使琼斯十分难过。不论他怎样 想掩饰，从脸色到举止都露出他感到心慌意乱。
像上次一样，话题如今转到恋爱上了。耐廷盖尔先生又在这个问题 （明达稳重的男人称之为浪漫，可是明达稳重的女人总对它抱着更善意的 看法）上发表了许多热情、豪迈、无私的见解。密勒太太（这就是这家女 主人的姓氏）听了，十分称许。可是当这位年轻绅士问到南锡小姐时，她 只回答说，她相信话说得最少的那位先生领会得最深。
这句恭维话显然是针对琼斯而发的，倘若他置之不理，我们会觉得遗 憾的。他对南锡小姐说了几句非常客气的话，不过最后暗示她自己的沉默 也引起了同样的怀疑一一事实上，不论昨晚还是此刻，她都几乎没开过 口。
"南妮醐，"密勒太太说，"我很高兴这位先生指出这一点来了，我的看 法和他差不多。孩子，你怎么啦？我从来没看到你变得这样厉害过。你那 股活泼勤儿哪里去了？先生，您能相信吗？我时常管她叫我的小饶舌。可 是这个星期她还不曾说上二十个字儿呢。”
这时，进来一个女仆把话打断了。她手里拿着一包东西，说是一个门 房送来让交给琼斯先生的。然后又补了一句：那人立刻就走了，说不需要 回信。
琼斯表示有点惊奇，认为一定是弄错了。可是那女仆一口咬定说确实 指明是交给琼斯先生的。在座的妇女们都希望立刻把那个包儿打开看看。 在琼斯先生的同意之下，最后由小贝蒂照办了。里头包着一件连巾袍、一 副假面具和一张化装舞会的入场券。
琼斯更认为这一定是送错了人，密勒太太也有几分怀疑，说她也莫名 其妙。可是一问起耐廷盖尔先生，他却另有一番见解："我所能断言的就 是：您是个幸运儿。毫无疑问，这是一位小姐送给您的，在化装舞会上， 您将会见到她。”
琼斯没有那么大虚荣心，不曾想入非非；密勒太太本来也不很赞成耐 廷盖尔先生的说法。可是这时南锡小姐拿起那件连巾袍来，袖口里掉出一 张卡片，上面写着：
琼斯先生：
这是天宫仙后赠与你的，
切勿辜负她一番盛意。
这时候，密勒太太和南锡小姐才同意耐廷盖尔先生的看法一一甚至琼 斯本人差不多也这么看了。他心想：既然除了费兹帕特利太太之外，没有 旁的女人晓得他的住所，他就开始这样陶醉起来：说不定是费兹帕特利太 太送来的，因而也许会在舞会上见到他的苏菲亚呢。其实，这份希望并没 什么根据。不过，既然费兹帕特利太太始而答应接见他，继而又爽约不 见，并且搬了家，这事令他百思不解，他以前又听人说过这位太太有些古 怪，就隐隐抱起一种希望：也许她拒绝了用普通的办法帮他忙，却打算用 奇怪的方式为他效劳呢。老实说，既然这件事来得如此不寻常，而难以捉 摸，就给他留下任意推想的余地。他天生又是个乐观的人，这时想象力恣 意驰骋，为当晚可以会见他心爱的苏菲亚设想出一千条证据。
读者，倘若您对我有什么良好的祝愿，那么我也用祝您有这种乐观的 性格来酬答您的盛意。许多伟大作家在幸福这个题目上费过不少笔墨。关 于它，我读过很多东西，也思考过很长时候。我大致把幸福归结为具有这 种乐观的性格。这样一来，就使我们摆脱了财运的辖制，没有它的帮忙， 我们照样也可以幸福。事实上，这种性格所给予我们的快感，远比财运那 个瞎女人所给予的更为持久而深切。自然安排得十分英明，它让我们在一 切真正的享受上，都既感到惬意而又感到不满足，唯恐我们整个为它吸引 住而不再作进一步的追求。根据这一观点，我毫不怀疑那刚考上律师的未 来大法官、刚披上袈裟的未来大主教，以及议会里刚坐上反对党末席的未 来首相，要比实际已经拥有这些职位所赋予的权柄和利益的人更加幸福。
这时，琼斯先生已经决定当晚参加化装舞会，耐廷盖尔先生表示愿意 给他带路。这位年轻的绅士同时要送入场券给南锡小姐和她的母亲，可是 那位可敬的妇人谢绝了。她说她并不像有些人那样把化装舞会想得很坏， 不过这种奢侈的娱乐只有有身份、有家当的人才配享受，决不适宜于需要
自谋生计、充其量不过嫁个规规矩矩生意人的姑娘去享受。"嫁个生意 人!"耐廷盖尔嚷道，"您可不能这么小看我的南锡。世上没有哪个王公贵 族她配不上的哎哟，耐廷盖尔先生，"密勒太太说，"您可别往这丫头 脑子里灌这种非分的想法！不过，万一她走运，”（做妈妈的说到这儿勉强 作了个笑容）"能嫁上一位有您这样胸襟的绅士，我就希望她能好好报答对 方的慷慨，而不是整天去想着吃喝玩乐。自然，年轻的太太要是带来很大 -笔陪嫁，她们就有权利拿自己的东西挥霍一下。因此我听有些先生们 说，一个男人讨个穷老婆有时比讨个阔老婆还上算……可是不管我的女儿 们嫁给谁，我都愿意她们给自己的丈夫带来幸福……所以，请您不要再提 化装舞会啦。南锡是个好姑娘，我相信她决不会想去的。她一定还记得去 年您带她去过的那一趟，弄得她晕头转向的，后来足有一个月还昏头昏脑 的，也不摸针线了。”
尽管从南锡胸膛里偷偷呼出的一声叹息来看，她暗地里对她母亲的这 席话是不很赞同的，但是她没敢公然反驳，因为这位好太太具有一个做母 亲的全部慈爱，同时保持了一个做母亲的一切权威。而且，由于她对孩子 们的约束纯粹是为了她们的安全和未来的好处，所以她也决不容许自己的 命令遭到违背或反驳。已在这里住过两年的这位年轻绅士十分清楚这些情 况，所以密勒太太一谢绝，他就马上同意了。
耐廷盖尔先生越来越喜欢琼斯，非常希望邀他当天去一家酒馆吃中 饭，想给他介绍几个朋友，可是琼斯辞谢了，说他的衣箱还没运到京城 来。
说老实话，琼斯先生目前正处在有些比他更显贵的人时或也会陷入的 一种境地。一句话，他衣袋里一文不名。这种处境在古代哲学家中间，要 远比在那些居住在伦巴德街［约，或者常出入怀特巧克力店的现代聪明人中间 更受到尊重。也许正因为那些哲学家把囊空如洗看成是莫大的荣誉，所以 他们才在上述那条街上和那家巧克力店里深深遭到唾弃。
倘若古人认为人光靠道德就可以生活得很舒服的那种见解确实是（有 如上述那些现代聪明人居然发现出来的）荒谬绝伦，那么我恐怕有些传奇 作家认为男人光靠爱情就可以生活的论调也同样是错误的。不论爱情会给 我们某部分感官或胃口带来怎样的盛馔，它对其他部分的感官或胃口肯定 无法满足。因此，曾经过分信赖这些作家的人一旦发现不对头时，已经太
晚了。他们这才认识到爱情之不能充饥，正如蔷薇之不能悦耳，或小提琴 之不能使人感到芳香一样。
所以尽管爱情在琼斯面前摆出各种山珍海味，即是说，可望在化装舞 会上见到苏菲亚（不论这种设想多么缺乏根据，他一整天却都陶醉在这一 期待上），可是一到黄昏，琼斯先生就开始渴望一种更粗糙的食物了。巴 特里奇凭直觉发现这个情况，就乘机暗示何妨动用那张钞票。当这个想法 遭到琼斯的鄙夷和拒绝时，他就鼓起勇气重新提出回到奥尔华绥先生府上 的建议。
"巴特里奇，"琼斯大声说，"我对我自己的前途看得比你还要悲观绝 望。我开始由衷地后悔让你抛下你那安身立业的地方，跟着我这么到处奔 波。不过，我此刻一定要你回去。为了补偿你为我花的钱，操的心，所有 我托你照看的衣物都请你收下吧。此外恕我没有旁的办法来表示自己的一 点心意了。”
他说这话的时候声调十分悲怆。巴特里奇虽有缺点，但他对人从不怀 歹意，也不会硬起心肠。所以他淌下了眼泪。他先发誓决不能在患难中丢 下琼斯，随后又恳切地劝琼斯还是回家去的好。"看在老天爷面上，先 生，"他说，"请您仔细寻思一下，您能有什么办法？在这样的城市里，没 有钱怎么能住得下去！先生，随便您做什么，或是到哪里去，我是决不背 弃您的。可是，先生，请您考虑一下……为了您自己的缘故，务必好好考 虑一下。我相信您的理智一定会劝您回家去。”
"我得告诉你多少遍我是无家可归的呢？"琼斯回答说，"奥尔华绥先生 的大门但凡有一线希望会为我敞开着，即使没遇到困苦我也会回去的。 不，世上再没有旁的理由会阻止我马上飞到他身边去。可是，唉！我已经 永远被赶出来了。他最后的一句话是（啊，巴特里奇，这句话直到今天还 在我耳边），当他把一笔钱交给我时（我也不晓得究竟是多少，我相信是 可观的一笔），最后说的一句话是：’我已经决定从今天起跟你一刀两 断。
说到这儿，感情堵住了琼斯的嘴，正如惊愕堵住了巴特里奇的嘴一 样；不过，巴特里奇很快就恢复了说话的能力。他先表白了几句，说他向 来不好打听旁人的私事，接着就问琼斯他说不晓得究竟是多少，可又说很 可观的一笔，是什么意思，以及那笔钱的下落。
在这两个问题上，他都得到了满意的答复。他刚要发表自己的意见， 这时恰好耐廷盖尔先生派人来送口信，请琼斯到他的房间里去。
两位绅士打扮停当，准备去参加化装舞会了。正当耐廷盖尔先生派人 去雇轿子的时候，琼斯为一件事窘住了。这件事在许多读者看来会是很可 笑的：他不晓得怎样去弄到一个先令。不过，倘若这样的读者设想一下： 当他们想去办一件很想办的事，可是缺少一千镑，或者一两万镑时是一种 什么样的心情，他们也就能很好地体会琼斯先生此刻的感觉了。为了弄到 这个先令，他只好向巴特里奇启齿一一这是他第一次向这个可怜的家伙借 钱，他也想把这作为最后的一次。老实说，巴特里奇近来在这方面已经不 大肯帮忙了。这也许是因为他盼望琼斯动用那张钞票，要不就是希望困境 迫使琼斯回家去，抑或出于旁的动机，我无法断言。
第七章
化装舞会的始末经过
两位骑士这时来到伟大的Ariter Deliciarum[36],欢乐的祭司海地格区 所主持的庙堂。像所有的异教祭司一样，他也哄骗善男信女仿佛庙堂里真 有什么神祇一一事实上并没有。
耐廷盖尔先生陪琼斯兜了一两个圈子，不久就跟一个女人一道走掉 了，他说："先生，您既然到了这里，就自己去巡猎吧。”
琼斯满心希望他的苏菲亚会在场。这份希望比所有舞场上的灯光、音 乐和舞客都更使他兴奋，尽管那些也都是解愁的良药。这时只要看到哪个 女人的身材、体态和风姿跟他的天使稍稍有些相像，他就过去打招呼。对 所有这些人他都设法说上几句俏皮话，好刺得对方非答腔不可，这样他自 信就可以发现那个他不可能听错的声音。有些人尖声尖气地反问他："您认 得我吗？”大多数人只说："先生，我跟您并不相识。"再没旁的话了。有些 人喊他作冒失鬼；有些人根本不答腔；有些人说："我认不出您的声音来， 我没话跟您说。"有不少人回答得十分客气，然而声音都不是他所要听到 的。
正当他和最后这批人中间的一个（她化装成一个牧羊女）讲话的时 候，一位穿连巾袍的夫人来到他跟前，拍了他肩膀一下，同时小声在他耳 边说："你要是再跟那个野女人谈话，我就告诉魏斯顿小姐去。”
琼斯一听到这个名字，立刻就离开原来和他交谈的人，向那穿连巾袍 的苦苦哀求，如果她提到的那位小姐眼下就在厅里的话，请她无论如何指 给他。
那个戴假面具的女人先匆匆忙忙走到最靠里的一个房间的上首才开 口。她并没答复琼斯的请求，却坐了下来，说她累了。琼斯也在她身旁坐 下，仍然继续央求着。最后，那位夫人冷冷地回答："我还以为琼斯先生是 个眼光锐利的情人，不会因为自己心爱的人化了装就认不出来呢。皿夫 人，她在这儿吗？”琼斯急急追问。那位夫人听了叫道："嘘，先生，别说 话，那样会惹人注目的。我用人格向你担保，魏斯顿小姐不在这儿。”
这时，琼斯拉住戴假面具的人的手，极其恳切地央求着，问她哪里可 以找到苏菲亚。当琼斯总也得不到一个直截了当的答复时，他就温和地责 备对方前天不该害他空跑一趟。最后说："其实，我的好仙后，尽管您装出
假嗓音，我还是很好地认出您来了。老实说，费兹帕特利太太，您这样拿 我的痛苦来寻开心，未免有点太残忍了。”
戴假面具的回答说："虽然您很巧妙地猜出我是谁来了，可我还是得用 假嗓音讲话，不然，旁人就会也把我认出来了。好先生，难道您以为我对 我堂妹就那么不加爱护，竟然帮助你们俩去勾勾搭搭，结果必然把我堂妹 的终身葬送掉，同时也毁了您自己吗？而且，即使您非跟她为敌不可，硬 要来引诱她走上这条路，我相信我堂妹也不至于疯狂到自甘毁灭的地步。”
"唉，夫人！"琼斯说。"说我跟苏菲亚为敌，您是一点也不知道我的 心。”
"可是您必须承认，"对方叫道，"把任何人的终身葬送掉总是敌对的举 动吧。倘若您明明晓得这样做一定也会毁灭您自己，这岂不是愚蠢、疯 狂，同时也是罪孽吗？告诉您，先生，就我堂妹的身份来说，她名下的产 业可不算多一一除非她老子肯留给她点什么（您是晓得他的为人的），此 外她简直就没什么私蓄了。同时，您也明白自己的处境。”
琼斯发誓说，他在苏菲亚身上决没有这类打算。他说，宁愿自己横 死，也决不肯牺牲她的利益来满足自己的欲望。他还说，自知不论哪方面 都配不上她，因此，早就决心放弃这种想望了。可是后来又发生了一些奇 怪的事情，使得他急于再见她一面，然后就和她永别。最后他说："不，太 太，我对她的爱决没有那样卑鄙下流，为了满足自己，不惜牺牲对方最珍 爱的一切。我愿为获有苏菲亚而牺牲一切，但不能牺牲苏菲亚本人。”
尽管读者或许已经察觉出这位戴假面具的人的品格并不怎么高尚，而 且她此后的行径将更显出在女人中间她决不是个十分好的，然而琼斯的这 种高贵情操确实在她心上留下了深刻的印象，因而也使她越发爱上了我们 这位年轻的主人公。
那位夫人沉默了一会儿，然后说，她倒并不认为琼斯对苏菲亚的这种 想头是不自量，不过这是很不实际的。她说："年轻人的志气总是不怕远大 的。我喜欢有雄心壮志的青年，我也希望您能尽量培养这种气概。说不定 您会在比苏菲亚阔得多的人那里获得成功哩。我甚至相信，有些女人 会……啊，琼斯先生，您不觉得我奇怪吗？怎么对一个并不熟悉的男人这 样冒昧进言呢一一何况我并没有多少可以从您的举止中感到高兴的理由！”
这时琼斯向她赔不是，希望自己所说的关于她堂妹的话，没有唐突无 礼的地方。戴假面具的人回答说："先生，难道您对我们女人家就这么一窍
不通，竟然不懂得还有比对一个女人大谈自己对另外一个女人的爱情更唐 突无礼的吗？如果天宫仙后不认为您很善于在女人面前献殷勤，她决不会 邀您在化装舞会上相会的。”
琼斯从来没有比此刻更无意去闹风流韵事的了，可是他一向认为对妇 女殷勤是保持荣誉的一个原则。他认为接受一次情场上的挑战，正像接受 一次决斗场上的挑战一样义不容辞。而且为了对苏菲亚的爱，他也非同这 位夫人保持友好关系不可，因为他相信夫人能领他见到苏菲亚的。
于是，他就对夫人最后那段话作了热烈的回答。这时，一个戴着老妪 假面具的插进来了。这种人赴化装舞会纯粹是为了发泄坏脾气，对人们说 些煞风景的老实话，也就是说，尽量叫他们玩不畅快。这位好心的太太注 意到琼斯正和她很熟悉的那位女友坐在屋角里促膝谈心，就断定再没有比 跟他们捣捣乱更过瘾的了。她就朝这两人袭来。过不久，果然就把他们从 那个隐遁的角落里赶了出来。这样她还不满足。他们躲到哪里，她就追到 哪里。后来耐廷盖尔先生看到他的伙伴的狼狈情景，替他解了围，引那老 妪追旁人去了。
当琼斯和戴假面具的为了甩掉那个捣乱者，并肩在舞厅里徘徊的时 候，他看到这位夫人一路同好几个戴假面具的人搭讪，态度随便，跟没戴 假面具一样自在。琼斯不禁感到惊奇，就说："夫人，您的识别力真厉害， 能够透过这些人的种种乔装认出他们来。"夫人回答说："你不能想象比化 装舞会在上流人心目中更平淡无味、更近于儿戏的东西了。这些人在这里 遇到，彼此像平素集会或在客厅里一样熟悉。一个有身份的女人也决不会 跟一个素昧平生的男人谈话。总之，您在这儿看到的人，可以说是大多比 在旁处更白白消磨时光；回家以后，差不多都比听了一席最冗长的说教还 要疲倦。老实说，我自己就开始有了这种感觉。如果我还有点猜测本领的 话，您的兴味大概也不比我的大。我敢说，为了您的缘故，我现在回家去 倒是做了一件好事。皿我晓得只有一件事跟那件同样好，”琼斯大声 说，"那就是准许我陪您一道回府上。""你这是看歪了我啦，"夫人说，"怎 么会以为这么萍水相逢，我就能深更半夜准许你进我的家门？我想，也许 你把我对我堂妹的关心误解成旁的动机了。老老实实招供吧：你是不是把 这次预先安排好的一次见面全然当作是幽会之约了？琼斯先生，你是不是 惯于用这种突如其来的手段征服女人夫人，"琼斯说，"我不惯于这么 突如其来地被人征服。不过，您既然这么出其不意地占据了我的心，我的
身子当然有权利跟踪着您。所以请您原谅，不论夫人到哪里去，我都决定 奉陪。”琼斯一边说，一边还有恰如其分的动作。夫人先轻轻呵斥了他两 句，说这么亲昵会引起人们注意的。然后又告诉他，她要到一个朋友家吃 晚饭，希望他不要跟到那里去，还说："要是你也跟了去，尽管我那朋友不 会见怪，可我就成了一个莫名其妙的人了。不，你还是不要陪我去。万一 你一定要陪，那我真不晓得怎么说好啦。”
随后，夫人就离开化装舞厅。尽管她严厉地不许琼斯陪她走，琼斯还 是大着胆子跟了去。这时他又面临先前我们已提到过的那个困境，也就是 说，身上一个先令也没有，而此刻又无法像先前那样向人借。于是，夫人 坐上轿子，他只好厚着脸皮尾随在后面。所有抬轿子的人都对他大声嘲笑 ――只要看到有身份的人徒步行路，他们总是想尽办法表示反对。凭琼斯 那身打扮，他本来一定会招一大帮人跟在他后面起哄的。幸而在歌剧院帮 闲的那些先生们正各自忙着本人的职务，而由于夜已深，琼斯也没在街上 遇到许多他们的伙伴。
夫人的轿子在离汉诺威广场不远的一条街上停下来。门立刻打开了， 她被抬了进去。我们这位绅士也没同谁打声招呼就跟了进去。
琼斯这时发现自己和那位女伴是在一个陈设华丽而又很暖和的房间 里。这时，那位夫人仍旧用化装舞会上的声调说，约好的那位朋友怎么不 在家呢？她一定是把约会忘掉了。说了不少气话之后，她忽然着起急来， 问琼斯倘若人们晓得她深夜单独跟一个男人在一座房子里，他们会怎么 想？对这样严重的一个问题琼斯并没作任何直接答复，他却再三要求对方 把假面具摘下来。这个要求终于实现了，不过，出现在他面前的不是费兹 帕特利太太，而是贝拉斯顿夫人。
把他们之间的交谈一五一+地叙述出来自然是无味的。谈的都是一些 平淡无奇的话，从两点一直谈到清晨六点。这里只消提提与本书有关的一 点就够了。那就是，夫人答应设法替他去找苏菲亚，并且在几天之内让他 见一面；条件是，见面之后，琼斯就和苏菲亚永别。一切商量妥当，他们 又约好当晚仍在这个地方见面，然后就分手了。夫人回府，琼斯也回到自 己的公寓。
第八章
_幅悲惨的情景，大多数读者看了都会感到十分惊异
琼斯睡了几个钟头休息过来之后，就把巴特里奇喊到跟前，递给他一 张五十镑的钞票，要他拿去兑换。巴特里奇接过票子来两眼熠熠有光。可 是寻思了一下，心里却产生一种对他的主人颇为不敬的怀疑。此外，他本 来就把化装舞会看得+分可怕，加上他主人出门和归来时都是乔装起来 的，而且走了整整一夜……打开窗子说亮话，他认为只有一个办法来解释 那张钞票的来源：抢来的。老实说，倘若读者没猜到那是出自贝拉斯顿夫 人的慷慨赠予，也会有同样的想法。
因此，为了避免玷污琼斯先生的人格，并表彰那位夫人的慷慨，我们 应说明那笔钱确实是夫人赠给他的。尽管那位夫人对当时一些极为普通的 慈善事业（诸如建造医院等等）不大肯施舍，然而在她身上并不是完全找 不到这一基督教徒的美德的。她认为（而且我看也颇有道理）这个有长处 而身上却没一个先令的青年就正好是实行这种美德的目标。
这一天，密勒太太请琼斯先生和耐廷盖尔先生吃饭。所以到了约定的 时间，两位年轻绅士和密勒太太的两位小姐就都来到客厅，他们从三点差 不多等到五点钟，才看到那位好太太。原来她出城去探望一位亲戚。回家 之后，她就这样谈起那位亲戚的情况：
"两位先生，希望你们原谅我劳你们久候。我相信只要你们晓得我耽搁 的原因，你们是会原谅我的。我是去看我的一位表妹，离这里大约六哩 路。她正坐月子。唉，这真是给所有的人……"她随说随望着女儿们，"一 个警告：结婚不可不慎重。在这个世界上，没有足够的家当就谈不上幸 福。啊，南锡！我怎么来向你描绘你那可怜的姨母的悲惨境况呢？她分娩 还不到一个星期，如今，在这个可怕的冬天，却躺在一个冰冷的房间里， 床上没有块帷幔，家里没有一点点生火的煤。她的第二个儿子，那可爱的 小东西，跟她妈挤在一张床上，喉头发着炎一一家里没有第二张床。可怜 的小汤米！南锡，他病得可重啦，恐怕你再也不用打算见到你最喜欢的这 个小家伙了。旁的孩子们身体还好。可是摩莉这孩子恐怕会把自己累坏 的。她今年才十三岁，但是我从没见过比她更勤快的一个护士。她服侍她 妈妈，又服侍她弟弟。尤其了不起的是她这么小小年纪，竟然会当着她妈 妈欢天喜地的，可是我看见她，耐廷盖尔先生，我看见这可怜的孩子转过
身来却偷偷擦着眼泪。"说到这儿，密勒太太哽咽得讲不下去了。我相信在 场的也无不陪她落了泪。最后，她镇定了一下，又这样接下去："在这么困 苦的情况下，想不到那位做妈妈的还是竭力支撑着。儿子病得那么严重， 她心里非常发愁。可是为了自己的丈夫，她还是尽量不露出来。不过有时 实在太伤心，终于压过一切努力，因为她素日十分疼爱这个孩子一一一个 很懂事、脾气又十分温和的小家伙。妈妈的眼泪落在这个还不到七岁的小 东西身上，他劝妈妈不要着急。我敢说我一辈子从没这么感动过。我听到 孩子大声说：’妈，我不会死的。万能的上帝决不会把汤米带走。不管天堂 有多么美丽，我也不愿意去，宁可在这儿陪着您和爸爸一道挨饿。’原谅 我，先生们，我实在忍不住了。"说着，她擦了擦眼睛。"一个孩子会这么 懂得体贴人，这么爱父母！但是他也许完全用不着我们可怜了，因为再过 一两天，他多半就可以摆脱人间的一切痛苦了。最值得怜悯的是那个做父 亲的。这个可怜的人脸上充满了恐怖，三分像人，七分像鬼。天哪，我刚 迈进屋子，见到一幅怎样的情景啊！这个善良人躺在床后头，服侍着他的 老婆和儿子。除了一件薄坎肩，他身上什么也没穿一一他的上衣当毯子盖 在床上了。当我走进去，他迎面站起来的时候，我简直认不出他来了。琼 斯先生，两个星期以前他还是个漂漂亮亮的人呢，耐廷盖尔先生见过他。 如今，他的眼窝陷下去了，脸色苍白，胡子老长老长的。他冷得浑身打哆 嗦，饿得憔悴不堪。我表妹说，怎么劝他也不肯吃东西。他自己小声对我 说……对我说……我真不忍心重复他的话……他说孩子们需要吃的面包， 他实在不忍心去吃。可是两位先生，你们能相信吗？尽管这么穷苦，他却 给妻子吃上好的甜酒蛋羹囹，真好像家境非常富裕似的。我尝了尝，真是再 好也没有了。那做丈夫的说，他相信这笔买甜酒的钱是一位神仙送的。我 摸不清是什么意思，也鼓不起勇气去问他什么。
"他们这场婚姻就是一般所谓'爱情的结合'，也就是说，两个叫花子的 结合。我不得不承认，这对夫妻的感情是再好不过了。可光是感情好有什 么用？还不就是彼此折磨真的，妈妈，"南锡大声说，"我一向认为再 没有比我安德生（这就是她姨父的姓氏）姨母更幸福的女人了。""我敢说 眼前这情形恰恰相反，"密勒太太说，"谁都可以看出这对夫妻最深重的痛 苦是在患难中那种彼此体贴心疼的情况。挨饿受冻还仅仅影响到他们的身 体，相形之下，要好受多了。连孩子们（除去那不到两岁的）也这么感 觉，这一家人彼此相亲相爱，他们但凡能糊口，就必是世上最幸福的家
庭。""我在他们家里从没看到过什么困苦的迹象，"南锡说，"听您说的这 些情况，我的心真快要碎了。""啊，孩子，"做母亲的说，"你姨母总是尽 量往好里做。他们的景况一向就不好。不过，他们目前落到这样的绝境， 确实是旁人造成的。你可怜的姨父曾出面把他的一个流氓弟弟从法院里保 释出来。大约一个星期以前，也就是你姨母分娩的头一天，官家把他们的 财物全拿去拍卖了。他曾托衙吏带一封信给我，可是那个坏蛋一直没交 到。一个星期以来我连个信儿也没有，他会怎么想呢？"
琼斯听密勒太太这段叙述时，眼里也不是没有泪水的。听完之后，他 把密勒太太领到另一间房去，把自己的钱袋递给她，里头有五十镑，请她 斟酌看应该送那可怜的一家多少，就送多少。此时此刻，密勒太太注视琼 斯的那副眼神，真是难以形容。她悲喜若狂地嚷道："天哪，世上能有这样 好的人吗？”但是她又冷静下来，说："我倒是晓得有一位，可是难道还有 第二位吗太太，"琼斯说，"同情旁人是很平常的事。我希望这种人世 上有许许多多，因为把同类从苦难中解救出来并不是什么了不起的事。"于 是，密勒太太取了十个基尼。琼斯劝她再多拿一些，她无论如何也不肯 了。她说明天一早就设法把钱给他们带去，并且说，她自己多少也给那些 可怜的人留下了点，现在的情形已经比她初见到他们时好了些。
然后他们就回到客厅里。耐廷盖尔表示对这不幸的一家可怕的遭遇+ 分关切；他是认识他们的，因为他在密勒太太家里不止一次见过他们。他 连声责怪替旁人担保债务太愚蠢了，然后又狠狠骂了那个做弟弟的一通， 最后表示愿意替这不幸的一家尽点力。"密勒太太，"他说，"您何不把他们 介绍给奥尔华绥先生？或者，您看替他们募点款子好不好？我诚心诚意出 一个基尼。”
密勒太太没做声。南锡听了，脸上立刻变得刷白；她母亲已经小声把 琼斯仗义疏财的事告诉她了。可是，如果母女俩生耐廷盖尔的气，也是没 有理由的。自然，纵使耐廷盖尔晓得了琼斯的慷慨举动，他也没有义务去 仿效。千千万万人连一文钱也不肯出哩。实际上，耐廷盖尔也什么都没 出，因为他并没拿出一文钱。旁人不便向他讨，他也就仍旧把钱留在口袋 里。
老实说，我已经观察到（而此刻正是我发表这个观察的最好机会）， 关于施舍，世上通常有两派恰恰相反的意见。一派似乎主张应把所有的施 舍都看作是自愿的赠与，不管施舍得多么少（即使仅仅是表示一下愿
望），也算是做了一件大好事。另一派则恰恰相反。这一派看来坚决认为 行善是人人当尽的责任。倘若在解救穷人困苦方面，一个富人远远没尽到 他所能尽的力量，那么他拿出的微不足道的赠款不但不值得表彰，从他们 仅仅尽到一半责任这一点来说，他们比那些完全漠视这一责任的人，在某 种意义上更加可鄙。
我也没有能力来调和这两派的主张。我只补充一点：施舍的人通常赞 成前一派的意见，被施舍的人则毫无例外地倾向于后者。
第九章
写的是和前一章大不相同的事
晚上，琼斯又去会贝拉斯顿夫人了。他们再度举行了漫长的谈话。但 是由于所谈的仍是那些普普通通的事，所以也就不去详细叙述了，因为我 们没办法把它描写得使读者看了愉快一一除非他是那种只有凭图画才能崇 拜女性的人，正如天主教徒对他们的圣者的崇拜一样。可是我不但不想把 这种场面展示给大家，甚至晚近某些法国小说（在翻译的名义下，这种小 说已经大批摆到我们跟前）里所描写的一些场面，我也巴不得能用帷幔把 它遮掩起来。
琼斯越来越急于见到苏菲亚。一连和贝拉斯顿夫人见了几面之后，仍 看不出靠她的帮助可能达到这一目的。（反之，近来夫人一听到他提起苏 菲亚的名字就生气。）于是，他决计另想旁的途径了。他毫不怀疑夫人晓 得他的天使在哪里，从而他料想夫人的仆人中间必有人也晓得这个秘密。 所以他就叫巴特里奇去和他们结识，以便从他们口里套出来。
再没有比这个可怜的主人当前陷入的境地更窘的了。除了寻找苏菲亚 所遇到的重重困难，担心开罪了她，以及贝拉斯顿夫人对他斩钉截铁地说 苏菲亚已下定决心不理他，说她是有意藏起来躲避他（这一点他蛮有理由 相信是真的），此外，还有一个困难是苏菲亚也无法帮他克服的（不论她 对琼斯多么同情），那就是：如果两个人不得到魏斯顿先生的同意就结 婚，势必会使苏菲亚丧失遗产继承权，而这种同意是永远也没有希望得到 的。
此外，他还欠贝拉斯顿夫人（我们已经无法再向读者隐瞒她对琼斯的 强烈喜爱）许多情分。仰赖她的资助，琼斯如今已经成为京城里衣着最讲 究的人物之一了。他不但完全摆脱了前边提过的那种可笑的拮据，而且实 际上享受到他平生从未享受过的富裕生活。
尽管世上有不少男人对于毫无报偿地把一位妇女的全部财产据为己有 这一点感到心安理得，然而在那个不应上绞刑架的人看来，我相信再没有 比只靠感恩来维持爱情更使人不安的了，尤其当男方的心别有所属的时 候。这正是琼斯目前的不幸处境。虽然他对苏菲亚的爱是坚贞不渝的，因 而不可能分出一些给另外一个女人，可是他怎样迁就也无法充分酬答贝拉 斯顿夫人对他的狂热。这位夫人当年诚然也曾是男人追逐的目标，但是如
今已经进入生命的秋天。尽管她在打扮和姿态上竭力装出青春的活泼勤 儿，她甚至千方百计地保持嫣红的面颊，可是这正像硬凭人工培育出的不 合季节的花朵，缺乏大自然在正常时令下产生的花朵所具有的那种鲜艳和 生气。此外，贝拉斯顿夫人还有某种缺陷，使得有些花朵虽然看来还颇美 丽，可是已经不宜于放在芬芳的原野上，这尤其不利于维持爱情的生命。
琼斯一方面看出种种令人扫兴的地方，另一方面仍旧深深感到自己欠 夫人的情分。同时，他也清楚地看出夫人给他那许多好处是出自一种狂烈 的情欲，自知如果不用同样狂烈的情欲去酬答，夫人必然会认为他忘恩负 义一一更糟的是，他也会认为自己是忘恩负义。他明白夫人在给他这一切 好处时不言而喻的用意。可是既然他拮据得非接受夫人的恩泽不可，那么 他认为从道义上着想，就必须付出代价。不论这样做使他多么痛苦，他都 只能如此。有些国家的法律规定凡是无力偿还债务的债户，必须给债主充 当奴才。基于这一伟大公理，他就把自己奉献给贝拉斯顿夫人了。
正当他思索这些的时候，忽然接到夫人送来的下面这一便条：
别后，发生了一件既可笑又讨厌的事，使我不便在原地会你。明日当设法另觅他地。届 时再见！
读者也许会断定，琼斯接信后并没怎么失望。即使失望的话，他也很 快就得到了宽慰，因为不到一个钟头，又送来同一笔迹的便条，里面说：
前函送出后，我又改变了主意。如果你能体会最炽热的爱情，对此改变也就不感到奇怪 了。我决定不顾任何后果，今晚在家与你相会。准七点来吧。我在外面吃饭，但届时将回到家 中。我发现在挚爱着的人心目中，一天的时光也是出乎意外地长呢。
万一你比我早到几分钟，请告诉仆人把你先引入客厅。
说老实话，在两封信之间，更使琼斯高兴的是前一封，因为后一封使 他无法接受耐廷盖尔先生殷切的邀请。他们过从很密，已经结为知友。这 位年轻绅士约琼斯当晚陪他和他约好的一些客人同看一出新上演的戏。有 几个人不喜欢这个戏的作者，所以纠合了一大帮人预备去替这次演出喝倒 彩，可是作者却是耐廷盖尔先生一个熟人的朋友。说来惭愧，从我们这位
主人公的心愿来说，他更喜欢的是参加这种有趣的事儿，然而道义却迫使 他放弃自己的爱好。
在我们陪琼斯先生赴贝拉斯顿夫人的约会之前，理应先对上面两封短 札作一些说明，否则读者可能感到有些惊讶，贝拉斯顿夫人何以如此孟 浪，竟把琼斯引到她的情敌苏菲亚所住的地方来了。
原来是这样：一向作为这对情侣幽会之处的那所房子的女主人，有几 年曾领过夫人的赡养金，近来入了卫理公会，那天早晨她跑来会见夫人， 先对夫人过去的生活情况严厉责备了一番，最后坚决表示今后再也不肯帮 她搞这种暧昧勾当了。
这件突如其来的事使夫人一时手足失措，实在想不出便于当晚和琼斯 相会的地方。不过，等到由于失望而引起的不安略微镇定下来之后，她又 动起脑筋。忽然想起一条妙计：请苏菲亚去看戏。苏菲亚答应了，又替她 找了一位适当的陪客。昂诺尔大姐和艾托芙大姐也被派去干这份愉快的差 使。这样一来，夫人就把一切安排得妥妥帖帖，静候琼斯先生驾临了。她 预计从赴宴的地方回来之后和他畅聚两三个钟头。那位朋友住得很远，在 夫人最初和琼斯幽会地方的附近一一她是在没能料到自己的那个心腹人在 思想和道德上会发生巨变之前，答应赴这次宴会的。
第一章
第十章这章虽短，却可能使有些读者的眼泪夺眶而出
琼斯先生刚穿好衣裳，正准备去拜见贝拉斯顿夫人，密勒太太来叩门 了。她被让进之后，就恳切地请琼斯到客厅里去用茶。
一走进客厅，密勒太太立刻把一个人介绍给他说："先生，这就是我那 个表妹夫。他受了您的大恩大德，如今特意登门来向您表示由衷的谢意。”
密勒太太周到地说完开场白，那人刚开口道谢，忽然他和琼斯两人彼 此凝视起来，不约而同地表现出极度的惊讶。他张口结舌，话没说完就倒 在椅子上，嚷道："原来是这么回事！ 一定是这么回事！ ”
"天哪，这是怎么啦？”密勒太太叫道，"表妹夫，你没不舒服吧？来杯 水。马上给他点提神剂！ ”
"太太，您不要着慌，"琼斯大声说，"我几乎跟您这位亲戚同样需要提 神剂。我们两个意外地在这儿遇到了，都一样吃惊。密勒太太，您这位亲 戚是我的一个熟人。"
"熟人！"那人叫道，"啊，天哪！ ”
"是的，熟人，"琼斯重复说，"而且是我所敬重的一位熟人。如果我不 能敬爱一个为了保全自己的妻子儿女免于立遭毁灭而敢于冒最大风险的男 子，那么老天爷就叫我的朋友在我落难时候不认我吧！”
"啊，您真是再好不过的一位青年了，"密勒太太大声说，"真是的，这 个可怜的人什么险都冒过啦。要不是有个头等的体格，他早就给折磨死 了。”
"表姐，"那人嚷道，这时他已经差不多完全镇定下来了，"这位就是我 向你提过的从天上降下来的福星。在我见到你以前，多亏他才保全了我的 佩吉。所有我替她弄到的那些使她安适、滋补的东西，都仰仗这位先生的 慷慨赐予。他确实是全人类最可敬、最勇敢、最高贵的。啊，表姐，我欠 这位的是怎样一种情分！”
"不要提什么情分，"琼斯急切地嚷道，"千万一个字也别提！"（我料 想，琼斯的意思是要那人不论对谁也不要泄露行劫的事。）"如果我尽的那 点薄力居然就保存了您一家，那么世上确实再也买不到代价这么低的快乐 啦。”
"啊，先生！"那人大声说，"但愿您此刻到舍下去看看。如果有谁最有 权利享受您说的那种快乐，我相信就是您自己。听我这位表姐说，她已经 把她见到的我们的痛苦处境全告诉您了。可是，先生，一切全大大改变 了，而主要是仰仗您的恩德。……孩子们已经有一张床睡了……而且他们 有……他们有……愿无限的天恩嘉奖您！……他们有面包吃了。我那小儿 子的病已经好了，老婆也脱离险境，我自己快乐极了。这一切，一切，全 多亏了您；还有我这位表姐，她是世上心肠最好的女人。真的，先生，我 一定得请您到舍下去一趟。我老婆一定得见见您，当面向您道谢。孩子们 也都要向您表示感谢……真的，先生，他们也不会不懂得欠您的情分的。 可是当我想到多亏了谁的挽救，他们今天才能够表示感激的时候，我的感 触有多么深啊！……先生，要是没有您的资助，这些颗被您温暖过来的小 小的心早就像冰一样僵冷了。”
这时，琼斯想阻止那个可怜的人不要再说下去，可是那人由于内心激 动，自己先说不出话来了。这当儿，密勒太太也以她自己和她表妹夫的名 义向他连连道谢。最后还说，她相信这样的好心肠一定会得到丰富的报 酬。
琼斯回答说，他得到的报酬已经足够丰厚了。"太太，"他说，"您这位 表妹夫刚才所说的情况，使我听了感到一种从未有过的畅快。谁要是听到 这样的叙述而还无动于衷，那必然是个没心肝的人。想到自己也有幸在这 出戏里扮演了一个角色，真是快乐无穷。世上如果竟有人不能从给旁人造 福中感到喜悦，我打心坎上可怜他们，因为这种人无法享受野心家、贪婪 者和酒色之徒永远也享受不到的那种更伟大的荣誉、更高尚的乐趣和更沁 人肺腑的喜悦。”
这时，约会的钟点到了，琼斯只好匆匆告别。临走，还是先热烈地握 了握朋友的手，表示希望尽早能再和他见面，并且答应一有工夫就亲自登 门拜访。然后，他就上了轿子会贝拉斯顿夫人去了。一路上为了自己能给 这个贫穷的家庭带来幸福而感到十分快慰，同时也不禁想到当日在旅途中 遭到袭击时，倘若他没有采取宽厚的办法，而听取了依法严办的劝告，那 后果将会有多么可怕啊！
密勒太太颂扬了琼斯一个晚上。安德生先生在热烈地和她同声称誉 中，好几回险些把行劫的那件事吐露出来。幸好他总算控制住自己，没有 失言，因为他深知密勒太太是严守礼法，一丝不苟的人。他也很清楚这位
太太喜欢饶舌。然而他对琼斯先生太感激了，几乎顾不得审慎和廉耻，宁 愿让自己的名声受到玷辱，也不愿隐瞒任何更足以充分表彰恩人美德嘉行 的情节。
第十一章
读者将会感到诧异
琼斯先生到得比约定的时刻早，因而也比贝拉斯顿夫人到的早。夫人 不但由于赴宴的地方远，而且还由于以她目前的心境来说着实感到烦恼的 其他一些倒霉的事，耽搁了。所以琼斯就被先让进客厅。不一会儿，门开 了，走进来一一不是旁人，正是苏菲亚。第一幕戏没演完，她就回来了。 前边已经提过，她看的是一出新戏，台下两大批人碰头，一批喝彩，另一 批喝倒彩，两派大声叫嚣，甚至动起手来，吓得我们的女主人公只好由一 位年轻绅士保护着，把她平安地送上了轿。
既然贝拉斯顿夫人告诉过苏菲亚她要很晚才能回来，所以苏菲亚以为 客厅里一定不会有人。她匆匆忙忙地走进来，直奔正对着她的那面镜子， 完全不曾朝客厅的上首望望；在那里，这当儿琼斯像一具塑像一样一动不 动地站着。也正是在这面镜子里，她先端详了一阵自己美丽的面庞，接着 才第一次发现了这尊塑像。她立刻转过身来，认出看到的是真人，就惊叫 —声，差点晕倒在地，琼斯好歹赶上前来把她抱住了。
要描绘这对情人中任何一个的表情或思想，我都是无能为力的。从他 们默默相对这一点来判断，两人的感受必然深得无法自己用语言来表达， 更难设想我能替他们表达。可惜的是，本书读者中间也很少有人经历过这 么深厚的爱情，足以体会到他俩此时此刻的心境。
过了一会儿，琼斯吞吞吐吐地说："小姐，看来你吃了一惊。皿吃 惊！"她回答说，"我的天！怎么能不吃惊。我几乎不能相信是你呢。""确 是这样，"他大声说，"我的苏菲亚……啊，小姐，请你原谅我这么喊你一 次。我就是那不幸的琼斯。命运叫我碰了许多次壁，终于总算把我领到你 跟前。啊，我的苏菲亚，你可晓得在这漫长的追寻，四处碰壁中，我受了 多少折磨吗？""你追的是谁呀？"苏菲亚这时心神已经镇定下来了，装出一 副矜持的态度说。"难道你忍心问我这个问题吗？”琼斯大声说，"还用得着 说，当然是你啊！""我！”苏菲亚说，"难道琼斯先生找我有这么重要的事 吗小姐，"琼斯大声说，"对有些人来说，也许是重要的。"（说着，递 给她那只皮夹子。）"小姐，我希望里面的钱没少掉分文。"苏菲亚接过皮 夹子，刚要说些什么，他又打断了她的话，说："这是命运赐给咱们的一点 宝贵时间，我恳求你，千万别错过一分一秒。啊，我的苏菲亚！我有比那
更重大的事。这里，我向你跪下求饶啦。皿求我饶恕！ ”她大声说，"先 生，就已经发生的事，和我所听到的一切，你总不能还指望我饶恕你 吧。""我真不晓得该怎么说好，"琼斯回答说，"老天爷！我已不敢指望你 会饶恕我。啊，我的苏菲亚！那么从今以后就再也不要想到我这可怜虫 吧。万一你偶尔记起我来，因而温柔的胸怀里感到些不安的话，就请你想 想我可耻的地方，用厄普顿那件事把我从你心上永远消掉吧。”
苏菲亚站在那里，浑身一直颤抖。她的脸比雪还要白，她的心在胸衣 底下起伏着。可是听到提起厄普顿来，她的双颊突然红了，一直垂视着的 眼睛，这时带着憎恶的神情朝琼斯望了一望。他懂得这是无言的谴责。于 是他就这样回答说："啊，我的苏菲亚！我唯一的爱！关于在那儿发生的 事，你怎么恨我，鄙视我，也比不上我对自己的恨和鄙视。不过还要请你 承认这一点：我的心从来也没有不忠实于你过。我所干的一切荒唐事儿都 和我的心不相干；甚至说在那时候，我的心也仍然没变过。尽管我已经没 希望再得到你，甚至再也见不到你了，可是我的心依然萦绕着你那可爱的 形影，不可能去认真爱旁的女人。而且，即使我当时并没爱着谁，在那个 该死的镇子上无意碰到的女人也决不是我正正经经恋爱的对象。亲爱的， 请相信我，从那天起我再也没见过她一面，今后也不想、不愿意再见她一 面。"其实，苏菲亚听了这番话心里是很高兴的，可是脸上却装得比刚才更 加冷漠。她说："琼斯先生，谁也没指责你这一点，你何必来辩护呢！我要 是认为值得指责你什么的话，我确实可以举出你一桩令人没法饶恕的罪 过……""是什么？请务必说吧。"琼斯脸色苍白，浑身发抖地说，估计着她 一定会提出他同贝拉斯顿夫人之间的这段韵事。"啊，能是这样吗？"苏菲 亚说，"如此高贵和如此卑劣的一切会在同一个心灵里并存！"贝拉斯顿夫 人以及自己被她豢养的这种不体面的处境又涌上他的心头，使他张口结 舌，答不出一个字儿来。"我能料到你会这么对待我吗？”苏菲亚接着说下 去，"任何绅士、任何讲求信义的人会这样对待我吗？在公共场所，在客栈 里，在最下流的粗人中间胡乱糟蹋我的名字！拿我或许一时疏忽而轻率地 对你流露出的一些温情来夸耀！甚至还听说你是为了摆脱和我的恋爱才离 乡背井的！”
苏菲亚这番话真使得琼斯再吃惊不过了。倘若她拨动的是琼斯良心上 最怕拨动的那根弦，自然他会发窘的。既然苏菲亚指责的是琼斯所没犯过 的过失，他辩解起来就没那么窘了。经过一番讯问，才晓得原来苏菲亚认
为他犯下了作践自己的爱情和她的名声这一严重罪行；那完全是出于巴特 里奇对客栈里的老板和茶房们的胡说八道，因为苏菲亚承认她是从这种人 那里听到的。琼斯没怎么费力地就使苏菲亚相信这种过失和他的性格不相 符合，是完全冤枉了他。不过，苏菲亚倒费了很大事才拦住琼斯，没让他 马上回去把巴特里奇置之死地一一他不止一次赌咒非这么做不可。这一点 解释清楚之后，两人马上情投意合，琼斯把开始谈话时他曾恳求苏菲亚永 远忘掉他的话一古脑儿忘记了，而苏菲亚此刻的心情也乐于倾听迥然不同 的一种请求：不知不觉中，琼斯说的有些话听来很像是在求婚。她回答 说，若不是她对她父亲的孝心使她不能按照自己的心意行事，她就宁愿跟 琼斯结合而毁掉一生，也不愿跟另一个人去享受荣华富贵。琼斯一听到"毁 掉”的话，立刻就大吃一惊，撒开握了好半天的苏菲亚的手，捶着自己的胸 口大声叫道："啊，苏菲亚，难道我会毁掉你！天哪，我决不能扮演这样卑 劣的角色。最亲爱的苏菲亚，不论我将付出怎样惨重的代价，我宁愿和你 诀别。我要放弃你。我要把得到你的希望从心中抛去，因为这种希望不符 合你真正的利益。我将永远保持对你的爱，可只是默默地保持着。我将远 去，在异国爱着你；我的声音，我由于绝望而发出的叹息，将永远传不到 你的耳边，搅扰你的安宁。当我死了之后……"他还要说下去，可是他的话 为苏菲亚淌在他胸前的一汪热泪止住了。她倚着琼斯的胸，什么也说不出 来。琼斯吻去她的泪水一一有一阵她听任琼斯这么吻着，丝毫也没躲闪。
过一会儿，苏菲亚清醒了些，就轻轻挣脱了他的搂抱。为了岔开这个她在 感情上受不住的微妙话题，就提出一个她刚才一直没来得及提的问题：他 是怎么到这客厅里来的？他给问得张口结舌。本来他要作出的答复很可能 会引起苏菲亚的疑心，可是恰好这时客厅的门打开了，贝拉斯顿夫人走了 进来。
她朝前走了几步，望到琼斯和苏菲亚在一起，突然站住了。她沉吟了 一下，非常机警地镇定下来，然后才开口一一尽管在声调和神情上都露出 惊骇来。她说："哦，魏斯顿小姐，我以为你看戏去了呢！ ”
虽然苏菲亚一直还没来得及问明琼斯是怎么找到她的，可是由于她一 点不摸底细，甚至不晓得琼斯和贝拉斯顿夫人相识，所以她一点也没感到 困惑；尤其因为每逢她同那位夫人谈起家庭问题时，夫人总是站在她这方 面，反对她父亲。因此，苏菲亚毫不迟疑地就把戏院里的情况以及她匆匆 离去的原因统统陈述了一番。
贝拉斯顿夫人乘苏菲亚叙述这段经过的当儿就镇定了一下心神，考虑 着下一步该怎么办。既然从苏菲亚的举止来看，琼斯大概还不曾泄她的 底，就装出一副高兴的样子说："魏斯顿小姐，我要是晓得你有客人，就决 不会贸然闯进来的。”
说这话的时候，夫人定睛望着苏菲亚。可怜这位小姐羞得面红耳赤， 张皇失措。她讷讷地回答说："我一向认为同夫人在一起总是荣幸 的……"贝拉斯顿夫人大声说："我希望至少我没打断你们两位正办的 事。""没有，夫人，"苏菲亚说，"我们已经办完了。夫人大概还记得我时 常提起把自己的皮夹子丢掉了吧，幸亏给这位先生拾到了，现在承他费心 把皮夹子连同里面的钞票一道给我送来了。”
贝拉斯顿夫人一进来，琼斯一直吓得亡魂丧胆。他坐在那里踢着自己 的脚后跟，摆弄着手指头，显得比初次被领进上流社会的年轻的土乡绅还 要蠢。可是这时他也慢慢镇定下来。他由贝拉斯顿夫人的举止中看出她并 不打算承认和他相识，于是，他自己就也装作不认得她。他说，自从他拾 到这个皮夹子，一直千方百计打听它的女主人一一皮夹子上写着小姐的名 字，幸而到今天总算找到了她。
苏菲亚倒确实向贝拉斯顿夫人提过丢皮夹子的事，可是琼斯不知怎地 却从没告诉过夫人这皮夹子是在他手里，所以对苏菲亚的话她一个字儿也 不信，并且还十分钦佩这位小姐急中生智，能编造出这么一个借口来。她 也不相信苏菲亚中途离开戏院的理由。尽管夫人没法解释这对情人是怎么 在这里遇上的，她却坚决认为这决不是出于偶然。
因此，她勉强作出笑容说道："魏斯顿小姐，你找回失款，运气可真不 坏：这笔钱不但落在一位正大光明的绅士手里，而且他还恰好发现了失主 是谁。我想你不会赞成登广告的。先生，您太幸运了，居然能找到钞票的 主人。”
"啊，夫人，"琼斯大声说，"是夹在皮夹子里的，皮夹上写着小姐的名 字。”
"那可真是万幸，"夫人嚷道，"更加万幸的是您打听出魏斯顿小姐住在 我家里一一很少人晓得这件事。”
琼斯的惶恐心情终于平定下来了。他想，眼下刚好有个机会可以间接 答复苏菲亚在贝拉斯顿夫人进来之前问的一个问题，就说："喏，夫人，我 能找到，运气真是再好不过了。那天晚上我在化装舞会上向一位夫人提起
我拾到的这件东西和它主人的名字。夫人说，她晓得魏斯顿小姐的住处， 要是我第二天早晨到她家里去一趟，她将告诉我。于是，我就照指定的时 候去了，可是她不在家。直到今天早晨我才碰到她。她指示我到夫人府 上。来到之后，我就要求会见夫人。我说有非常要紧的事情，一个仆人就 把我领到这间屋里来。没等多久，这位小姐就从戏院回来了。”
提到化装舞会时他狡猾地瞟了贝拉斯顿夫人一眼，丝毫也没担心苏菲 亚会看出来；苏菲亚显然是太惶恐了，什么也来不及去理会。这个暗示多 少使贝拉斯顿夫人感到惊慌。她没吭声。这时，琼斯看出苏菲亚心绪不 宁，就采取唯一可以宽慰她的办法：告辞而去。临走之前，他说："夫人， 每逢遇到这种场合，送回东西的人一般总该领到一份报酬。凭着我的拾金 不昧，我向您要求一份厚酬；夫人，那就是，准许我荣幸地再来拜访一 次。”
"先生，"夫人回答说，"您想必是位绅士。舍下向来对上流人总是竭诚 欢迎的。”
然后又客气了一番，琼斯就辞别了，心里自是十分满意，苏菲亚也很 快慰，因为她很担心贝拉斯顿夫人会发现真相；其实，夫人老早就很清楚 了。
在楼梯上，琼斯遇见了他的熟人昂诺尔大姐。不管她以前说过琼斯多 少坏话，此刻她却对他彬彬有礼，像是很有教养似的。这次相遇太凑巧 了，因为他把不曾留给苏菲亚的地址告诉了昂诺尔。
第十二章
第十三卷在本章里结束
那位高雅的夏弗茨贝利勋爵四曾经在什么地方反对过把真话讲得太多。 据此，我们也很可以引申来说，在某些情况下，撒谎不但是可以谅解的， 而且是值得嘉奖的。
任何人也没有在恋爱中的少女更有资格来享受这个值得嘉奖的特权。 她们还可以推说为了尊重长辈的训示、教育，尤其是礼法一一甚至可以说 是由于风俗习惯的需要，才不得不撒谎。这一切并不禁止她们顺应真实的 自然冲动（那样的禁止也是愚蠢的），而仅仅是禁止她们公开承认有那种 冲动。
因此，我们可以毫不惭愧地说，这位女主人公如今正遵循上述那位可 敬的哲学家的指点行事。她既然完全认定贝拉斯顿夫人与琼斯不相识，于 是她也就打定主意不让夫人晓得琼斯是谁；尽管要做到这一点，不免就得 撒点谎。
琼斯走后不久，贝拉斯顿夫人就嚷道："嗬，可真是个标致的小伙子。 他到底是谁？我怎么不记得曾经见过他一面哪！”
"我也不记得见过他，夫人，"苏菲亚大声说，"不过，在处理我那张钞 票这件事上，我不能不说他做得很漂亮。”
"是的，"夫人说，"而且他也是个漂亮人儿，你不这样觉得吗？"
"我倒没怎么理会，”苏菲亚回答说，"不过我觉得他有点儿笨头笨脑 的，而且也不大文雅。”
"这话对极啦，"贝拉斯顿夫人大声说，"从他的举止风度你可以看出， 他往来的不是些上流人。尽管他把你的钞票送了回来，而且不要报酬，我 甚至怀疑他不是个出身高贵的人一一我一向注意到上流人身上有一种旁的 人永远没法具备的东西。我想应该吩咐一下，等他再来的时候，就告诉他 都不在家。”
"夫人，那为什么？"苏菲亚说，"他既然拾金不昧，咱们就不应该那么 怀疑他。而且既然夫人注意到他谈吐高雅，措词委婉优美，那么，那 么……”
"我承认那家伙能说会道，"贝拉斯顿夫人说，"这一点，苏菲亚，请你 一定得原谅我……千万得原谅我。”
"我原谅您！"苏菲亚说。
"你真是得多包涵，"她笑着回答说，"因为我刚走进门的时候，曾产生 了可怕的猜疑……请你无论如何得原谅我……我怀疑那位客人就是琼斯先 生。”
"真的吗，夫人？"苏菲亚脸上红晕了，勉强笑着大声说。
"我敢起誓确实这么怀疑过，"夫人回答说，"我想不出是什么引起我这 种怀疑的，因为公平说来，那个小伙子起码还是上流人打扮。亲爱的苏 菲，你那位朋友平常大概不是这样吧？"
"贝拉斯顿夫人，"苏菲亚大声说，"我既然已经对您作下那样的诺言， 您还来这么开玩笑，真是未免太残忍啦。”
"孩子，才不呢，"夫人说，"要是先前这么说，那会显得残忍的。可是 既然你已经答应了我，不得你父亲的许可你决不嫁人一一你大概也明白， 这意思里就包含着放弃琼斯；况且作为一个乡间的年轻姑娘，你以前迷过 他一阵子是情有可原的。你告诉我如今已经一点也不迷他了，那么稍稍开 点儿玩笑总该受得住吧。要是我对他的打扮讥谓两声你都受不住，那我会 怎么想呢？我会认为你跟他的关系已经很深了，我甚至会怀疑你对我不是 开诚布公的。”
"真的，夫人，"苏菲亚大声说，"要是您以为我是替他计较什么，您可 就误会了。”
"替他计较！"夫人说，"你一定误会我的意思啦。我仅仅谈到他的打 扮……我决不愿意拿他旁的方面来比较而破坏你的审美力……亲爱的苏 菲，我不能设想你的琼斯先生就是像他那样的一个家伙……”
"我以为您似乎也同意他长得漂亮呢，"苏菲亚说。
"请问，你说的是谁？"夫人赶忙大声问道。
"琼斯先生啊，”苏菲亚回答说；然后立刻又醒悟过来，说："琼斯先 生！啊，错了，错了，夫人请原谅……我是说，刚刚来过的那位先生。”
"啊，苏菲！苏菲！"夫人嚷道，"我看这个琼斯先生还在你脑袋里打转 儿哪。”
"那么，夫人，"苏菲亚说，"我用人格担保，琼斯先生就跟刚刚离开的 那位先生一样同我毫不相干。”
"我也用人格担保，"贝拉斯顿夫人说，"我相信你这话。那么也就请你 原谅我刚才开的那一点点毫无恶意的玩笑吧。可是我答应你再也不提到他
的名字啦。”
这时，两人就分手了，苏菲亚要远比贝拉斯顿夫人高兴。夫人倘若不 是有更重要的事，她本想再多折磨这个情敌一会儿的。至于苏菲亚，她这 是生平头一遭撒谎，心里不大自在。回到房间之后，越寻思越感到无比惭 愧不安。尽管她当时的处境是困难的，撒谎也是出于万不得已，然而她仍 然没法对自己的行为感到心安理得。因为她心地纯良，不论情况如何特 殊，她也不能对弄虚作假处之泰然。这种不安的心情使她整夜也没能合上 眼睛。

两天里的事
第一章
这篇短论是想证明作家如果对自己所写的主题有一些知识，就会写 得更好一些
近来有几位先生，光凭天才的奇妙力量，完全不借助学识一一也许阅 读的能力都不大够，竟然就在文学界峥嵘头角。我听说当代批评家们最近 也断言：一切学识对于作家都是毫无用处的，只不过是束缚天赋的才华和 奔放的想象力的桎梏而已；它羁绊着作家的文思，使之无法飞翔到可能的 局度。
这套说法目前恐怕宣扬得太过火了。文学凭什么要那么大大不同于其 他各种艺术？舞蹈家丝毫不会由于学习了步法而损害到动作的矫健。我也 不相信匠人由于学习使用工具，反倒操作得更糟糕。据我看来，倘若荷马 或维吉尔不是精通他们当时的各种学问，而是像我们当代大多数作家那样 愚昧无知，他们的笔下绝不会反而有更多的文采。如果皮特［1］不曾熟读德摩 斯梯尼⑵和西塞罗的著作，并且把他们的精神（连同他们的学问）都融会到 自己的演说里去，单凭他的想象力、热情和判断力，我不相信他会做出那 样卓越的演说，使当今英国议会里显示的辩才足以与希腊、罗马媲美。
请不要以为我坚持我的同行们必须具备渊博的学识，就像西塞罗劝告 每个雄辩家应具备的那样。恰好相反，我认为诗人稍读一点书就够了，批 评家需要读的更少，政客这方面的需要则最少不过。头一类人也许只要读 毕希［3］的《诗歌的艺术》和几本当代诗人的集子就尽够了。第二种人也只需 要读几部剧本，而最后一种人，随便浏览几份政治性的期刊就行了。
老实说，我只不过要求作家对他所处理的题目多少有一些知识，就像 古代法典里所说的:Quam quisque norit artem in ea se exerceat °［4］ 只要有这点知识，作家有时就会写得很不错；而没有这点知识，不用说， 世上所有的其他知识对他都无济于事。
打个比方吧。假如荷马和维吉尔，亚里士多德和西塞罗，修昔的底斯［5］ 和李维［^］聚在一起，把他们各自的才能拼凑起来写一篇关于舞蹈艺术的论 文，我相信大家会毫不迟疑地认为他们所写的绝比不上艾赛克斯先生在这 方面的杰作：《上流社会教育入门》。老实说，倘若有人能促请卓绝一时 的布罗敦先生挥拳动笔，把他的拳击术真髓写下来，使上述的《入门》更
加齐备，那么我看世人也就不必因为古今大作家从未著书论述过这一既高 尚又有益的艺术而感到遗憾了。
为了避免在这么一个简单的问题上举例过于烦琐，现在就回到本题上 来吧。我总认为许多英国作家在描写上流社会的风俗习尚方面之所以彻底 失败，也许实际上正是由于他们对上流社会根本一无所知。
不幸许多作家是没有能力掌握这种知识的。书本只能给我们很不完备 的概念，舞台也帮不了多大忙。根据书本构成的上流绅士十之八九是书呆 子，从舞台上模拟下来的，必然是个小丑。
按着书本和舞台上的原型塑造出来的人物自然也站不住脚。范布勒［刀和 康格利夫国模仿的是自然，可是谁要再去模仿他们，就绝不会逼似目前的时 代，那正如贺加斯画街头喧闹或贵族茶会的图景而用提辛凹或范戴克四时代 的服装一样。总之，模仿旁人的作品是不行的。绘画必须以自然本身为范 本。要真正了解世界，只有靠同世人接触；要想熟悉各阶层的风尚习惯， 就必须亲眼看到。
不过这些上等人并不像其他阶层那样，不付代价就可以在坊间市井， 以及咖啡馆里看到；他们也不像某些高等动物那样公开展览，花上几个钱 就可以看一头。总之，要看到上等人，这两种资格中必须具备一种：门第 或财产，要么就是相当于这二者的一种资格一一从事赌博这个光荣行当 者。然而非常不幸，具备这种资格的人很少肯干写作这门没出息的行当 的。这通常总是出身低贱的穷小子来干的，因为许多人都认为干这一行不 需要什么本钱。
于是，在爵爷和夫人的名义下，就出现了许多身穿花边绣袄、绫罗绸 缎的怪物，男的头戴巨型假发，女的则穿着带圈箍的裙子，在舞台上昂首 阔步地踱着。池座里的律师和他们雇用的录事以及顶层楼座里的市民和他 们雇用的学徒们看了固然十分开心，然而在现实生活中，这些爵爷夫人和 半人半马、狮首羊身龙尾巴的妖精或任何其他虚构出来的动物一样是不存 在的。不过，我来向读者透露一个秘密吧。尽管为了避免闹出笑话，这种 对上等生活的了解是很必要的，可是对于一个喜剧作家或者像我眼下所写 的这种喜剧性小说的作家来说，用处并不大。
蒲伯先生论女人的话对绝大部分上等人都是适用的。说实在的，这种 人虚有其表，矫揉造作，此外一无所有，没有一点个性，至少没表现出一 点来。我敢大胆说：顶上流的社会，其生活也是顶无聊不过的，几乎没有
什么幽默或乐趣可言。下层社会的各行各业中间，倒有着多种多样富有风 趣的人物。但是在上层社会里，除了少数追逐名利的野心家和更少数的贪 图玩乐者之外，其余的都只是一味崇尚虚荣和盲目模仿。穿戴、打牌、吃 喝、鞠躬、请安就构成他们生活的全部内容。
然而这一阶层中，也有一些完全受情欲的左右，竟至远远越出礼教许 可范围的。这类人中间，妇女更是以了不起的胆大著称，抱着一种藐视声 名的高傲态度，与出身寒微的弱女子迥乎不同，正如一位品德高尚的贵族 妇女在娴静文雅方面之有别于小商人或庄稼汉的贞洁的老婆。贝拉斯顿夫 人就具有这种胆大妄为的性格。不过希望乡间读者不要因而断定上流妇女 的行径都是如此，也不要认为我们就是想把她们都描绘成这个样子。这何 异于认为屠瓦孔代表天下的教士，旗手诺塞顿代表所有当兵的呢？
更大的错误莫如一般俗人从一些浅薄无知的讽刺家那里学来的那种见 解：普遍认为荒淫无耻是我们这个时代的特征。恰恰相反，我相信，如今 发生在上等人之间的风流韵事，要比任何时代都少。当代的妇女都在母亲 的教导下，把心思全放在野心和虚荣上，而鄙视爱情的欢乐，认为那是不 值一睬的。然后她们又在母亲的精心安排下结了婚，实际上却没有丈夫也］； 她们似乎还颇相信野心和虚荣是正确的，因而也就满足于在寂寞无聊的余 生中从事一种更加天真一一但我担心也是更加幼稚的消遣。这种消遣仅仅 提一下简直就有损于这部历史的尊严。依我的拙见，当前我们的上流社会 真正的特点与其说是堕落，毋宁说是愚蠢，只配用轻浮浅薄来形容。
第二章
两封情书以及其他有关爱情的事
琼斯回家不久，就接到下面这封信:
当我发现你已离去时，真是不胜惊异。你走出房间时，我决没料到你会不再和我见一面 就离去的。你的行为是一成不变的。使我深信，对一个白痴竟至如此钟情，是十分可鄙的。我 不知是该佩服她的狡猾，还是更应佩服她的单纯。在这两方面她都是了不起的！尽管咱们之间 谈的话她一个字也听不憧，然而她却有本事，有把握，有......（怎么说好呢？）竟然当着我的 面否认她认得你，否认曾经见过你......难道这是你们俩商量好的把戏吗？难道你竟然卑劣到把 咱们的事给泄漏出去了 ？......啊，我多么鄙视她，鄙视你和整个世界呀！可是我主要鄙视的还 是我自己，因为......我不敢写出日后我重读时会使自己发疯的话。不过，你须记住，我能爱到 极点，也能恨到极点的。
琼斯还没来得及琢磨一下这封信，用同一笔迹所写的第二封信又送到 了。我们也逐字抄录如下：
倘若你理会到前一信是在怎样烦乱的心绪中草成的，对其中的任何措辞你也就不会感到 惊奇了。不过，事后我自己寻思了一下，也觉得有些话是说得过了火。如果可能的话，至少我 应当把一切都怪在那个讨厌的戏院，以及由于一个蠢人太不识相，害得我不能按时候回来上 头......谅解自己所爱的人是多么容易做到的事啊！......也许你正是愿意我如此替你设想呢。我 决定今晚非见你不可。望你速来!
再者:我已经吩咐仆人，除你外，来人概不接见。
又及：琼斯先生尽可以设想我会替他文饰一切。因为不管他怎样想欺骗我，也到不了我 想欺骗自己的程度。
又及:速来吧。
究竟是那封愠怒的信还是那封缠绵的信更引起琼斯的不安呢，这一点 就留待工于心计的人去下结论吧。可以肯定的是，除了一个人而外，琼斯 那晚并不怎么想去会任何人。但是他认为自己拘于信义，还是非去不可。 即使这个理由不够充分的话，他也不敢不去，因为他很怕把贝拉斯顿夫人 惹翻了一一根据夫人的火暴脾气，他认为这是很可能的；那样一来必然会 发生他害怕的结果：夫人把真情向苏菲亚和盘托出。他苦闷地在房里兜了 几转，正要动身前往时，夫人却善意地阻止了他一一这还不是夫人又送来
一封书信，而是夫人自己来了。她衣着凌乱、神色仓皇地走进了房间，倒 在一把椅子上，喘过一口气来才说："您看，女人要是多走出一步，她们就 再也收不住啦。一个星期之前，要是有人说我会丧魂失魄到这种地步，我 自己也不会相信。""夫人，"琼斯说，"对于您赐给我的种种恩惠，我是深 深懂得感激的。希望可爱的贝拉斯顿夫人不要轻易听信关于我的坏 话。""哦，懂得感激！"她说，"我能料到琼斯先生会对我说这种冷冰冰的 话吗对不起，亲爱的人儿，"他说，"我也不晓得自己究竟干了什么， 竟会惹得您这么怒气冲天。接到信以后，我吓得……""这么说来，难道我 是怒容满面吗？"夫人微笑着说，"我真的是带着一副训人的面孔走进来的 吗就一个男人的信誉来说，"他说，"我并没做什么值得您那样恼火的 事。您还记得您约我去相会的事吧，我只是按照您指定的时间地点去 的。""我求您不要再去背那套流水账啦，"夫人嚷道，"回答我一个问题， 我就放心了。您有没有把咱们的事泄漏给她？”琼斯双膝跪倒，对天起誓。 这时，巴特里奇乐得如醉如痴，手舞足蹈地闯进房来，一路嚷着："找到她 啦！找到她啦！先生，她在这儿，在这儿……昂诺尔大姐上楼来啦。""先 把她拦住一下，"琼斯嚷着，"夫人，快躲到床幔后边去吧，此外再也没有 旁的房间、柜橱或任何地方可以躲藏了。真是再倒霉不过。皿确实倒 霉！ ”夫人一边钻进那个藏身之所，一边说着。昂诺尔大姐随即走进来 了。"喔唷，"她说，"琼斯先生，这是怎么回事！您那个混账听差的竟敢拦 住我，不让我上楼。可别又是因为像您在厄普顿搞的那种事儿！您大概没 料到会见着我吧。可是您真的把我家小姐迷住啦。啊，可怜的小姐！说真 的，我是拿她当我的亲妹子来爱的。您要是不能做她的好丈夫，上帝决饶 不了您。当然，您要是负了心，一定会遭到恶报。"琼斯央求她小声讲话， 说隔壁有一位太太快要断气啦。“一位太太！”她嚷道，"哼，准又是您的一 位相好。啊，琼斯先生，世上这种人太多了。我相信我们就是住在这种人 家里，因为我敢说这位贝拉斯顿夫人也不是什么好货！皿轻点儿，轻点 儿，”琼斯说，"咱们说的话隔壁一个字一个字全听得见！皿我才不管它 呢，"昂诺尔大声说，"反正我又没造谁的谣。不过宅里的用人毫不忌讳地 说她在一个宅子里跟男人幽会一一那房子名义上是一个落魄的上等女人 的，房租其实由贝拉斯顿夫人出；另外，他们说，自然还给她许多好 处。"这时，琼斯表示非常不安，竭力想封住她的口。"喔唷！琼斯先生， 您得让我说呀。我又不是造谁的谣，说的全是从旁人那里听来的……我心
想，这种不义之财也不会给那位太太带来什么好处的。说真的，为人宁可 穷也要光明正大。""那些用人全是坏蛋，"琼斯大声说，"他们乱造夫人的 谣。""当然喽，当用人的全是坏蛋，我家小姐就这么说。她一个字儿也不 肯听。""那还用说，"琼斯说，"我相信我的苏菲亚决不会去听信那种下流 的谣言。""不，我相信这不是谣言，"昂诺尔嚷道，"不然的话，她干什么 在另外的地方去会男人？那干的一定不是什么好事。要是她想正正经经地 同男人谈恋爱，谁都可以合理合法地在家里接待，这算是什么意思 呢对你说，"琼斯嚷道，"我决不要听关于这样高贵的夫人的坏话，况 且她又是苏菲亚的亲戚。同时，你这样嚷，隔壁那位可怜的太太也不得安 宁。求求你啦，陪我一道下楼去吧。""不用啦，先生。您要是不许我说， 就没旁的了。喏，这是我家小姐给您写的信一一有些男人指不定肯为这么 一封信出多少钱呢。可是，琼斯先生，我并不认为您怎么慷慨。不过，我 听有些用人说……但是您总得承认，我从不曾见过您一个钱的影子。”这 时，琼斯赶忙把信接过来，然后塞给她五块金币。他又小声央求昂诺尔替 他向苏菲亚千谢万谢，同时请她快些走，好让他读那封信。昂诺尔对他的 慷慨赠予深深表示感激，随后就走了。
贝拉斯顿夫人这时从床幔后头走了出来。怎么来形容她的愤怒呢？开 头，她的舌头发不出一个音来，可是两眼冒着火，也难怪她会如此，因为 她心里烧着熊熊烈焰。等她讲得出话来的时候，她并没生昂诺尔或是她自 己用人的气，却跟可怜的琼斯大吵大闹起来。"你瞧，"她说，"我为你做了 多大的牺牲。我的名誉、体面一一都永远完蛋啦。可是你怎么报答我呢？ 为着一个乡下'|'头、一个白痴而怠慢我，藐视我。""我什么地方怠慢您， 藐视您啦？"琼斯嚷道。"琼斯先生，”她说，"掩饰也没有用。要让我放 心，你只有完全放弃她。要证明你打算这样做，那么就把她的信拿给我 看。""夫人，什么信？”琼斯说。"哦，"夫人说，"你总不至于硬不承认刚 才那个烂女人交给了你一封信吧。皿答应您这个要求，我就得丧失信 义，"琼斯大声说，"难道您愿意我不顾信义吗？我对您可曾不守信义过？ 要是我昧着良心对您出卖这个可怜的纯洁的姑娘，您又焉能保证我不会对 您自己也干出同样的勾当？您只要想一想就会相信：一个不能很妥善地替 一位妇女保守秘密的男人是世上最可鄙的坏蛋。""好吧，"她说，"既然你 这样认为，我就不去非要你当这么个可鄙的坏蛋。而且信里的话不看我也 早就晓得了。我明白你是站在什么地位上讲话了。"然后，两人又长谈一
番。读者倘非过于好奇，定然会感激我没用许多篇幅去叙述。只告诉读者 这一点就够了 ：贝拉斯顿夫人越说越心平气和了。最后她相信（或者装作 相信）了琼斯的话。他说那晚和苏菲亚相遇，纯粹出于偶然。他还谈到旁 的一些读者早已晓得的情节，这些在贝拉斯顿夫人面前都摆得十分清楚， 说明事实上她没有理由生琼斯的气。
然而对于琼斯不肯把信拿给她看这一点，她心里并不完全满意。一旦 什么思绪在人们心里占了主导位置，不管旁人用怎样响亮的理由来反驳， 也没法听得进去。当然，她完全清楚苏菲亚在琼斯心上占据着首要地位。 尽管夫人高傲而多情，她终于也不得不甘居第二位；或者用法律上的用语 说得更确切些，就是仅仅满足于暂时占有一个男人，其最终的所有权却属 于另外一个女人。
最后他们商定一个办法：琼斯此后要去夫人的府上走动，样子要做得 让苏菲亚、昂诺尔以及宅里的用人全认为他是为苏菲亚而来，而贝拉斯顿 夫人倒假装是被蒙骗了的。
这个主意是夫人想出来的，而且十分合琼斯的心意一一他着实高兴的 是这样一来，无论如何总可以见到他的苏菲亚了。夫人对于这样来哄骗苏 菲亚也颇为高兴，她估量琼斯为了保全他自己也不至于把真相泄漏给苏菲 亚。
他们还约好次日琼斯就来进行第一次造访。然后，在一番应有的礼数 之后，贝拉斯顿夫人就回府了。
第三章
包含几件事情
房里只剩下琼斯一个人了，他立刻就迫不及待地拆开那封信，里面写 着：
先生：我无法形容您走后我所遭受的痛苦。既然我已料到您会再来此地，尽管夜深，我 还是派昂诺尔（她说她晓得您的地址）前来阻止您。凭着您对我的一切关怀，我恳求您千万不 要想再来此地会我，否则真相一定会败露出来一一根据夫人的只言片语，我甚至担心她已经起 疑了。事情也许还会有转机，我们应耐心等候。但是我必须再一次恳求您，如果您稍微关怀我 的安宁的话，就千万别打算再到这里来。
这封信给予可怜的琼斯的慰藉，和当年约伯M从朋友那里得到的差不 多：不但失掉了见到苏菲亚的一切希望，而且在应付贝拉斯顿夫人方面也 陷入了进退维谷的不幸境地；因为他十分清楚有些约会是难以推辞的，而 任何压力也不能叫他去违反苏菲亚的严格禁令。整宵的思考代替了睡眠， 最后，他决定装病。他觉得只有这样才能不去赴那个他有种种理由需要避 免的约会而又不致激怒贝拉斯顿夫人。
早晨起来，第一件事就是给苏菲亚写了封回信，封在致昂诺尔的信 里。然后，他又给贝拉斯顿夫人写去一信，信中谈到上述那个借口。不 久，他收到了下面这个答复：
今天下午不能与你相会，甚为惆怅。但更令我不安的是您身体不适。望善为珍摄，请教 良医。但愿病情不致转剧。整个早晨都为蠢材们所纠缠，几乎抽不出时间来给您写信。再见。
又及:今晚九时我当设法前来看您。届时望谢却宾客。
密勒太太这时来拜访琼斯先生，寒暄了几句之后，她就说出下面这段 话来："先生，真对不起，在您生病时候来打搅。不过我希望您考虑一下， 要是一旦外面把我们这寒舍当作个不体面的地方议论起来，我女儿的名誉 一定会受到恶劣的影响。如果我要求您深夜不要在这里接待女客，希望您 别怪我唐突。昨晚来的两位，钟敲两下才走掉一位。皿太太，”琼斯 说，"请您放心，昨晚来的那位一一我说的是最后走的那位（因为另一位只
是给我送来一封信），是非常有身份的夫人，并且是我的一位近亲。""我 不晓得她多么有身份，"密勒太太说，"但是除了真正的近亲，我不相信哪 个品德端正的女人会在晚上十点来拜访一位年轻绅士，两个人单独在房间 里呆上四个钟头。同时，先生，从她的轿夫的一举一动也可以看出她是哪 一路人。他们整晚都在门口开着玩笑。我家的女用人还听见他们问巴特里 奇先生，说夫人是不是打算跟少爷度个通宵。他们还说了一大堆不好重复 的脏话。琼斯先生，我对您本人，确实是十分尊敬的。而且您对我那位表 亲仗义疏财，我还欠您很大的情分。老实说，直到最近我才晓得您对他有 多么仁厚。我决没料到贫困日子竟然把那个不幸的人逼上那样可怕的路 子。我决没料到当您交给我十个基尼的时候，您是要我把它交给一个强盗 啊！啊，天哪！您有多么仁厚呀！您把他们这一家子救活了 ！我发现，奥 尔华绥先生当年所告诉我的您的为人，一点儿也没错。其实，即使我不欠 您情分，单单就我所欠奥尔华绥先生的情分来说，我也应当十分尊敬您。 请相信我，亲爱的琼斯先生，这件事即使牵涉不到我女儿和我的名声，单 单为您本人设想，我也不愿意看到您这么一位俊秀的年轻绅士竟然去跟这 些女人往来。如果您非这样做不可，那么对不起，我只好请您换个住处。 不但我自己不愿意有人在我家里干这种事情，更重要的是为了我的两个女 儿一一天知道，除了人品，她们再没有旁的什么叫人看得起的。"琼斯听到 奥尔华绥的名字，大吃一惊，脸色都变了。"真的，密勒太太，"他有些激 动地回答说，"我不认为您这番话说得很友善。我决不想叫您府上蒙受污 名，但是我一定要在自己的房间里高兴接见谁就接见谁。要是这样会冒犯 您，那么我就尽快另找住所。""这么说来，"她说，"咱们只好分手啦。但 是我相信倘若奥尔华绥先生本人对我们这里的名声有丝毫怀疑的话，他也 决不愿再进我这家门的。""就这么办吧，太太，”琼斯说。"先生，”她 说，"我希望您不要生气，因为我决不愿意得罪奥尔华绥先生家里的任何 人。为了这件事，我整整一夜都不曾合眼。""太太，"琼斯说，"对不起， 打搅了您的清眠。不过，请您立刻把巴特里奇给我喊来。"密勒太太答应一 定照办，然后深深请了个安，就辞出了。
巴特里奇刚一进门，琼斯就向他大发雷霆。"为了你的愚蠢一一或者 说，为了我把你留在身边这件蠢事，我得吃多少次苦头啊！"琼斯说，"你 那个舌头是不是非把我毁掉不可？""先生，我怎么啦？"巴特里奇胆战心惊 地说。"谁准许你讲出那次遇劫的事一一谁叫你讲出咱们在这里见到的那个
人就是路上遇到的强盗？""先生，是我讲的吗？ ”巴特里奇说。"别再撒 谎，那就罪上加罪了，”琼斯说。"要是我真的讲过，”巴特里奇回答 说，"那也是因为我认为不会有什么害处。如果不是对他的朋友和亲戚，我 是不会提起的一一我想这些人总不会宣扬出去的。""另外你还有一件更严 重的罪过，"琼斯大声说，"既然我已经再三警告过你，你怎么竟然还敢在 这里提起奥尔华绥先生的名字？ ”巴特里奇赌了许多咒，说从来也没提 过。"那么密勒太太怎么会晓得我跟他的关系？"琼斯说，"她刚才对我说， 她尊敬我是因为奥尔华绥先生的缘故。""啊，老天爷，"巴特里奇说，"先 生，我只要求您把我的话听完。真的，这是再倒霉不过了。您只要听我讲 完，就会承认您多么冤枉我了。昨天晚上昂诺尔大姐下楼的时候，她在门 道里碰见我，问起您可曾得到奥尔华绥先生的音信。这话准是给密勒太太 听见了。昂诺尔大姐一走，她就把我喊到客厅里去。她说：’巴特里奇先 生，刚才那位太太讲的奥尔华绥先生是谁呀？是萨默塞特郡的那位大乡绅 奥尔华绥先生吗？'我说：’太太，我向您发誓，关于这件事，我什么也不晓 得。’她说：’那么你这位主人一定就是我听奥尔华绥先生说过的琼斯先生了 吧？'我又回答说：’太太，我向您发誓，关于这件事，我什么也不晓 得。’然后她转过身去对她女儿南锡说：’这么说来，就一定是那位少爷了。 他和乡绅所形容的完全一个样。’天晓得这是谁告诉她的。要是从我口里说 出去的，那么我就是天下最大的坏蛋。先生，您放心，您要我守什么秘 密，我就一定能办到。我不但没告诉她任何有关奥尔华绥先生的事，我还 对她说了相反的话。尽管我当时没否认什么，可是谚语说得好：第二次的 考虑总是最成熟的。后来我一想必然是另外有人告诉她了。我就对自己 说，一定不能让这话传开去。所以过一会儿我就又回到客厅去，我说，我 可以起誓，我说，不论哪个告诉了您，我说，这位先生就是琼斯先生一一 也就是说，我说，说这个琼斯先生就是那个琼斯先生，那人是在撒弥天大 谎。我要求您别再提这事，我说，我的主人会以为是我告诉您的。这所房 子里谁要是敢说我提过这话，我决不饶他。真的，先生，这件事来得可离 奇啦。我一直自己想着：她怎么会晓得的呢？那天我在门口看见一个老婆 子讨饭，样子跟咱们在沃里克郡见到的那个给咱们带来那么大灾害的婆子 —样。老实说，从一个老婆子面前走过去而不施舍点什么总不会有好处 的，尤其要是她用眼睛望着你一一全世界也不能使我相信这种婆子没有祸
害人的本领。我一看到个老婆子就想起Infandum, regina , jubes renovare dolorem [13]那句话。"
巴特里奇的憨态逗得琼斯哈哈大笑，他一肚子的怒气全消了一一事实 上他的怒气也总是一阵风就过去的。他没去评论巴特里奇这番辩护词的短 长，只说他打算立刻搬走，吩咐巴特里奇设法替他另外找个住所。

巴特里奇刚走，近来和琼斯先生结为挚友的耐廷盖尔先生来了。几句 客套之后就说："哦，汤姆，听说昨天深夜你房里还有客人，我敢说你可真 是个幸运的家伙，到京城还不到半个月，门口就有轿子一直伺候到凌晨两 点！"他又顺口说了一大堆这类陈腐的戏谑话。最后，琼斯打断他说："这 些话你大概都是听密勒太太讲的吧！刚才她还到这儿来给我下警告哪。这 位好太太似乎怕影响她女儿的名誉。""啊，在这类事情上她可细心啦，"耐 廷盖尔说，"你还记得吧，她怎么也不肯让南锡跟咱们一道去赴化装舞 会。""不过，平心而论，我认为她做得对，"琼斯说，"不管怎样，我认真 照她的话办了，已经打发巴特里奇去替我另外找个住所。皿要是那样的 话，"耐廷盖尔说，"我相信咱们仍然可以住在一起。我告诉你一个秘密， 可是你千万别泄漏给这一家人：我今天就打算搬到旁处去住了。""怎么， 朋友，密勒太太也对你下警告了吗？"琼斯大声嚷道。"没有，"耐廷盖尔 说，"只是这里的房间住起来不便当。而且，这一带我也住腻了。我要搬到 靠近娱乐场所的地方。所以我决定迁到帕勒墨勒。""那么你想把迁走的事 隐瞒起来吗？ ”琼斯问道。"我答应你决不赖掉房租，”耐廷盖尔回答 说，"不过我有个外人不知的隐衷，不便公开向这家告别。""外人不见得那 么不知情吧，"琼斯说，"我可以告诉你，搬到这里后第二天，我就看出来 了。你一走，这家有个人会掉眼泪的。可怜的南锡，我真替她难过！杰克 也］,你不该那么玩弄那个姑娘。你害她得了相思病，这病她再也找不到办法 治好的。"耐廷盖尔回答说："那么你究竟要我怎么办呢？难道要我娶她来 替她治相思病吗？皿不是的，”琼斯说，"我希望你不要跟她那么谈情说 爱，你有时当着我的面都那么做。我真奇怪密勒太太竟然那么盲目，一点 也没看出来。""哼，看出来！"耐廷盖尔大声说，"她有什么可看出 的喏，"琼斯说，"看出你把她的女儿迷得神魂颠倒的。那个可怜的姑 娘可是片刻也掩盖不住。她总是目不转睛地望着你。你一进屋，她脸上就 红晕起来。真的，我打心坎上同情她，因为看来她是世上最善良又最忠实 的一个姑娘。""那么，照你说来，"耐廷盖尔回答说，"一个人为了怕给女 人爱上，就连为了消遣而献点普普通通的殷勤都不成喽。皿真的，杰 克，"琼斯说，"你这是有意曲解我的话，我并不认为女人就那么容易爱上
男人。可是你所做的远远超出了献点普普通通的殷勤。""怎么，"耐廷盖尔 说，"难道你以为我们俩一道睡过觉了	我用人格向你保证，"琼斯十分
严肃地回答说，"我并没把你想得那么坏。甚至还可以对你说，我并不认为 你存心破坏这个可怜的小姑娘的安宁，或者预见到这件事的后果，因为我 相信你是一个十分忠厚的人，做不出那种伤天害理的勾当来的。可是同时 你却只求满足自己的虚荣心，并没考虑到会因此牺牲了那个可怜的姑娘。 你本来只不过想借她来消磨一下无聊的时光，然而你却在她心目中造成一 种印象，仿佛你在认真追求她。杰克，请你老实回答我：你把男女之间的 炽热感情所产生的幸福描绘得那么美妙，那么辉煌，究竟用意何在？你那 么热切地谈论自己的情思、豪迈和无私的爱又是什么用意？你没设想她会 以为这些话都是对她说的吗？或者说得更坦率些，你是否正希望如 此天哪，汤姆，"耐廷盖尔叫道，"我倒没料到你有这一手。你一定可 以做一位出色的牧师。要是南锡此刻肯跟你一道睡觉的话，你大概不干 吧！皿我当然不，”琼斯嚷道，"要是我竟做出这样的事，就叫我遭 殃。""汤姆，汤姆，"耐廷盖尔说，"昨天晚上，别忘了昨天晚上
当人们都已入睡，如水的月色
和寂寥的星儿，照耀着偷情的人。”
"耐廷盖尔先生，请你听明白，"琼斯说，"我不是假冒为善的人，我在 男女关系上并不装作比旁人干净。我承认在这方面我犯了过错，可是我想 不起曾经损害过谁，我也决不肯为了自己的快乐而故意造成旁人的痛苦。”
"好吧，”耐廷盖尔说，"我相信你。我想你也不会认为我犯了这种罪 过。”
"我衷心认为你并没存心要败坏这位姑娘，"琼斯回答说，"然而我认为 你有意要挑动她的爱情。”
"要是那样，我很抱歉，"耐廷盖尔说，"不过，分开之后，过一段时 间，这种印象自然会冲淡了。我非采取这个步骤不可，因为一一对你说实 话吧，我一辈子从没喜欢过哪个姑娘像我喜欢南锡一半的程度。汤姆，我 得告诉你一个秘密。我父亲已经替我安排好一门亲事，我还没跟这女人见 过面。她正要到京城来，父亲要我去向她求婚。”
琼斯听了这话就哈哈大笑。这时，耐廷盖尔嚷道："我求你别来嘲笑 我。我要不是给这件事逼得快要发了疯，就让魔鬼把我抓去！啊，我可怜 的南锡！啊！琼斯，琼斯！但愿我有一笔财产。”
"我也巴不得你有一笔，"琼斯大声说，"因为，照现在这情况，我打心 里替你们两个难过。你总不会打算不跟她告别就走吧？ ”
"就是给我一万镑我也不愿意去经受向她告别的那种痛苦，"耐廷盖尔 回答说，"而且我相信那么办不但不会有什么好处，还会使我可怜的南锡更 受刺激。所以我求你今天千万一个字儿也别提，我打算今晚或者明早就离 开此地。”
琼斯答应不提此事。后来想了想，还说：既然已经决计要离开她，而 且非离开不可，这样倒是万全之计。然后他又表示很愿意跟耐廷盖尔住在 一起。于是，他们就商量好由耐廷盖尔替他租到一楼或是三楼，因为这位 年轻绅士自己要住二楼。
关于这位耐廷盖尔，我们在后面还得多谈一些。他平常办事本来十分 讲信义，而且还十分诚实，在京城里的年轻绅士中间这尤其是难能可贵 的。可是在恋爱问题上他就不那么讲道德了。这并不是说他像有些绅士那 样十分放荡一一或经常装作如此，不过他对女人确实做过不忠实的事，这 是无可争辩的。他曾在所谓搞恋爱这种鬼祟勾当中玩过不少花招一一这种 花招如果应用到生意方面就会被人称作世上罪大恶极的坏蛋。
然而不知为什么，人们对这种欺诈行为看得不那么严重。他不但不因 这种罪过而感到耻辱，反而引以为荣，每每还在人前炫耀自己俘虏女人的 本领，以及他如何征服了她们的心。以前，他也曾为这种事受到过琼斯的 责备。琼斯总是十分痛恨对妇女的轻薄行为。他认为男人只应把女人看作 最亲密的朋友，以极其温柔体贴的心去结交、尊敬、抚爱她们。倘若把她 们当作敌人去征服，那样的男人不但没什么可以自豪的，倒应当感到可 耻。
第五章
密勒太太生平简述
以病人而论，琼斯这顿饭可吃了不少一一也就是说，大半月羊肩肉。 下午，密勒太太邀他去吃茶。这个好女人不知是从巴特里奇那里还是用自 然或超自然的办法探知琼斯和奥尔华绥先生的关系，无论如何她也不肯和 他这样悻悻地分手。
琼斯接受了这个邀请。茶具刚端走，两个姑娘被支出去之后，那位寡 妇没说几句开场白就这样谈了起来："喏，世界上有些事情是万万也想不到 的。奥尔华绥先生的亲属住到我这里而我居然一点也不晓得，这真是奇怪 的事。唉！先生，您决想不到那位大善人在我和我的孩子身上做了多少好 事。是的，先生，对承认这事我一点也不感到羞耻。多亏他的善心，不然 的话，我早就饿死了。那样，就只好丢下这两个可怜的东西，两个无依无 靠的孤儿，把她们交给世人去抚养一一或者不如说去蹂躏。
"先生，我应该告诉您，虽然眼下我是靠出租房子过活，可我出生在上 流人的家里，受过上层社会的教养。我父亲是个军官，死的时候军职相当 高。但是他挣多少花多少，而他一去世，军饷随着也没有了，一家人就沦 为乞丐。我们是姐妹三个。其中一个运气很好，过不久就患天花死了。一 位太太大发慈悲，把另外一个收养下来伺候她。那位太太的母亲曾经服侍 过我的祖母。她父亲开当铺赚下很大一笔产业。她继承了这笔遗产，又嫁 了一位有钱有势的绅士。这个女人虐待我姐姐，常常咒骂她的出身和贫 穷，喊她作'淑女'来嘲弄她。准是她最后逼得那个可怜的姑娘忧伤而死。一 句话，我父亲去世后不到一年，她也死了。命运对我还好一些。我丧父之 后不到一个月，就跟一位教士结了婚一一他很早就是我的情人了，我父亲 也就因为这个待他很不好。尽管我父亲没能给我们姐妹留下一个先令，可 是他却把我们养得娇滴滴的，把我们看作是（并且也要我们把自己看作 是）富家翁的继承人。可是我那亲爱的丈夫完全忘记了我父亲对他的怠 慢。我们刚一丧父，他就又来热烈地向我求婚。我一向就喜欢他，这时就 更加敬重他，所以不久我就答应了。我和这个最善良的人共同生活了五 年，直到最后，过的始终是+全十美的幸福生活。噢！残酷啊！命运真残 酷啊！它永远拆散了我们，使我失掉最温存体贴的丈夫，使我两个可怜的 女儿失掉最慈祥的父亲。啊，我可怜的女儿！她们永远也不会晓得曾经丧
失了怎样的幸福……琼斯先生，每逢一提起先夫来我就不能不落泪。这是 我们女人家的弱点，我很惭愧。""太太，"琼斯说，"应该惭愧的倒是我， 没陪您一道洒下同情之泪来。""喏，先生，"她继续说，"这样一来我又陷 入困境，而且比头一回更糟糕：因为除了丧夫的痛苦，我还得抚养这两个 孩子，所以比以前还要穷一一如果这是可能的话。那位高贵、仁厚、光辉 万丈的奥尔华绥先生跟我丈夫有过一些交往。他偶然间听说我遭到贫困， 就立刻给我写来一封信。请您看，先生，这就是。我特意把它放在口袋 里，好拿给您看。这就是那封信。先生，我一定得念给您听：
太太：
近闻府上惨遭不幸，由衷向您表示慰问。以您的高超识见，又受过尊夫的教化熏陶，这 些将远比我的劝导更足以使您节哀顺变。我素知您是最慈祥的母亲，如今可怜的遗孤唯有靠您 疼爱，深信您决不会放任自己悲痛过度，以致无法对其克尽抚育之责。
鉴于您目前可能无暇顾及物质方面的考虑，我不揣冒昧，特差人趋前致候，并先奉上二 +基尼。此款务请哂纳，余容面陈......
"先生，这封信是在我遭到那无可挽救的损失后不到两个星期就收到 的。又过了不到两个星期，奥尔华绥先生一一那得天之佑的奥尔华绥先生 就来看我了。他把我安置在这座房子里，给了我一大笔钱来置办家具，每 年还津贴我五十镑一一从那以后一直没断过。琼斯先生，请您想想看，对 这样一位救了我自己，也救了我的爱女（只有为她们，我活着才有意义） 的恩人，我该抱怎样的态度？因此，如果我劝您不要跟那些坏女人往来， 请您不要以为我是唐突无礼一一既然晓得您是奥尔华绥先生看重的人，我 对您当然也是尊敬的。您年纪还轻，她们玩的把戏您连一半也不晓得。不 要因为关于我家的名誉问题我所讲的话而生我的气。您必须了解那样一来 确实会把我可怜的女儿们毁掉的。此外，我还得告诉您，要是奥尔华绥先 生本人晓得我对这种行为（尤其和您有关）加以默许，他一定不会原谅我 的。”
"哎呀，太太，"琼斯说，"请您不必再解释了。我对您所说的丝毫没有 任何反感。可是请允许我矫正您的一点错误。我比谁都尊重奥尔华绥先
生，但我必须向您郑重保证，我不是奥尔华绥先生的什么亲属。您这个误 会对他的名誉是很不利的。”
"咳，我晓得您不是他的亲属，"她说，"我很清楚您的来历，因为奥尔 华绥先生把所有的情况都告诉我了。可是我向您保证，即使您是他的亲生 儿子，他也讲不出更怜惜器重的话来。先生，您不必为自己的出身而感到 羞耻。我敢说，任何正派人都不会因此而减少对您的敬重。不，琼斯先 生，我亲爱的丈夫也经常说：’不体面的出身'这个说法是没道理的，要用这 个字眼儿，也只能用在做父母的身上，因为在这种不体面的行为上，孩子 们是完全没有罪的，他们也丝毫不应受到玷辱。”
这时，琼斯长长叹了一口气，然后说："太太，既然看来您确实晓得 我，而奥尔华绥先生又认为可以向您提起我的名字；同时，您又把自己的 事告诉了我，那么我也把自己的一些情况再讲给您听听吧。"密勒太太热切 地表示急于想听。于是，他就把自己的全部经历都讲了出来一一可是一次 也没提到苏菲亚的名字。
在诚实人之间存在着一种共鸣，因为他们对彼此说的话都很容易坚信 不疑。密勒太太相信琼斯所讲的全是真话，对他表示了深切的同情和关 怀。她对自己所听到的开始发表意见，可是这时琼斯打断了她的话，因为 他和贝拉斯顿夫人约会的时间快到了。他向密勒太太提出再在自己的房间 里接见一次那位夫人的要求，并且保证是最后的一次。同时，他还发誓这 位夫人身份很高，而且他们决不干任何暧昧的勾当。我也确信琼斯是想恪 守自己这个诺言的。
密勒太太终于同意了。于是，琼斯回到自己的房里去，一直孤零零地 坐候到午夜，可是贝拉斯顿夫人始终也没来。
前边既然已经说过，这位夫人十分爱琼斯，从各方面看来，也确实是 这样，那么读者对她初次爽约也许会感到诧异一一她明明晓得琼斯卧床不 起，这时节正应借探病来表示一下情谊。有些人也许会责备夫人这种做法 不近人情，然而这并不是我们的过失。我们应做的只是把事情如实地记录 下来。

第六章
本章里的一个情景必定会感动所有的读者
整个前半夜琼斯先生都没合上眼。他并不是由于贝拉斯顿夫人爽约而 心神不安；尽管他常常为苏菲亚失眠，这回却也不是她驱散了他的睡眠。 琼斯心肠最为仁厚，具有通称作同情心的一切弱点。这一性格上的缺陷就 使得他与那些可敬的硬心肠的人迥然不同一一那种人自己把自己包得很 紧，宛如一只光滑的木球，无往而不如意，决不叫旁人的灾难纠缠住。现 在，琼斯不禁同情起南锡的悲惨处境来。他一眼就看出这个姑娘对耐廷盖 尔先生十分痴情，他奇怪南锡的母亲怎么一点也没察觉。头天晚上密勒太 太还一再提起她女儿的性子大大改变了，说是她从世上最活泼、最欢快的 一个姑娘，忽然变得忧郁不堪，闷闷不乐。
睡魔终于征服了一切抵抗。它仿佛就是古人想象中的一个神祇，而且 是生了气的，它正在那里耀武扬威一一抛开比喻，讲明白些，就是琼斯先 生一觉睡到第二天上午+—点。倘若不是一阵剧烈的骚动把他闹醒，他还 可以继续安睡下去哩。
他立刻把巴特里奇喊来，问他出了什么事。他说楼下掀起了一场可怕 的风暴，南锡小姐晕倒了，她母亲和妹妹正为这件事哭和哀叹呢。琼斯听 了这消息很着急。巴特里奇尽量宽慰他，笑着说，那位小姐不会有生命危 险，因为苏珊（这是那女仆的名字）告诉他这是很平常的事儿。"一句 话，"他说，"南锡小姐跟她母亲一样机灵一一如此而已。她有点儿饿了， 没念祷文就坐下来吃饭，所以育婴堂里又要添个娃娃。""住嘴，不许开这 种愚蠢的玩笑，"琼斯嚷道，"难道这些人所遭遇的不幸可以当作开玩笑的 题目吗？立刻去密勒太太那里，告诉她……别去，你一定又瞎说八道。还 是我自己去吧，她请我吃早饭呢。"琼斯于是爬起来，尽快地穿上衣服。这 当儿，尽管琼斯狠狠责备了他好多句，巴特里奇仍然针对这件事说了一些 通常称作诙谐的毫无心肝的话。琼斯穿好衣服，立刻就走下楼去，敲了敲 密勒太太的门。女仆把他让进外间的客厅，可是里边没有人，也没摆任何 餐具。密勒太太和她的女儿正在里间。过了一会儿，女仆出来转告琼斯先 生，说她家女主人很抱歉，由于一件意料不到的事，今天不能共进早餐 了，并且请他原谅，没能早些通知他。琼斯请女仆转达给密勒太太，请她
不要为爽约这点区区小事感到不安。他衷心为她所遭到的意外而难过，说 如果有他可以效劳之处，希望她吩咐。
他这话刚说完，在里边全听到了的密勒太太忽然推开门，眼泪汪汪地 走到琼斯跟前说："啊，琼斯先生！您真是天地间再好不过的一位青年。您 表示愿意帮我的忙，我是千恩万谢，可是，先生，您是没法来保全我可怜 的姑娘了。啊，我的孩子！我的孩子！她这一生毁了。永远毁掉啦！""太 太，"琼斯说，"但愿不是什么坏人……""啊，琼斯先生！"她说，"正是昨 天搬走的那个坏人把我这个可怜的孩子毁了……把她糟蹋了。我晓得您是 讲究信义的。琼斯先生，您有一颗善良一一高贵的心。只有这样的心，才 能使您做出我亲自看到的那种行动。事到如今，反正瞒也瞒不住了，我把 情况全部告诉您吧。那个耐廷盖尔，那个人面兽心的坏蛋，把我的女儿糟 蹋啦。她……她……唉！琼斯先生，耐廷盖尔叫她怀了孕，他就那么把她 遗弃了。这，这就是他那封残酷的信。琼斯先生，您看看吧。然后告诉我 天下可有比这更没心肝的恶人。”
下面就是那封信：
亲爱的南锡：
目前所发生的事，使我受到的震惊决不下于你。由于我实在无法当面同你谈，所以只好这样书 面告知。家父坚决要我向一位富家小姐去求婚，他已经选定她为我的......我不必写出那个讨厌 的字眼了。你是通情达理的，定能明白我只有唯父命是从，今后再也无法回到你的怀抱。令堂 为人慈祥，你谅必可以把我们一场欢爱所产生的不幸的结晶委托给她。将此事隐瞒起来谅不困 难，因我当负你及婴儿赡养之全责。为此，我希望你的心境可以比我的好受一些。总之，你务 必以最大之坚忍承受一切，原谅我，并且永远忘掉我。倘若我不是面临必然的毁灭，我决不会 给你写此信。当我要你忘掉我时，我指的只是我们爱情的关系。但我将永远是你忠实然而不幸 的挚友。
杰,耐廷盖尔
琼斯读完这封信后，他俩互相望着，默默地站了好一会儿。最后，琼 斯这样说道："太太，我真没法儿向您形容这封信使我受到多么大的震动。 可是有一点我恳求您听取这个写信人的劝告：要为令媛的名誉着 想。""唉，琼斯先生，"她嚷道，"她的名誉早丢尽了，跟她的贞操一道完 啦。她是在房里满是客人的时候收到这封信的。信一拆开，她立刻就晕倒
了。信里讲的事，在场的个个全晓得了。名誉扫地已经够糟的了，可这还 不是最糟的一一我还要失掉我的女儿。她已经寻过两次短见啦。尽管两次 都给拦住了，可是她发誓决不活着丢这个脸一一如果她出了这种事，我也 活不下去的。可是丢下我可怜的小贝特西四怎么好呢，一个无依无靠的孤 儿！我相信那个可怜的小东西看到她姐姐和我这么心神错乱，也一定会十 分痛苦的一一她并不晓得家里出了什么事。啊，贝特西是个很懂事、心地 十分善良的小东西。那个残忍的、没心肝的……把我们一家子全害了。
啊，我可怜的孩子！难道这就是我抚养她们一场的报酬？这就是我殷切期 望的结果？我是那么欣然地尽到了做母亲的一切职责，小的时候细心抚养 她们，时刻注意对她们的教育；多年来我辛辛苦苦操劳，自己省吃俭用来 维持她们的饱暖，到头来难道就是这么把她们中间的一个或者甚至两个都 这么葬送掉吗太太，"琼斯噙着眼泪说，"我打心坎上同情您。""啊！ 琼斯先生，”她说，"尽管我晓得您有多么仁厚，连您也不会了解我的心 境。我这两个女儿是世上最好、最善良、最孝顺的孩子。啊，我可怜的南 锡！我的心肝宝贝！我眼里的珍宝！我心中的骄傲！也许我过于为她自豪 了，正由于她生得美，使我愚蠢地在她身上抱着奢望，结果毁了她。哎！ 当我看到这个年轻人喜欢她的时候，我是满心高兴的。我以为那是一种光 明正大的感情，愚蠢的虚荣心促使我去高攀，一心巴望南锡能嫁一个身份 远远高于她的丈夫。耐廷盖尔无数次当着我面一一往往还当着您的面，大 谈慷慨无私的爱，而且总是针对我可怜的女儿。我们母女把这些话都看作 真情实意了，这样也就使我更加坦然地抱起那种奢望。哪里会料到那些言 词只不过是败坏我的孩子的清白、毁掉我们一家的圈套！"正说到这里，小 贝特西跑进房来，嚷道："亲爱的妈妈，您千万快来看我姐姐，她的病又犯 了，表姐拽不住她。"密勒太太马上赶去。走前先吩咐贝特西留在琼斯先生 身边，求琼斯陪她一下。密勒太太用十分凄怆的声调说："老天爷！至少叫 我保住一个女儿吧。”
琼斯就按照这一要求，竭力宽慰这个小姑娘一一其实，听了密勒太太 这段叙述，他自己也非常难过。琼斯告诉贝特西说，她姐姐很快就会好 的。她要是太伤心，就不但会叫她姐姐病得更厉害，还会把她妈妈也急病 了。"先生，"贝特西说，"我决不会做出任何叫她们着急的事来。我宁可自 己的心碎了，也不让她们看到我的眼泪。可是我可怜的姐姐看不到我哭 了。恐怕她永远也看不到我哭了。我实在离不开她，真的不能。……而且
可怜的妈妈，要是没了姐姐可怎么好！她说她自己也死，把我丢下。可是 我决不一个人留下来。""我的小贝特西，你不怕死吗？”琼斯说。"以前我 总是怕死的，"贝特西回答说，"因为一死就得离开我妈妈和姐姐。要是跟 我所爱的人一道走，随便去哪里我也不会害怕的。”
琼斯听了这个回答十分高兴，就热烈地吻了这个孩子一下。不一会 儿，密勒太太回来了，说是谢天谢地，南锡清醒过来了。她说："喂，贝特 西，你姐姐好些了，你进去看看吧，她非常想看到你。"然后她又转过身 来，再一次向琼斯道歉没能请他吃早饭的事。
"太太，”琼斯说，"我希望将来会享受到比您所能备办的更丰富的宴 席。您可以相信，倘若我能为您这个相亲相爱的小小家庭尽到一份力量， 那就是我的盛宴了。不管成功的希望有多少，我一定要去试试看。尽管发 生了这件事，倘若耐廷盖尔先生根本是铁石心肠，对令媛也没什么深情， 那么我就是看错了人。不然的话，我相信等我把这儿的情景向他一形容， 一定会感动他的。太太，您尽量宽慰您自己和南锡小姐吧。我马上找耐廷 盖尔先生去。我希望给您带来好消息。”
密勒太太跪下来，祈求上天降福给琼斯先生，然后又说了许多感激涕 零的话。于是，琼斯找耐廷盖尔先生去了，这位好妇人就回到她女儿身边 来宽慰她。南锡听到她母亲说的话，心里也快活了一些，母女交口称赞琼 斯先生。
第七章
琼斯先生和耐廷盖尔先生会晤
我相信我们对旁人积的德或造的孽，往往会回到我们自己身上来。正 如善良人在施惠于人的时候会和受惠者同样感到愉快，恶人中间也很少有 恶到良心上不为他们损害同类的劣行而略微感到刺痛的。
至少耐廷盖尔先生不是这种人。恰恰相反，琼斯先生来到他的新居的 时候，看到他正愁眉不展地坐在炉畔，为他的可怜的南锡陷入那样不幸的 境地而叹息。他一看到朋友来了，就赶忙迎上前来。寒暄了好几句之后， 他说："承你来访，真是再好不过了。我生平从没像目前这样苦恼过。”
"对不起，"琼斯回答说，"我带来的消息也决不能叫你宽心。我相信你 听了一定会大为震动。然而我必须把情况告诉你。旁的不说啦，那么，耐 廷盖尔先生，我这是从一个可尊敬的家庭来的，那个家庭被你投进了灾难 的深渊，面临着毁灭。"耐廷盖尔先生一听这话，脸上变了色。可是琼斯没 有理会，仍然有声有色地形容了读者在前一章里已经看到的惨景。
耐廷盖尔尽管多次心里十分激动，但他一次也不曾插嘴。琼斯说完之 后，耐廷盖尔深深叹口气说："朋友，你叙述的情景，我听了万分难过。最 不幸的是那可怜的姑娘泄露了我的信。不然的话，她的名誉也许可以保全 下来的，我们这件事也许可以瞒得人不知鬼不晓，那样，说不定这姑娘的 前途丝毫受不到影响一一京城里这类事儿多得很呢。万一她嫁的丈夫日后 有些怀疑的话，那也晚了 ；聪明的，倒宁可不向他的妻子或外人声张。”
"真的，朋友，"琼斯回答说，"可怜的南锡的情况却不是这样。你已经 使她全心全意地爱上了你。使她痛苦，使她和她全家同归于尽的，不是由 于她丧失了自己的名誉，而是由于丧失了你。""不，说到爱情，"耐廷盖尔 大声说，"你可以放心，我的心也是完全属于她的。不管将来我娶过谁来， 她也占有不了我的心。皿那么你忍心就这么把南锡扔掉吗？ ”琼斯问 道。"不那样又有什么办法呢？”对方回答说。"这你要问问南锡小姐，"琼 斯恼火地驳他说，"既然你把她害到这步田地，我确实认为应该由她来决定 你怎么补偿。你唯一应当考虑的是南锡的利益，不是你自己的。倘若你问 我该怎么办，我认为你至少应该实现她和她一家的期望一一而且老实告诉 你，自从那天我初次看到你同南锡在一起那么亲昵，这也是我自己的期 望。我对这可怜的一家抱着满腔的同情。恕我仗着我们的友谊，这样向你
冒昧进言。你可以扪心自问，当初你的种种做法是不是要她们母女相信你 的用意是光明正大的。如果是这样的话，那么就请你凭着自己的好见识考 虑一下：即便你没有直接答应要娶南锡，从道义上说你至少应该怎样做才 对。”
"我不但得承认你不便明说的那一切都是事实，"耐廷盖尔说，"我甚至 曾作过婚娶的诺言。""既然这样，"琼斯说，"那么你还能再有片刻的踌躇 吗想想看，朋友，"耐廷盖尔说，"我晓得你是讲体面的人，决不会劝 人去做有损体面的事。那么即使没有旁的问题，仅仅从她公开丢了脸这一 点来说，我再去结这门亲还能有什么体面呢？""当然有体面喽，"琼斯回答 说，"最光彩、最真实的体面一一也就是说，善行，要求你这样做。既然你 提到体面问题，那么就让我来分析一下。你用假言假语诳骗了一位年轻姑 娘和她一家，并且用这种阴险的手段剥夺了她的清白，难道这有什么体面 吗？你有意地、存心不良地一一甚至是诡计多端地毁掉一个同类，难道这 有什么体面？你破坏了这个人的名誉、宁静一一说不定还将破坏她的肉体 和灵魂，这难道有什么体面？想到这是位多情的、孤苦伶仃的年轻姑娘， 一个讲究体面的人能无动于衷吗？这位姑娘爱你，对你痴情，她甚至为你 而死；她对你所做的一切诺言深信不疑，由于这种信赖，她牺牲了自己所 珍爱的一切。想到这些，一个讲究体面的人良心上能有片刻安宁吗？"
"就一般道理而论，”耐廷盖尔说，"你这话当然不错。然而你也很清 楚，世人并不这么看。我要是娶个婊子，尽管是我叫这姑娘当上婊子的， 可我仍然没脸见人。”
"胡扯，耐廷盖尔先生！"琼斯说，"你别把这种侮辱字眼用在她身上。 是你答应娶她，她才成为你的妻子的。她的过失与其说是不贞，不如说是 有失检点。你所不敢面对的世界，还不都是些邪恶、愚蠢、荒淫无耻的 人!请原谅我这么指出：你说没脸见人，这是出于虚伪的爱面子一一而这 种感觉和虚伪的体面总是形影不离的。可是我坚决相信如果你娶了南锡， 世上凡是善良的有见识的人，没有一个会不赞扬，不为你喝彩的。先不说 旁人，朋友，难道你自己的良心不为你喝彩吗？当我们由于做了一件诚 实、高贵、豪迈、仁厚的事而产生一种热烈、喜悦的感觉时，难道那不比 来自几百万人的、受之有愧的赞扬更使我们快慰？衡量一下两种做法的后 果吧。一种是：那不幸的、多情的、轻易相信了你的女孩子倒在她那苦命 的妈妈怀里，咽着最后一口气；在这痛苦的弥留中，她依然唤着你的名
字，哀叹着（而不是控诉着）由于你的残忍而使得她一步步接近了毁灭。 你再设想一下那位钟爱自己的女儿因而也陷入绝境的母亲吧，由于失掉了 可爱的女儿，她会被逼得发疯，甚至会死。再看看那孤苦伶仃的可怜的婴 儿。你只消想想这些情况，再考虑一下你自己正是这个贫寒、无依无靠而 又值得尊敬的小小家庭所遭受的一切灾难的根源。反过来说，假使你自己 把这一家从她们眼前的苦难中拯救过来。想想看，那可爱的人儿将带着怎 样的喜悦心情奔到你的怀抱中来。你可以看到她那苍白的面庞又红润起 来，呆滞的眼睛又神采奕奕了，她那凄楚的心境也会快活起来。想想看她 母亲将会多么欢天喜地，这一家将会多么幸福。想想看，你这一举可以使 这个小小家庭的幸福变得多么美满。把这二者比较一下：究竟是让这一家 永沉苦海呢，还是做出一个豪迈、高贵的决定，把她们从灾难和绝望的边 缘升到人间幸福的顶巅。倘若在这种抉择面前你还举棋不定的话，那我可 真的认错你了。除此之外，还要再加上一层：想想看，这是你义不容辞的 事，因为需要你来解救的苦难正是你自己有意加到她们身上的。”
"啊，亲爱的朋友！ ”耐廷盖尔嚷道，"用不着你这番高谈阔论来激发 我。我由心坎上同情可怜的南锡。要是能够勾销我们之间那段亲密关系的 话，什么代价我也愿意出。请你相信，在动手写造成这不幸的一家如此痛 苦的那封残忍的信之前，我也和自己的情感作过不少挣扎。要是我可以自 作主张的话，我愿意明天早晨就和她结婚。对天发誓，我一定会的！但是 你不难理解要我父亲同意这样一门亲事是多么不可能。而且他又另外替我 张罗好一门亲事，明天我就奉他的紧急命令去见那位小姐啦。”
"我还无缘拜识令尊，"琼斯说，"不过，假若可以把他劝服的话，你肯 不肯采取那唯一能保全这可怜的一家的步骤呢？""当然肯，"耐廷盖尔回答 说，"而且就像我在谋求个人幸福时那么急切，因为除了南锡，和任何旁的 女人在一起我都不会幸福的。啊，亲爱的朋友！倘若你能体会到这十二个 钟头里我为着我那可怜的姑娘而感到的痛苦，你就不会仅仅同情她一个人 了。情感上我只爱她一人。要是我在体面上有些糊涂的顾虑的话，你已经 替我完全打消了。只要能促使我父亲按照我的心意办事，那么我本人的以 及南锡的幸福就可以圆满了。”
"那么我决定去奔走一趟，"琼斯说，"像你和南锡之间的这种事，总是 很快就传出去的一一不幸，现在已经传出去了。你也没法长期瞒住令尊。 因此，我打算根据情势的需要，该怎么向他谈这件事就怎么谈，希望你不
要生我的气。同时，倘若发生了什么不幸（如果不想法防止，我实在担心 会发生不幸的），你将弄得声名狼藉；令尊如果有几分仁慈心的话，定然 也会感到愤怒的。因此，倘若你告诉我哪里可以找到老人家，我立刻就去 办这件事。在我奔走的时候，你可以做一件最仁厚的事：去拜访一下那位 可怜的姑娘。你会发现刚才我向你描绘的那一家人的悲惨景象是一点也没 夸大的。”
耐廷盖尔立刻同意了这个建议。他对琼斯说了他父亲的住所和很可能 在那儿找到他的一家咖啡馆。然后，沉吟了片刻，又说："亲爱的汤姆，你 现在去办的是一件不可能办成功的事。倘若你晓得我父亲的为人，你就不 会指望他同意这件事……等等看，有个办法……要是你告诉他我已经结了 婚，叫他容忍一件木已成舟的事也许还容易一些。说良心话，你讲的情况 真叫我感动。我深深地爱我的南锡，巴不得此刻已经娶了她，不管会有怎 样的后果。”
琼斯非常赞成这个主意，答应一定照办。然后，他们分了手。耐廷盖 尔去看他的南锡，琼斯就去找那位老先生。
第八章
琼斯和老耐廷盖尔先生晤谈的经过;本书一直还没提过的一个人出 场
尽管一位罗马讽刺家也否认有个司命运的神祇，塞涅卡也抱有同样的见 解；可是我相信西塞罗比他们两人都更聪明些，他明确地持相反的看法。 生活里有些事情确实离奇古怪，无法解释，似乎不是凡人的能力和先见之 明所能办到的。
琼斯碰上的刚好就是这种情况。在一个如此紧要的关头，琼斯找到了 老耐廷盖尔先生。即使命运女神真配享受她在罗马所受到的供奉以的话，也 不能安排得比这更微妙了。一句话，老先生跟他想娶的那位儿媳妇的父亲 方才卖力地谈判了几个钟头。那位客人走了没多久，老耐廷盖尔先生正惬 意地回味自己跟这位未来的亲家翁长时间谈判获得的成功一一双方都力图 占对方的便宜，而正像这种谈判往往发生的情况，双方事后都认为自己是 胜利者。
琼斯先生此刻前来拜访的这位先生，是所谓老于世故者一一即是说， 此人在处世方面依照这样一种原则：他肯定相信除了尘世之外并无所谓另 一世界，他立志在现世能捞多少就捞多少。他早年经商，而积攒下万贯家 资以后，近来他不大做生意了一一或者说得更恰当些，他不再经营货物， 只经营银钱了。他手里总有一大笔资金，他十分晓得怎样有时利用私人的 急需，有时利用公家的急需，大发其财。他那样专门和金钱打交道，使人 几乎怀疑在他心目中，金钱之外是否还有别的什么东西存在。起码可以这 样说：他坚决相信旁的一切都没有任何真正的价值。
我想读者一定会同意，命运女神不可能替琼斯先生挑选一个更难对付 的人，以使他没有取得成功的任何希望了。这位任性的女神也不可能挑选 一个更不相宜的时机让琼斯来办这一交涉。
既然钱财在这位先生的头脑里总是居于至高无上的地位，因此，他一 看到有个陌生人走了进来，就立刻想：此人不是送钱来，就是来拿钱的。 他对来访的人怀好感还是恶感，就看哪种估计占上风。
对琼斯说来很不幸，那位先生见到他的时候，脑子里占上风的是后一 种估计。因为头一天刚刚来过一位年轻人，带着他儿子的字据来见他，向 他索取一笔赌债，所以一瞥见琼斯，他立刻以为也是来讨债的。因此，琼
斯刚一说他是为令郎的事情而来，老先生就认为果然猜得不差。于是，他 咆哮道："你来也是白搭。""先生，"琼斯说，"难道您已经猜出我的来意了 吗要是我猜中了的话，"老先生说，"我再说一遍，你也是白跑一趟。 哼，我看正是你这种花花公子引诱我的儿子去吃喝嫖赌，将来势必把他毁 掉。可是我告诉你，我再也不替他付这种欠账啦。我希望此后他不再跟你 们这种人在一起混。我要不是这么打算的话，也就不会替他找个老婆了 ――我决不去害人家一辈子。""哦，先生，"琼斯说，"那么这位小姐是您 给他找的吗？皿请问，先生，"老先生回答说，"这跟你有什么关 系不，亲爱的先生，"琼斯回答说，"如果我过问一下与令郎的幸福有 关的事，请别生我的气，因为我+分敬重他。我正是为这件事来拜访您 的。我没法形容我对您刚才所说的话有多么满意；请您相信，我确实非常 尊敬令郎。先生，我也不晓得该怎样来表达我对您的仰慕，您是这样慷 慨、善良、好心肠，这么宽厚，为令郎办下这样一门亲事。我敢发誓：这 位小姐一定会使他成为世上最幸福的男子。”
最能促使我们喜欢上一个人的，莫如他刚出现时曾略微引起的惊吓； 疑虑一旦开始消失，我们很快就忘记它所造成的恐惧，并把当前的松快归 功于那个最初曾使我们害怕的人。
老耐廷盖尔就是这样。他一发现琼斯并非像他所猜想的要来向他讨什 么，就立刻对他表示了欢迎。"我的好先生，"他说，"请坐。我不记得曾经 会过您。不过，您既是我儿的朋友，想来谈谈这位小姐的事情，我当然很 乐意领教。如果这位小姐还不能使我的儿子幸福，那就只有怪他自己。主 要条款我都再三斟酌了，总算尽到了我的责任。她将带过来的那份家当足 以使任何通情达理、谦恭谨慎的男人心满意足。""自然是这样，"琼斯大声 说，"因为她本人就是一份家当一一长得那么美，举止那么文雅，性子那么 温柔，又有那么好的教养。她真是一位多才多艺的姑娘，唱得很不错，还 弹得一手好琴。""这些情况我倒还不知道呢，"老先生回答说，"因为我从 来也没见过这位小姐。不过，听了您讲的这些，我还是照样喜欢她。同 时，她父亲在跟我谈判的时候没强调这些优点，这也更加使我高兴。我认 为这足以证明他很有见识。要是碰上个笨蛋，他就会在财产之外，把这些 优点也附加上去。不过，说句公道话，他一直也没提过这些；尽管这些并 不会贬低这位小姐的身价。""我可以向您保证，"琼斯大声说，"所有她这 些优点都是十分卓越的。至于我，我承认曾经担心您会犹豫不决，不大愿
意结这门亲事，因为令郎告诉我，您和这位小姐从来还没见过面呢。如果 是那样，那么我就来恳切地央求您，既然您这样珍视令郎的幸福，就不要 反对他娶一位不仅具备了我提到的许多优点，还有更多的优点的小 姐。""先生，如果您是为此而来，"老先生说，"我们父子非常感激您。您 可以完全放心，因为我对她拥有的财产非常满意。""先生，"琼斯说，"越 谈我越佩服您了。您是那么容易满意，要求一点也不高，这足以证明您胸 襟高尚，有真知灼见。""我的要求可也不算低呢，年轻的绅士，并不算低 呀，"那个做父亲的说。"那就更高尚了，"琼斯说，"而且，请允许我再补 充一句：还很有见识，因为如果把金钱作为幸福的唯一基础，那可说是丧 心病狂。像这样一位财产很少，甚至没有财产的姑娘……""我觉得足下对 这位小姐的家当估计得未必公道，"老绅士大声说，"朋友，也许您对她本 人了解得比她的家境更清楚吧。请问，您估计这位小姐的家当有多 大什么家当？"琼斯嚷道，"那对令郎来说真是不值一提。""哦，哦， 哦，"老绅士说，"也许他能找到一位更好的。""这我认为是不可能的，"琼 斯说，"因为再也没有比这位小姐更好的了。""对，对，"对方说，"不过我 说的只是陪嫁。这方面，您估计我儿子可以拿到多少多少？"琼斯大声 说，"多少？我看，顶多也就两百镑。""年轻人，”那做父亲的有点生气地 说，"您是来跟我开玩笑的吗决不是，"琼斯回答说，"我是诚心诚意 的，并且我已经把那个数目说到头儿啦。如果我委屈了那位小姐，就请她 原谅。""您真的委屈她了，"老先生大声说，"我确实晓得她的财产比您说 的要多上五十倍，而且她一定得在婚前拿出那五十倍来，我才会同意娶她 作儿媳。""不，"琼斯说，"此刻来谈同不同意已经来不及了。她就是连五 十个小钱也没有，反正令郎也已经结婚啦。""我儿子结婚啦！"老先生吃惊 地嚷道。"啊，我以为您晓得了呢！”琼斯说。"我儿子已经娶了哈丽思小 姐！"老耐廷盖尔又说。"娶哈丽思小姐？"琼斯说，"不，先生，娶下南锡, 密勒小姐了一一就是他的房东密勒太太的女儿。尽管这位小姐的母亲落魄 到经营公寓……""你是在开玩笑还是在说正经话？"老先生用极其庄重的声 调嚷道。"真的，先生，"琼斯回答说，"我最瞧不起开玩笑的人。我是满怀 诚意来拜访您的。我早就估计（而且果不出我所料）到令郎决不敢告诉您 他已经娶了一位在家当上远不如他的小姐一一尽管为了这位小姐的名誉， 不允许他再把这件事瞒下去了。”
正当这位做父亲的听了这个消息惊得目瞪口呆的时候，一位先生走进 来，称他作"哥哥"，向他问候。
尽管这两个人在血缘上是如此相近，在性格上他们却几乎完全相反。 刚进来的他这位弟弟也是从小经商的，可是他赚到六千镑后，立即用这笔 钱的一大部分买了一小片田产，然后就隐居乡间，娶了一个不享受教产四的 牧师的女儿。这位姑娘虽然既不漂亮，又没有财产，可是脾气极好，也就 是完全凭这一点才被他看上了。
他同这个女人一道度过了二十五个年头。他们所过的与其说像当代那 些类型的生活，毋宁说是像某些诗人笔下的黄金时代那种生活。她为他生 了四个孩子，除了一个女儿，其余的都夭折了。这女儿，正像平常所说 的，被他们夫妇惯坏了：他们对她溺爱之极，她对他们的报答是：当她有 机会和一个刚过四+的绅士结下一门+分好的亲事的时候，她竟然拒绝 了，因为舍不得离开父母。
耐廷盖尔先生想替他儿子娶的这位小姐是他弟弟的近邻，跟他侄女相 识。实际上，耐廷盖尔先生的弟弟这番来京城正是为了这门亲事；不是来 促成其事，而是来劝阻他哥哥不要再进行下去，因为他看出尽管哈丽思小 姐很阔，然而不论她的姿容或头脑都无法保证婚后两人能够过得幸福，因 为她很高、很瘦，很丑，很好装模作样，很蠢，脾气又很坏。
因此，一听哥哥说到侄子娶了密勒小姐，他立刻就表示十分满意。在 做父亲的痛骂自己的儿子，并且宣布让他从此去讨饭的时候，做叔叔的却 说了这样一番话：
"哥哥，要是你冷静一些，我就想问问你：你爱儿子是为儿子好，还是 为你自己好？我想你一定会回答，也一定认为：是为他。没疑问，你进行 这门亲事是为了他的幸福。
"可是，哥哥，我一向认为替旁人规定一些幸福的原则是十分荒谬的， 而坚持非这么办不可，是非常专横的。我晓得这是一个许多人常犯的过 错，然而那仍然是个过错。如果在旁的事情上这么做是荒谬的，那么在婚 姻大事上这么做就更加荒谬，因为夫妻间的幸福完全系于双方的感情。
"所以我总认为父母替子女包办婚姻是没有道理的，因为感情是不能硬 逼出来的。甚至可以说，爱情是如此之厌恶强制，也许这是由于我们天性 中那种不幸然而又无法矫正的执拗，它连劝说之词也听不进去。
"尽管由父母来包办是不明智的，然而做子女的在这类事情上还是应该 征求一下父母的意见；严格说来，父母也许至少应该有否定的权利。侄子 事先没问问你的意见就结了婚，我承认他是错误的。不过，哥哥，说老实 话，是不是你多少也促成了他这种错误？关于婚姻问题，你屡次表示的主 张难道没使侄子确信你准不会同意一门没有什么陪嫁的亲事吗？你现在所 以生气，难道不正是仅仅由于女方没有陪嫁？如果侄子方面没尽到做子女 的责任，难道你这方面不是也太滥用了做父亲的权柄，事先不让他知道就 为他订下一个老婆，而这个女人连你自己也没见过！如果你真的见过她， 并且晓得她的底细，那么你会认为只有自己发了疯才会想到把她娶到你家 里来。
"尽管这么说，我仍承认我侄子这件事做错了，然而这不是一个不可饶 恕的过失。他确实办了一件事先应征得你的同意而没征得的事，然而这件 事主要是关系到他个人的利害。你自己必须承认（你也一定会承认）你考 虑的只是侄子的好处。如果不幸侄子的意见和你相左，他对幸福有错误的 看法，哥哥，如果你真爱儿子的话，难道你忍心把他逼得更加深入歧途 吗？他选择得鲁莽了些，难道你愿意再加重这件事情的不良后果吗？本来 他也许不至于遭殃的，难道你非要他遭殃不可？哥哥，一句话，由于不肯 按照你替他规定的办法来发迹，难道你就要尽量叫他受苦？"
圣•安东尼也根据真正的天主教信仰感动了鱼类，俄耳甫斯丝和安斐荣［电 就更进一步，他们凭音乐的魅力迷住了纯粹无生命的东西。这都是不可思 议的！然而不论在历史还是神话中，都还没人敢于记载一个凭辩论和说理 能战胜贪婪这个劣根性的事例。
老耐廷盖尔先生不想回答他弟弟的话，他只不过泛泛地指出，在子女 教育问题上，他们弟兄二人一向就各持不同的见解。"兄弟，"他说，"当初 你要是光管你自己的女儿，没来替我的儿子操心就好了。我相信，不论你 对他的训诲还是你为他树立的榜样，对那个孩子都没什么益处。"原来小耐 廷盖尔是他这位叔父的教子，他跟叔父比跟他父亲住在一起的时候要长， 所以这位叔叔常说他爱侄子几乎跟自己的孩子一个样。
这位好心的先生的态度，使琼斯欢喜非常。可是当他发现老耐廷盖尔 先生不但没消气，反而越劝越恼火，就赶紧领着这位做叔父的到密勒太太 家来会他的侄子。
第九章
各种奇妙的事情
琼斯回到寓所一看，情况跟他离开的时候大不相同了。密勒太太、她 的两个女儿和小耐廷盖尔先生正在一道吃晚饭哪。这位叔父愿意不拘礼节 地参加进来一一在座的他都认识，因为他曾到这里看过他侄子几次。
老先生立刻走到南锡小姐跟前，问候她，并且向她道喜；他向密勒太 太和她的次女也一一道了喜。最后，他又以同样和蔼客气的语调，恰如其 分地向他的侄子祝贺，就仿佛他侄子是跟一位同他一般阔，甚至比他还阔 的小姐结了婚，而且好像一切手续仪式都事先办妥了。
这样一来，南锡小姐和那位假定已娶了她的丈夫倒脸色苍白，开始发 呆。密勒太太则尽快抽出身来，她叫人把琼斯请到客厅，马上向他下跪， 声泪俱下地喊他作善心的天使，称他是她这贫苦小家庭的活命恩人，以及 其他种种崇敬而又亲热的称号。凡是最大的恩赐能从最知感恩的胸膛里引 得出来的话，她都说了。
她这阵激情（她说自己实在憋不住了，非把一腔感激涕零之情倾泻出 来不可）稍稍平息下去之后，就告诉琼斯说，她女儿和耐廷盖尔先生的婚 事已经谈妥了，他们次晨就举行婚礼。琼斯先生听了表示很高兴，那位可 怜的妇人又狂喜一番，连连向他道谢。他好不容易才劝住她，陪她一道回 到大家跟前，看到所有的人都还像刚才那样高兴。
主客欢度了两三个小时。那位做叔父的见了酒就没命。他一再劝侄子 也喝。耐廷盖尔先生虽没醉倒，也已经晕头转向了。他把老先生领到楼上 他以前住的房间里，然后讲了下面这片真心话：
"您既然是最好心、最疼爱我的叔父，而且您又以无比的仁厚宽恕了我 这桩确乎有点考虑欠周的婚事，那么倘若我再对您有所隐瞒，那就是大逆 不道了。"然后，他就坦率地把事实真相向他和盘托出。
"怎么，杰克，"老先生说，"这么说来，你还没跟这个年轻妇女结婚 吗真的还没有，"耐廷盖尔回答说，"我告诉您的全是老实话。""好小 子，"做叔父的边嚷边吻着他，"我听了太高兴啦。我一辈子从来没这么快 活过。要是你已经跟她结了婚，我一定尽我的力量帮助你减少一件坏事带 来的后果。不过一件做了而且无可挽回的事和一件想做而还没做的事，可 大大不同。杰克，你冷静地考虑一下，你就会看出这门亲事有多么荒唐，
愚蠢。用不着我劝阻你就会放弃的。皿请问叔父，”小耐廷盖尔回答 说，"难道一件已经做了的事和一件道义上非做不可的事，就有这么大区别 吗瞎扯，"做叔父的说，"道义这东西完全是人造出来的。既然如此， 人就可以任意摆布它，控制它，它得听咱们的指挥。你也晓得赖婚这种事 是算不得什么的。最严重的也只不过使社会上感到些吃惊，议论一天也就 烟消云散了。难道什么人会因此就不再希望把自己的姐妹或女儿嫁给你 吗？那些姐妹、女儿难道就会因此而不肯理睬你吗？在这类事情上，谁也 不会去问合不合道义。""亲爱的叔父，"耐廷盖尔大声说，"对不起，我永 远也不会这么想。我不但不能抛弃道义，也不能抛弃良心和仁爱之道。我 完全相信要是我此刻对这个年轻姑娘负了心，她就一定活不下去了。我应 当把自己看作杀害她的凶手，而且是用最残忍的手段把她杀害的，那就 是：使她肠断心碎。""肠断心碎！"做叔父的嚷道，"杰克，不会的，不会 的。女人的心可结实啦，小伙子，没那么容易碎。""可是叔父，"耐廷盖尔 回答说，"我已经爱上她了，同旁的任何女人结合，我永远也不会幸福的。 我听您讲过多少遍：子女应当婚姻自主，说您将来也一定让我堂妹哈丽特 那样办。""嗯，不错，"老先生说，"我会那样做的。但我是要子女挑选得 当呀。真的，杰克，你非抛弃这个姑娘不可，一定得照办。""叔父，”做侄 子的大声说，"我非娶她不可，一定得娶她。""你非娶她不可！"做叔父的 说，"小先生，我决没料到你会对我这么说话。要是你对你父亲这么说，我 倒并不奇怪；他一向把你当作条狗对待，就像暴君对子民那么拒你于千里 之外。可是我一直以平等的身份跟你相处，你跟我讲话总该不同一些吧。 我晓得这是由于什么：这完全是因为你受的那荒谬的教育；关于这事你可 怪不到我的头上。瞧，我自己的闺女，我也是用平等的态度把她扶养大 的，可是她无论做什么，总先问问我的主意；对我出的主意，她从来也没 不采纳过。""您可还没在这类事情上给她出过主意哪，"耐廷盖尔说，"倘 若连您断然下的命令我的堂妹也肯俯首屈从，并放弃自己的意愿，那我就 算大大看错了她啦。""别诬蔑我闺女，"老先生有些激动地说，"别诬蔑我 的哈丽特。我教育她以我的志趣为志趣。我让她随心所欲，其实我已经养 成她只乐于做我所喜欢的事情。""对不起，叔父，"耐廷盖尔说，"我十分 敬重堂妹，丝毫没有责难她的意思。我相信您永远也不会给她这种难题来 做，或者像您逼我这么去逼她。可是，亲爱的叔父，咱们还是回到客厅去 吧。要是咱们离席太久了，大家就会感到不安。不过，我向亲爱的叔父求
一个情：别说什么足以使那可怜的姑娘和她母亲震惊的话。""啊，这一点 你用不着担心，"老先生回答说，"我晓得自己决不会在妇女面前失礼。因 此，你要求的这一点我一定办到；同时，我也指望你答应我一个要 求。""叔父，"耐廷盖尔说，"您的吩咐我总是很乐于听从的。""我不求你 旁的，"这位叔父说，"只求你陪我回寓所一趟，我要把这件事跟你谈得更 仔细一些。尽管你父亲是这样固执悖谬，把自己看作世上的头号聪明人， 可是我仍然竭力保全咱们的门第。”
耐廷盖尔深知他叔父和他父亲一般固执，就答应陪他回去。这样，叔 侄两个又回到客厅，老先生答应仍像刚才一样地有礼数。
第十章
短短一章，结束本卷
叔侄二人走开了这么半天，引起座上每个人的不安；尤其当他们进行 上述那段谈话时，那位叔父曾不止一次提高了嗓门，楼下都可以听到。尽 管听不清他们究竟说些什么，但是在南锡、她的母亲一一甚至琼斯听来， 都有不祥的预感。
因此，当主客又重新聚在一道的时候，大家脸上都起了显著的变化。 方才席间是一片春风，人人都喜气洋洋的，此刻就没那么畅快了，正像从 晴天到阴天，从六月到十二月那种通常出现的天气变化一样。
可是在座的人们并没怎么理会这种变化，大家此刻都想不动声色，仍 然装作欢欢喜喜的样子。他们都忙着扮演自己的角色，当然顾不得去做看 客。这样，叔侄二人都没从这家母女的脸上看出什么异样的神情，而母女 也没从那做叔父的过分殷勤以及那个青年人硬装出的满脸堆笑、似乎怡然 自得的样子中，看到什么。
这种情况我相信往往会发生的：当两个朋友各自全神贯注地努力装出 一副样子来欺瞒对方的时候，双方都察觉不到旁人对自己所玩的花招。这 样双方都刺了过来（此处用击剑来比喻未尝不恰当）。
同样，在交易场上，双方都以为使对方吃了亏的事也是屡见不鲜的， 其中，自然有一方总是吃亏更大些；就如一个卖掉瞎马的人，收到的却是 假钞票。
半小时光景，主客就分手了。那位叔父把他的侄子带走一一走以前， 耐廷盖尔先生低声向南锡小姐保证，第二天一早他一定回来履行他的全部 诺言。
在这整个事件中，直接利害牵涉得最少的是琼斯，他看得最清楚。事 情真给他猜中了。他不但看出那位叔父的举止神态大有改变，开始保持距 离，对南锡小姐的客气也十分勉强做作；同时，这么深更半夜把个新郎从 新娘子身边带走也是罕见的事。这只能用一种想法来解释：估计小耐廷盖 尔已经把全部真相向他叔父吐露了，以他那种爽直性子，又加上喝了个半 醉，这是十分可能的。
正当琼斯在那里考虑着该不该把自己这些猜测透露给那可怜的母女 时，寓所的女仆告诉他说，有位女客要见他。他立刻奔了出去，从女仆手
里接过蜡烛，把来客让到楼上。这位客人(正是昂诺尔大姐)给他带来关 于苏菲亚的一个极其可怕的消息。琼斯立刻顾不到去想旁人的事了。他的 怜悯心一下子全都倾注在他自己和他所爱的苏菲亚的遭遇上去。

第十五卷
历史乂前进两天光景
第一章
此章短得无需标题
有一班宗教（或者说得更确切些，伦理）作家教导我们说，世上的善 行必然引向幸福，罪恶必然导致不幸。这个学说颇有教益，而且也大快人 心。可惜我们只在一点上不能同意：它并不符合事实。
说实在的，倘若这班作家所说的"善"指的是贤慧的主妇们必须遵守的 闺范，诸如不要串门子，莫管旁人的家务事等等，我当然立即可以表示赞 同，因为所有这些善行准可以把我们引入福境；我恨不得违背古今圣哲的 主张，与其把这些称之为善行，倒不如称之为明智。对现世的看法，我认 为再没有比古代伊壁鸠鲁［1］学派的体系更明智的了，他们认为这种明智就构 成了主要的美德；同时，也再没有比反对这个学派的现代伊壁鸠鲁学派更 愚蠢的了，他们把全部幸福都寄托于使各个感官欲望充分得到满足。
倘若善行指的是（我也几乎认为它应该是）某种相对的品德，它总是 在外面四处奔走，对旁人的福利像对自己的福利一样热衷的话，那样要我 同意这必然会引向人生幸福就没那么容易了。因为在这种情况下，我觉得 我们势必要把贫穷、轻蔑以及诽谤、嫉妒和忘恩负义为人类所能带来的一 切损害都包括在幸福的概念里；有时候我们甚至不得不为追求上述幸福而 身陷囹圄，因为这种善行已经把许多人带到那里去了。
现在我没有空闲进入似乎在我眼前开展着的如此庞大的思考领域，我 只想扫除一个妨碍我的论点。因为正当琼斯先生为了保全同类免遭毁灭而 不惜奔波、扮演最道德的角色的时候，魔鬼或者旁的什么妖精（说不定还 披着人皮）却在不遗余力地毁着他的苏菲亚，以便使他整个地陷入悲惨境 地。
倘若善行必然引向幸福确实是个规律的话，这似乎是个例外。然而我 们在生命的历程中看到此类的例外太多了，我们决定来驳斥这套规律所依 据的那个学说。我们不认为它是符合基督教义的，也不相信它是真实可靠 的。而且这个学说足以破坏一个极为崇高的论点：只有理性能提供对永生 的信念。
不过读者的好奇心（如果他有任何好奇心的话）现在一定激发起来， 如饥似渴，我们就尽快来满足大家。
第二章
-个陷害苏菲亚的毒计开始发动
我记得一位具有真知灼见的老先生说过："当孩子们什么都没干的时 候，他们正是在淘气啦。"我当然不想把这个颇为别致的说法引申到所有的 女人身上去，不过可以这样说：当女人没有由于争风吃醋而公然闹得天翻 地覆的时候，估计她们那股歹毒的情感必然在暗地里作祟。明里不好干 的，就暗中捣鬼。
贝拉斯顿夫人的行径就恰好是个例证。在她那一脸的笑容下面，隐藏 着对苏菲亚的深仇大恨，她已经清楚地看到正是这位年轻小姐妨碍着她， 使她的欲望不能尽情满足，所以她下决心要设法扫除这一障碍。过不久果 然就有了个十分便当的机会。
读者大约还记得，当一帮以"京城人"自居的年轻人在戏院里用他们的 机智和诙谐把苏菲亚吓得惊慌失措的时候，作者曾提到她请求一位年轻贵 族的庇护，那位贵族就妥帖地把她送上轿子。
这位贵族时常来拜访贝拉斯顿夫人。苏菲亚来到京城以后，他不止一 次在那里见过她，对她发生了很大的好感。一个美人从没有比她遇难时更 惹人怜爱的了。苏菲亚那次的惊惧使那位贵族对她更加有好感，如今甚至 说他已经爱上了苏菲亚也不算夸大其词。
不难设想，贵族决不会放过进一步亲近自己所爱的人儿这个大好机 会。况且仅仅就礼貌来说，他也理应去拜望她一趟。
于是，出事的第二天早晨他就来拜望苏菲亚了。照例先向她问候一 番，希望头天晚上那么慌忙逃出戏院，她没蒙受什么损害。
爱情正像火一样，一经扇动起来，就会冒起熊熊烈焰。没多久，苏菲 亚就把他彻底征服了。时间在不知不觉中飞逝，贵族和这位小姐谈了两个 钟头，他才忽然觉得停留太久了。虽然单单这个情况就足以使苏菲亚惊恐 （因为当前她是能够计算时间的），而从亲眼观察中，她也多方面看出对 方的心怀。尽管他并没公开诉说爱情，可是他的许多言谈举止都过于亲 热、温柔；即便在向女人献殷勤的风气很流行的时代，也不能认为这只不 过是出于殷勤，何况大家全晓得当今这个时代的风气恰好相反。
贵族来拜望时，刚一进宅贝拉斯顿夫人就得知了。贵族呆了那么长 久，她十分满意，认为事情正像她所希望的那么进展着。第二次看到这对
年轻人在一起时，她也是这么估计的。她认为（我看也很有道理）当这对 男女相聚的时候，她切不可插进来。因此，她关照仆人：贵族临走的时 候，告诉他说，夫人想会会他。乘这当儿，她想出一条贵族一定非常乐于 照办的计策。
费拉玛勋爵（这正是那位年轻贵族的称号）刚一被引见，夫人就用这 种口吻向他进攻："天哪，爵爷，您还没走哪！我还以为我的用人没听懂我 的吩咐，让您走掉了呢。我有桩要紧的事要跟您谈。""啊，贝拉斯顿夫 人，"他说，"您对我呆了这么久感到吃惊，这是难怪的。我已经坐了两个 多钟头，自己却以为连半个钟头还不到呢。""爵爷，从您这话中我能得出 什么结论来呢？"她说，"一定是谈得很愉快，所以时光不知不觉地就溜走 了。""老实说，再愉快没有啦，"他说，"请问，贝拉斯顿夫人，您忽然给 咱们社交界带来这么一颗灿烂明星，她究竟是谁呀爵爷，什么灿烂明 星？ ”她装作吃惊地说。"我指的是那天我在这儿会到的那位小姐，”他 说，"昨晚在戏院里她还倒在我的怀里，如今我又作了这次冒昧的访 问。""啊，您是说我的外甥女魏斯顿呀！"她说，"爵爷，那颗灿烂明星是 一位呆头呆脑的乡绅的闺女。她这是初次来到京城，才来了两个星期光 景。""哎呀，"他说，"我敢起誓她一定是在宫廷里长大的。她不但长得漂 亮，我生平还没看到比她更文雅、更有见识、更懂礼数的了。""啊，”夫人 嚷道，"我看我那外甥女准是把您征服啦。""说良心话，"他回答说，"我但 愿如此，因为我爱她爱得几乎发了疯。皿爵爷，”她说，"这对您也并不 坏，因为她的家当大得很哩。我可以明确地告诉您：她是个独养女，她父 亲每年的进益足有三千镑。""那么，夫人，"勋爵说，"我也可以肯定地告 诉您：我认为这是全英国最好的一门亲事。皿当然，爵爷，”她回答 说，"倘若您欢喜她，我衷心希望您将得到她。""夫人，既然您对我如此好 心，”他说，"而您又是她的亲戚，您可不可以劳驾替我向她父亲提提亲 呢？皿您真的有意吗？ ”夫人装出+分庄重的样子嚷道。"夫人，”他 说，"希望您总不至于以为我会拿这种大事来跟您开玩笑吧。皿既是这 样，"夫人说，"那我自然乐于在她父亲面前替您提亲。您放心，我看他准 会高高兴兴地答应的。不过，这里有个难关，我简直不好意思讲出来，这 —关您是根本没办法突破的。您有个情敌。其实，提起这个情敌的名字我 都不好意思，然而这个人，不管是您还是其他所有的人，谁也战胜不 了。""哎呀，贝拉斯顿夫人，"他嚷了起来，"您这可是在我心上泼了一盆
凉水，几乎叫我活不成了。""爵爷，不然，"她说，"我倒希望在您的干柴 上加了一把烈火。既然爱上她了，还谈什么泼不泼凉水！我倒料想您必然 会问起这位情敌的名字，好立刻向他挑战，去决斗哩。皿我答应您，夫 人，"他回答说，"为了您这位标致的外甥女，什么事我都肯去干。不过， 请问这位幸运儿是谁？""啊，他吗？"她说，"说来叫人难过！像世上绝大 多数幸运儿一样，他是个最卑贱的人：一个乞丐，一个私生子，一个弃儿 ――出身比大人的跟班还要低微。""然而那可能吗？”他大声说，"这么十 全+美的一个少女竟会委身于如此下贱的人？皿唉，爵爷，”她回答 说，"您别忘了她是在乡下长大的，而对所有的姑娘来说，乡间的毒害可大 啦。她们在那儿学到一套浪漫的恋爱观，还有旁的许多怪念头，就算是进 了城，在这么好的社交圈子里整整过上一冬，也没法把那套东西根除 掉。""夫人，"勋爵说，"您的表亲太宝贵了，决不能让她这么毁掉自己， —定得挽救她。""唉，爵爷，"她嚷道，"怎么挽救呢？家庭方面能做的全 都做了，可是我看这姑娘已经着了迷，她不把自己毁掉决不罢休。跟您明 白说吧，我时刻都担心她会跟那家伙逃跑哩。""贝拉斯顿夫人，"勋爵大人 说，"您的话令我深深感动。我听了只会更同情您的表亲，决不会减少我对 她的爱慕。这么一件无价之宝，咱们一定得想个办法把她保全下来。夫 人，您劝导过她吗？"听到这话，夫人假笑了一声，大声说："亲爱的爵 爷，您对我们女人家总不至于这么不了解，竟然会说什么劝导一位少女放 弃她所爱的人！这些无价之宝就像她们随身佩戴的那些宝石一样听不进人 们的话。时间，大人，只有让时间这剂药来医治这种愚蠢。可是我看她一 定不肯服这一剂药。我时时刻刻都为她提心吊胆着哪。一句话，对她非采 取强硬手段不可。""那怎么办好呢？"勋爵嚷道，"采用什么手段呢？还有 什么法子可想吗？啊，贝拉斯顿夫人！为了得到她，我什么都肯干。""我 也真不晓得该怎么好啦，"夫人沉吟了一下说。然后，她又沉吟了一阵，嚷 道："我敢发誓，对这个姑娘我真是一筹莫展啦。要是想挽救她，就得马上 动手；而且，就像我所说的，一定得拿出点强硬手段。说句公道话，除了 这点痴情，她各方面都很值得人爱一一我想她很快就会明白过来自己有多 么愚蠢。要是爵爷确实爱上了我这个外甥女的话，我看也许有个办法。这 个办法实在很讨厌，我几乎不敢去想它。我告诉你，这需要很大的勇气 哩。""夫人，"他说，"我觉得在这方面自己还不缺乏，我希望别人也不要 对这一点有所怀疑。如果在这样场合我还畏畏缩缩，那可真是头号的胆小
鬼了。""不，爵爷，"她回答说，"我对您一点儿也不怀疑，我对自己的勇 气要没有把握多了。因为我必得冒一场很可怕的风险。一句话，我必得对 您的人格寄予最大的信任一一多于一个明智的女人在任何情况下所肯寄予 的。”在这一点上勋爵也给了她+足的保证，因为他的名誉一向很好，大家 对他的夸奖也是理所当然的。"那么，"她说，"爵爷……啊，这个办法我实 在想都不敢想。不，不能这样做……最起码也得先把其他办法都试过后再 采用这个。您能不能摆脱旁的约会，今天就在舍下便饭？这样您就有机会 多见见魏斯顿小姐。我告诉您，时间可耽误不得。没有旁人，只有贝蒂夫 人和依格尔小姐，还有汉姆斯提上校和汤姆-爱德华。他们都不会呆很久 的，此外，我谁也不接见。那时候，爵爷就可以看得更明白一些。我要想 法让您相信她确实爱着那人。"勋爵大人彬彬有礼地接受了她的邀请，然后 就分手去换衣服。此刻已经过了早晨三点，用旧法来计算，就是午后三点 了。
第三章
对上述计策作进一步的说明
读者谅必早就断定贝拉斯顿夫人是那个大世界的一员（而且并不是渺 小的一员），其实，她还是那个小世界的一个举足轻重的人物。小世界指 的是近来在我国十分昌盛的一个崇高而可敬的团体。
这个团体是根据若干良好的条例创建的，其中，有一条特别值得注 意：它规定所有成员在二十四小时之内必须至少说一个有趣的谎言，并把 它在男女成员中间散布，正像上次战争结束后，由参战的英雄们组成的那 个尊贵的俱乐部规定会员每天必须至少打一次架一样。
关于这个团体，流行着许多无聊的传闻。从传闻的某些特点来看，如 果认为是那个团体自己散布的，也不算冤枉。比如说，会长是魔鬼，他坐 在桌子上首的一把圈椅上。后来经过认真的调查，我发现没有丝毫的事实 根据。其实，这个团体的成员都是一些正派人，他们所散布的谎言也无伤 大雅。目的不过是为了让大家开心和逗乐。
爱德华也是这个滑稽团体的一员。所以贝拉斯顿夫人就把他当作实现 她的计划的一个适当的工具。她向爱德华提供了一个谎言，要他等夫人一 提个头儿，就散布出去。不过要等到晚上，除了费拉玛勋爵和他本人之 外，其他朋友都已离去之后，也就是说，在他们玩纸牌的时候才说出口。
读者来到的这个场景就正发生在当晚七八点钟左右。贝拉斯顿夫人、 费拉玛勋爵、魏斯顿小姐和汤姆正在玩纸牌，玩到最后一局了。这时，贝 拉斯顿夫人对汤姆提个头儿说："汤姆，近来你可越来越不像话啦。你一向 总告诉我们一些京城的新闻，如今，世上的事情你什么也不晓得，简直像 是个世外人了。”
随后，爱德华先生就这么说开了 ："夫人，这可怪不得我啊。这只能怪 咱们这个时代平淡无奇，没什么可谈的……哦！我倒想起来啦：威尔科克 斯上校遭遇了一件非常可怕的事……可怜的涅德！爵爷，您认得他。人人 都晓得他。唉，我非常替他担心。”
"到底是什么事呀？"贝拉斯顿夫人问道。
"也不过是他今天早晨在一场决斗里杀了人。”
勋爵大人不晓得其中秘密，就郑重地问杀的是什么人。爱德华回答 说："是一个咱们都不认得的年轻人。刚从萨默塞特郡到京城来的一个小伙
子，名叫琼斯。他是奥尔华绥先生的一个近亲一一爵爷一定听说过奥尔华 绥先生吧。我看见那小伙子的死尸躺在一家咖啡店里。我敢说，那是我生 平看到的最漂亮的尸首！”
汤姆提到有个人被杀的时候，苏菲亚正在分牌。这时，她住了手，仔 细听着（因为这类事情一向是使她难受的），可是当故事讲到后一半的时 候，她又分起牌来：她给这家三张，那家七张，另一家十张，最后，她丢 开其余的牌，就晕倒在椅子上了。
正如通常遇到这种情形时一样，在座的人们先是一阵骚乱，然后进行 急救，最后，苏菲亚也照例缓醒过来。然后，在她本人的恳求下，马上就 被扶回她自己的房间去了。这时，在勋爵的请求下，贝拉斯顿夫人就对苏 菲亚说了实话，竭力把这事说成是她随便开的一个玩笑，并且一再安慰苏 菲亚说，那些话是她唆使汤姆讲的，而汤姆和勋爵都不晓得事情的底细。
不需要旁的证明，就足以使费拉玛勋爵相信贝拉斯顿夫人告诉他的事 是确凿无疑的了。所以她一回到客厅，两位男女贵族就共同订下一条计 策。尽管在勋爵眼里这计策并不算毒辣（因为他忠实地答应事后一定尽力 用婚姻来弥补，并且也确实准备履行这一诺言），可是我们相信许多读者 定然会表示痛恨，这也是理所当然的。
他们预定第二天晚上七点钟实现这个可怕的目的。贝拉斯顿夫人担 保，到时候让苏菲亚一个人在场，再引导勋爵去见她。为了这个目的，她 对全家都作了布置。仆人大都派出宅去了，为了不让昂诺尔大姐起疑心， 就让她留在女主人身边，直等勋爵临来的时候才把她叫到另一个房间去， 使她离下毒手的地方尽量远些，好听不到苏菲亚的呼救声。
事情商妥之后，勋爵就告辞而去，夫人也回房去安歇。她对这一计策 十分满意，并且相信必然会成功。那样一来，她相信苏菲亚就再也不能妨 碍她去和琼斯勾搭了。而且这条计策妙在即便事情传出去，她也不会担什 么罪名。不过，她肯定会让他们赶快结了婚，这样外面也就不会追究了。 她觉得苏菲亚被凌辱之后，是不难说服的。她家族中的其他成员也一定会 感到欣慰。
但是在夫人那位同谋者的心里，事情并不是这么平静。他的心七上八 下，怔忡不安，正像莎士比亚所作的绝妙的描写：
拟订可怖的计划， 直至开始行动， 恰似幻象或噩梦; 精神与肉体的器官， 相互商量，整个身心, 宛如小小王国， 即将发生内讧。⑵
尽管勋爵由于对苏菲亚热切追求，刚一听到这条计策，尤其又是出自 这位小姐的亲戚之口，立刻就欣然采纳了；可是当他躺到枕头上细一寻 思，就看到了这件事的邪恶本质，以及种种必然和可能发生的后果，他的 决心就开始动摇，或者不如说，转到相反的方向去了。是珍惜荣誉呢，还 是满足情欲？经过整整一宵的内心矛盾，荣誉感终于占了上风。他决定去 拜望贝拉斯顿夫人，并且放弃这一计策。
虽然时间已经不早了，贝拉斯顿夫人还没起床。正当苏菲亚坐在她床 畔的时候，仆人进来禀告说，费拉玛勋爵在楼下客厅里哪。她吩咐请他稍 等一下，她马上就去会见。可是仆人刚一走开，可怜的苏菲亚就恳求夫人 不要鼓励那个讨厌的勋爵（尽管这个叫法不大公道，然而她确是这么说 的）为她的缘故总来拜望。"我看出他是别有用心的，"她说，"昨天早晨他 毫不掩饰地对我表示过爱情。我是决计不允许他这样做的，因此，我求夫 人再也不要叫我们单独在一起，并且请您吩咐仆人，每当他要见我的时 候，就请替我回绝了吧。”
"哎唷，孩子，”贝拉斯顿夫人说，"你们这些乡下姑娘满脑子都是情 人。男人只要对你们客气一些，你们马上就以为人家是向你们求爱。他是 京城里最懂得对妇女献殷勤的年轻人，我相信他对你只不过表示一些殷勤 就是了。跟你谈恋爱！说得倒好。我巴不得他会跟你谈。如果你拒绝，那 你才是地地道道的疯女人呢。”
"可我就是要当个疯女人，"苏菲亚大声说，"我希望您不要逼我非接见 他不可。”
"啊，孩子！"贝拉斯顿夫人说，"你不用那么害怕。要是你已经下定决 心跟那个琼斯跑掉，谁也拦不住你。”
"真的，夫人，"苏菲亚大声说，"您这是侮辱我。我永远也不会同任何 男人跑掉，而且我也决不会跟一个我父亲不同意的人结婚。”
"那么，魏斯顿小姐，"夫人说，"要是今天早晨你没心情会客，就请你 回到自己的房间去吧。我是不怕勋爵的。我要把他请到我的化妆室来。”
苏菲亚谢过夫人，就走开了。随后，费拉玛就被请上楼来。
第四章
可以看出当女人运用自己的口才来干坏事的时候，她是多么危险的 -个辩护士
当贝拉斯顿夫人听到年轻的费拉玛勋爵那些顾忌时，她所抱的轻蔑态 度，正像司法界的圣人一一新门律师回对待一个良心不安的年轻证人那 样。"亲爱的爵爷，"她说，"您需要一盅强心酒吧。我一定得派人到埃吉里 夫人那里讨一些上好的强心酒来。得啦，要果断一些。难道您怕'强奸'这个 字眼儿吗？或者是担心……？哼，倘若海伦四的故事发生在今天的话，我会 觉得不大合情理。我指的是巴里斯的表现，而不是海伦对他的情意；因为 所有的女人都倾心于有胆量的男子。还有一个关于撒宾［5］族的妇女的掌故 ――好在那也是远古的事了。爵爷也许佩服我博览群书吧。不过，记得胡 克［6］先生说过，这些女人事后都变成很贤慧的妻子了。我估量在我认识的一 些已婚的妇女当中，有些就曾经给她们的丈夫强奸过。""喏，亲爱的贝拉 斯顿夫人，”他嚷道，"请您别这么嘲弄我吧。皿我的好勋爵，”她回答 说，"您以为英国有哪个女人（不管她脸上装得多么正经）心里头不笑您 吗？……是您逼得我使用一种奇怪的语言，而且刻薄地泄露了我们女人的 本质。但有一点我是可以自慰的：我居心是好的，一切都是为了成全我这 个外甥女，因为尽管发生了这样的事，我想您还是会娶她的；不然的话， 我才不会劝她为着一个空头爵号就把自己给交出去的。我不能让她日后怪 我使她失掉一个有胆量的男人；因为那个小伙子的仇人也不能不承认他确 实是有胆量的。”
凡是曾从妻子或情妇的口中听到过这种话的男人请说说看，是不是由 于这类话是出自女人之口，就变得更娓娓动听了呢？可以肯定，这番话此 刻要比德摩斯梯尼［刀或西塞罗的演说更深入了勋爵的心坎。
贝拉斯顿夫人看出她已经煽动起这位年轻贵族的自豪感了，这时，正 像一个真正的雄辩家，就开始来激发他旁的情感。"爵爷，"她用更加庄重 的口吻说，"请您回忆一下，这件事还是您先向我提的；我决不愿让您觉得 好像是我硬要把我的表亲塞给您。一个有八万镑家当的姑娘是不需要人来 举荐的。""魏斯顿小姐也不需要靠财产来举荐，"他说，"因为在我看来， 没有哪个女人有她一半那么漂亮。""爵爷，有的，有的，"夫人望着镜子回 答说，"我敢保证，有些女人还不止有她一半那么漂亮呢，不过，我也不必
在这方面来贬低她。毫无疑问，她确实是个玲珑可爱的姑娘，而再过几个 钟头她就要落到一个实在配不上她的男人怀抱里去了；不过说句公道话， 那人倒真是有胆量的。”
"夫人，"勋爵回答说，"但愿如此，虽然我必须承认那人是配不上她； 除非上天和夫人都叫我失望，否则不到那个时候她就要落到我的怀抱里 了。”
"爵爷，这话说得好，"夫人回答说，"我可以向您保证，我决不会叫您 失望的。我相信不出一个星期，我一定就可以当着众人喊您作外甥女婿 了。”
其余的谈话不外乎一些表示欣喜、抱歉以及恭维的话，交谈的双方听 来十分入耳，在这里重复起来却颇为索然无味。因此，我们就此结束他们 二人的谈话，赶快来叙述一切准备就绪、企图一举毁掉可怜的苏菲亚的那 个不幸的时刻。
这既然是全书最令人悲伤的情景，我们将为它专辟一章。
第五章
部分内容会使读者感动，另一部分会使读者惊讶
时钟已敲了七下，可怜的苏菲亚正独自苦闷着，坐在那里读着一部悲 剧，剧名《不幸的婚姻》电］。她刚读到穷愁潦倒的伊莎贝拉要卖掉她的结婚 戒指那部分。
这时，书从她手里跌到地上，两行热泪洒了下来。她就这样愣了一阵 子，随后，门开了，费拉玛勋爵走了进来。看到他，苏菲亚立刻从椅子上 一惊而起。勋爵向前走了几步，朝她深深打了一躬，说道："魏斯顿小姐， 我这么闯进来太冒昧了。""爵爷，"她说，"没料到您会来，我得承认我确 实有点吃惊。""小姐，"费拉玛勋爵说，"您要是没料到我会来，那么我上 次荣幸地见到您的时候，我的眼睛一定是没能忠实地表达我的心意。您既 然占据了我的心，您总料到我本人会来的吧。"尽管苏菲亚此刻慌得不知所 措，可还是用无比鄙夷的神情（我认为十分应该）来回答这句大言不惭的 话。勋爵接着又说了一大套类似的话。苏菲亚听了浑身发抖地说："难道我 真得认为爵爷发了疯吗？爵爷，除非这样，否则实在没法来解释您这种行 为。""小姐，”勋爵大声说，"我确实像您想的那样，而且我发疯还是小姐 自己引起的，对这种后果您总该原谅吧。爱情已经完全夺去我的理智，我 简直没法对我的任何行动负责了。""爵爷，”苏菲亚说，"老实告诉您，我 既不懂您的话，也不理解您的行为。""小姐，”他叫道，"那么请准许我跪 在您的脚下向您解释，让我把心剖给您看，告诉您说，我爱您已经爱到神 魂颠倒的地步了。啊，最可爱、最神圣的人儿！用什么言词足以表达我的 衷肠呢！""告诉你，爵爷，"苏菲亚说，"我决不打算再呆在这里听您这种 话。皿千万别这么忍心离开我，”他嚷道，"您要是能体会到我一半的痛 苦，您那副柔软心肠就会怜悯我对您的情意一一那正是您那双眼睛所勾起 的。”说完，就长叹了一口气，握住苏菲亚的手，喃喃地说了一阵子什么 ――小姐听了感到不快，要是重述出来读者也不会有好感的。最后，他向 苏菲亚表白说，倘若他拥有整个世界的话，他也愿奉献在她脚下。苏菲亚 用力把手夺开，十分激动地说："我可以告诉您，先生，我要用同样的鄙夷 来唾弃您那个世界和它的主人。”说完，她就朝门口走去。费拉玛勋爵又来 抓她的手，说："原谅我吧，可爱的人儿。只有绝望的心情才使我这么放肆 起来……请相信我，只要有一线希望得到您，我以最谦卑的方式把我的爵
位和财产全献给您一一两者本来都不算小，只是跟您一比，才显得渺不足 道，请您收下吧……反正我不能失去您。对天发誓，我宁愿死也不能失掉 您。您是我的，必须是我的，非是我的不可。""爵爷，"她说，"我凭人格 向您保证，我永远也不要听您这种话。求您不要作这种徒然的追求。爵 爷，撒开我的手。我决计立刻走开，今后也决不再会见您了。""小姐，”勋 爵嚷道，"那样的话，我就得尽情利用这一时刻，因为没您我活不成，我也 不愿意没有您而活着。皿爵爷，您这是什么意思？ ”苏菲亚说，"我要喊 啦。""小姐，”他回答说，"除了失掉您，我什么也不怕。我决计不让自己 失掉您，所以只好采取绝望中看到的唯一办法。"说着，他就上前把苏菲亚 搂在怀中。苏菲亚大声喊叫，倘若不是贝拉斯顿夫人事先把人都调开，准 会有人前来搭救她的。
不过这时可怜的苏菲亚总算运气：另外一个声音现在嚷起来了，几乎 把她的喊叫声淹没，因为它响彻整幢房子。"这丫头在哪儿呢？该死的，我 非立刻把她赶出窠来不可。嗨，把她的房间指给我！我的女儿在哪儿呢？ 我晓得她就在这幢房子里。只要她还活着，我就非见到她不可。指给我， 她在哪儿！"随着最后一句话，门就打开了。魏斯顿乡绅走了进来，同他一 道来的牧师和一批赳赳武夫也跟在后面。
可怜苏菲亚的处境够多么狼狈啊，连听到她父亲的咆哮声都悦耳极 了。这声音确实很受欢迎，他来得真巧。只有这样巧的一件事才能使她心 灵上的宁静免于永远受到破坏。
不管苏菲亚多么惊骇，还是马上听出她父亲的声音来。不管勋爵多么 癫狂，也听出理智的声音在斩钉截铁地告诉他说，这决不是干那种坏事的 时刻。勋爵听到声音越嚷越近，同时也听出那是谁的声音（由于乡绅不止 —次喊着"女儿”，苏菲亚也就一边挣扎，一边喊着："爹！"），他认为应 该放开手中的猎物，虽然他仅仅揪乱了她的围巾，并且用粗暴的嘴唇蹂躏 了她那白嫩的脖颈。
倘若读者不用自己的想象力同我合作的话，我是永远无法描绘出魏斯 顿走进房来时苏菲亚和勋爵的情景的。苏菲亚蹒跚走到一把椅子跟前，倒 了下来。她浑身凌乱，面色苍白，气喘吁吁地怒视着费拉玛勋爵。对她父 亲的到来，心里高兴多于害怕。
勋爵在离她不远的地方坐了下来。假发袋⑵耷拉到肩头上，上衣扯开 了，里面的衬衣露出一大块。他又惊又怕，又恼又羞。
至于魏斯顿乡绅，此刻他恰巧被一个敌人俘虏了。这个敌人时常袭击 我国大多数乡绅，而且几乎总是马到成功。明白说吧，他喝醉了。由于这 种情况，加以他生性暴躁，势必促使他立刻扑到他女儿跟前，破口大骂。 倘若不是牧师拦住，他很可能还会动起武来呢。牧师劝道："先生，看在上 帝的面上，别忘记您是在一位贵妇人的家里。求您先消消气。令媛总算找 到了，您就应该十分满意才是。咱们可不作兴报复的。我在小姐的脸上看 出深深的悔恨来了。我可以担保，要是您饶恕了她，她一定会痛改前非， 以后一定好好听您的话。”
最初，牧师胳膊的力量比他的唇舌更管用。不过，他后边那段话也起 了些作用。乡绅回答说："要是她答应嫁给他，我就饶她。苏菲，只要你肯 嫁他，我什么都饶你。呃，你咋不说话？你非嫁他不可！妈的，非嫁他不 可！你咋不做声呀？天底下哪儿找你这么个顽固蛋去！”
"先生，请您放和缓一些，"牧师说，"您把小姐吓得话都说不出来 了。”
"怎么？”乡绅说，"那么，你站在她那边儿吗？你可倒是个好牧师，替 个忤逆丫头帮起腔来啦！哼，我还会来维持你那饭碗吗？我宁可给魔鬼 去！”
"请先生多多原谅，"牧师说，"请您相信，我决没有这个意思。”
这时，贝拉斯顿夫人进来了。她走到乡绅跟前。乡绅一见到她，立刻 就决定遵照她妹妹的指点，带着乡巴佬的神情毕恭毕敬地向她深打一躬， 说了几句恭维的话。随后，他就发起牢骚来了。他说："表妹，你看，这是 世间最不听父言的女儿。她死死地迷上了个流氓叫花子，怎么也不肯嫁给 我替她选的女婿一一全英国再也找不出更称意的亲事了。”
"魏斯顿表兄，"夫人回答说，"我想您一定冤枉我的外甥女啦。她明明 晓得这桩亲事对她多么有利，我相信她不会拒绝的。”
贝拉斯顿夫人很清楚魏斯顿先生心目中指的是谁，这是她故意假装糊 涂一一她想也许不难使乡绅接受勋爵的求亲。
"你听见夫人的话了吗？”乡绅说，"所有的亲戚都赞成这门亲事。喏， 苏菲，做个乖丫头吧。孝顺孝顺，叫爹高兴吧。”
"爹，如果我的死亡可以叫您高兴的话，"苏菲亚回答说，"那您很快就 可以高兴了。”
"你这是说鬼话，苏菲！这是他妈的鬼话，你心里明白的，"乡绅说。
"确实是这样，魏斯顿小姐，"贝拉斯顿夫人说，"你冤枉了你父亲。在 这门亲事上，他一心一意只是为你好。我和所有的戚友一样，也只能认为 这门亲事是对你们家族莫大的光彩。”
"对，我们全这么认为，"乡绅说，"而且这门亲事并不是我提的。她自 己也晓得还是她姑姑先向我建议的一一喏，苏菲，我再求你一次：做个乖 孩子，当着姨的面答应下来吧。”
"外甥女，"夫人说，"那么就让我把你的手交给他吧。如今已经不时兴 花许多时间在谈情说爱上头啦。”
"时间算得啥，"乡绅说，"以后不有的是时间去谈情说爱吗？两个在一 道睡过觉之后，还可以好好去谈情说爱呢。”
费拉玛勋爵完全相信贝拉斯顿夫人指的就是他。既然他从来没听说过 布利非，就也不会想到那方面去，所以他断定魏斯顿指的也是他。于是， 他就走到乡绅跟前说："先生，虽然我早先无缘拜识尊颜，不过，既然我求 的婚事已经蒙您接受，那么就请准许我斗胆替小姐求求情，请您此刻不必 再催促她了。”
"你来求情？"乡绅说，"喝，你又他妈是谁？"
"先生，我是费拉玛勋爵，"他回答说，"我就是希望能蒙您认作女婿的 那个幸运儿。”
"尽管你穿了那身绣金边的衣服，"乡绅回答说，"你也还是个婊子养 的。要你当我的女婿？滚你妈的蛋！ ”
"先生，我对您理应比对旁人更容忍些，”勋爵说，"不过我必须告诉 您：这种话我是没有听惯的，所以不能不动气。”
"动气……"乡绅说，"你以为腰里有把小攮子荡来荡去，我就怕你这种 人吗？放下你那把攮子，我一定好好给你点教训，叫你再也不来管闲事。 给你点苦头吃，你就不再乱叫我老丈人了，我要剥你的皮。”
"那很好，先生，"勋爵说，"当着妇女们我决不想惹纠纷。事情已经很 明白了。那么，再见，先生；再见，贝拉斯顿夫人。”
勋爵刚走，贝拉斯顿夫人就走到魏斯顿先生跟前说："哎呀，您可惹乱 子啦。您晓得冒犯谁了吗？他是位高官厚禄的贵族，昨天刚刚向您的女儿 求过婚，我本来想您一定会十分高兴答应下这门亲事的。”
"表妹，"乡绅说，"您爱干啥随你便，我是决不跟这些贵族打交道的。 我女儿要嫁的是个正正经经的乡下绅士。我已经替她物色好一位了，她非
嫁那人不可。我打心窝子里向您道歉，这丫头给您添麻烦了。"贝拉斯顿夫 人针对"麻烦”这个字说了些客气话，乡绅随后说："多谢您一番好心……需 要的时候我也一定会为您同样效劳。咱们亲戚本该你帮我、我帮你的。那 么，就再会了吧一一走吧，小姐，你得乖乖跟我走，不然的话，我就喊人 把你抬上马车。”
苏菲亚请他不用动武，表示愿意跟他走。不过她央求让她坐轿子去， 旁的不能坐。
"请问，"乡绅嚷道，"你说说看，马车为啥坐不得？嗬，真没听说过！ 不成，不成，在你没出嫁以前，我一直紧紧盯着你。这一点你放心好 啦。"苏菲亚说，她看出父亲是拿定主意要使她心碎。"哦，"他说，"要是 给你找个好丈夫就会使你心碎的话，那么你就心碎并且见鬼去吧。不听话 的丫头在我眼里半个铜板也不值。"说完他就使勤抓住苏菲亚的手。这时， 牧师又来拦阻了，劝他用温和的办法。乡绅听了破口咒骂了一声，吩咐牧 师住嘴，并说："你现在是在讲坛上吗？上了讲坛，你爱讲啥就讲啥，我不 管。可是我不能让教士管住，也不能一举一动听你的指挥……夫人，再见 吧……来，苏菲，做个乖孩子吧，一切都会如意的。嫁给他，妈的，嫁给 他！ ”
昂诺尔大姐在楼下出现了。她朝乡绅深深地行了个礼，要跟着伺候她 的女主人。可是乡绅把她推到一旁说："别来，别来，再也不许你靠近我家 屋内。""您要赶掉我的女仆吗？”苏菲亚说。"对，我就是要赶掉她，"乡绅 嚷道，"你不必愁没有女仆。我给你换一个更好的。我敢用五镑跟你赌一克 朗，这种家伙与其说是个女仆，倒像是我的奶奶呢。不成，不成，苏菲， 你放心，我决不能让她再来搞一场私逃的把戏了。"说完他先把苏菲亚和牧 师全塞进一辆出租马车，然后自己才上了车，吩咐赶到他的寓所。路上， 他没再跟苏菲亚说话，只对牧师讲了一通社交礼貌的大道理，教他在有身 份的人们面前举止应当如何如何。
倘若贝拉斯顿夫人有意留下苏菲亚的话，乡绅也许没那么容易就把自 己的女儿带走了。实际上，她对苏菲亚将被软禁起来这件事颇感到高兴。 既然她和费拉玛勋爵定下的计策失败了，她对用另一套横暴办法强逼苏菲 亚嫁给另外一个男人这件事，也很满意。

第六章
乡绅是怎么找到他女儿的
尽管在许多小说里，有比魏斯顿这番出现更加难以理解的情节，读者 只好自去琢磨；然而我们，只要力所能及，却十分愿意为读者解释一下。 现在我们就来说明乡绅是用什么办法探得他女儿的下落的。
在本书第十三卷第三章里，我们曾从侧面暗示过（因为我们照例只透 露当时所必须透露的情节）费兹帕特利太太很急于和她的叔父魏斯顿以及 姑母和解，而她认为倘若出些力，保全苏菲亚，不让她再犯她自己曾犯过 的激怒家人的那种罪过，说不定她就可以得到和解。经过几番考虑，她决 计把堂妹的下落告知魏斯顿姑妈。于是，她就写了下面这封信。为了种种 原因，我们将它逐字逐句抄录下来，以飨读者：
姑母大人：
我握笔想禀告的这件事也许会使您对此函抱有好感。此函是为您的一个侄女而写的，自 然我不能指望它对您的另一侄女会有什么好处。
不多烦渎您了。正当我要动身来向您请罪的时候，真是再巧没有，我遇到了堂妹苏菲。 关于她的一切经过，您自然比我更要清楚。不过，唉，我所晓得的已经太多了 ；足以使我相 信：倘若不立即阻止，她也将重蹈我的覆辙一一我就是由于愚蠢无知，拒绝了您那最明智又最 慎重的劝告，不幸落到目前这般田地的。
总之，我见到那个男人了。昨天我大半天都和他在一起。他确实可以说是个翩翩少年。 至于我是怎么与他邂逅的，这里就不啰嗦了。可是为了回避他，今晨我迁居了。我深恐他从我 这里探得堂妹的下落。他至今仍不知堂妹何在，而且在叔父对她作了妥善安置之前，也最好不 让他知道；因此，望千万抓紧时机。我只需禀告您：堂妹此刻寄居在贝拉斯顿夫人处。我曾见 到夫人，并发现她有意将堂妹隐藏起来，不让她家里的人知道。姑母谅必知道，她为人很古 怪。但如果除禀明事实概况之外，我还在您这样见多识广的人面前说三道四，那就很不得体 了。
姑母，您一向总热心维护家中每人的荣誉及真正的利益。我希望通过当前我在此事上所 表现的对家庭利益的关怀，能重新获得您的恩宠，恢复您往日对我的情谊。我过去的幸福即大 多仰赖您这种情谊所赐，对我今后的幸福也是不可缺少的。
尊贵的姑母，我是您最孝顺、最感恩的侄女，最顺从、最谦卑的仆人，
哈丽特•费兹帕特利谨禀
信送到时，魏斯顿女士正住在她哥哥家里一一自从苏菲亚逃走后她一 直住在他家，好在可怜的乡绅悲痛时安慰他。这种安慰她每天都必定给他 一些，前边我们已经举了个例子。
正当魏斯顿女士背朝着壁炉，手里捏着一撮鼻烟，对她哥哥进行当日 的那份安慰，而乡绅在吸着下午他那袋烟的时候，上述那封信寄到了。她 读完就递给乡绅说："阁下那只迷途羔羊的消息来了。你的命运总算不坏， 失而复得；要是你听从我的主意，你还可以把她保全下来呢。”
乡绅一读完信，立刻就从椅子上一跃而起，把烟斗丢到炉火里，快活 得狂叫了一声"呼啦"。接着就喊仆人们来，吩咐给他拿靴子，备上"骑士”和 旁的几匹马，要人立刻把撒波尔牧师请来。办完这些事之后，他就朝他妹 妹掉过身来，搂住她，紧紧地拥抱了一下说："见鬼！你好像并不高兴。人 家会以为你看到我找到了女儿反倒难过呢。”
"哥哥，"她回答说，"最深刻的政治家总要尽力探讨事态的根源，他的 看法往往和浮在表面上的大不相同。当然，目前的情势还没有当年路易+ 四世兵临阿姆斯特丹城下时也的荷兰那么绝望，但是处理这类事情要细腻才 行。恕我说句不客气的话，我担心这方面你是缺乏的。哥哥，对待像贝拉 斯顿夫人那样有名气的女人，你得讲究一定的礼数，依我看，这就需要对 比你所接触的要高贵的社会有所了解。”
"妹妹，"乡绅大声说，"我晓得你是看不起我的才识的。这回咱们倒看 看谁是傻瓜。了解！说得好。我在乡下住了这么些年，对于本国的拘票和 法律总了解一些吧。我晓得不管在哪里找到了我自己的东西，我都可以取 回来。告诉我我女儿在哪里，我要是不能把她搞到手，你就喊我一辈子傻 瓜。伦敦像旁处一样，也是有保安官的。”
"哎呀，听你这么一说我就发抖了，"她嚷道，"要是你听我的劝告，这 件事才能有美满的结果。哥哥，难道你真以为一位名门贵妇的府第可以凭 拘票和粗暴的保安官就闯得进去吗？听我告诉你怎么进行。一到京城，你 先置上一套像样的衣服（真的，哥哥，你现下没一件穿得出去的），然后 派人去给贝拉斯顿夫人请安，表示要去拜望她。当她接见你的时候（她一 定会接见的），你就把来意向她说明。要适当地提一下我的名字，因为尽 管你们也是亲戚，可是我想你们仅仅会过一面。我相信她一定会撤回对侄 女的庇护的，因为她本来也是不得已才收下她的。这是唯一的办法。哼，
用得着保安官吗？你以为在一个文明国家里，保安官能奈何得了一位名门 贵妇吗？"
"去他妈的名门贵妇，"乡绅嚷道，"好一个文明国家，女人就不受法律 管啦！一个臭婊子把人家的女儿扣下来不交给她的生身之父，我凭啥还去 给她请安问好？告诉你，妹妹，我并不像你设想的那么无知。……我晓得 你想让女人家不受法律管，可那都是瞎扯。我听到巡回法庭上的法官说 过，没有人是法律管不了的。不过，这也许是你们汉诺威的法律吧。”
"魏斯顿先生，"她说，"我看你越来越无知了。……我说你是头地地道 道的狗熊。”
"魏斯顿妹妹，"乡绅嚷道，"我要是头狗熊，那么你就是头熊狗。妈 的，你口口声声讲着礼数长礼数短，可是你从来也没让我看到你有啥礼 数。我不是熊，也不是狗，可我晓得有人就是条母……M妈的，我要叫你看 看我比有些人懂得礼数。”
“魏斯顿先生，”那位女士说，“随便你说什么，je vous mesprise de tout mon C8ur[#,所以我也不去生气。同时，我那个改姓讨厌的爱尔兰 姓的侄女说得很对，我对维护家庭的荣誉和真正的利益是热心的；苏菲亚 是家庭的一员，我当然也是关怀的。我决定亲自为这件事去一趟京城。真 的，真的，哥哥，派你到文雅的宫廷里去当使节是不适当的。格陵兰…… 格陵兰才是野蛮人办交涉的场所。”
"天哪，我又听不懂你讲的什么啦，"乡绅嚷道，"你又说起你们那汉诺 威官话来了。不过，我要叫你看看在礼数方面我并不比你差。既然你没因 为我的话生气，那么我也不生你的气了。真的，我一向认为亲戚跟亲戚吵 嘴是愚蠢的。要是谁偶尔失言，喏，大家应该相互包涵一些。至于我，我 是从来不记仇的。你说要去趟伦敦，我很领情。我一辈子才去过两趟，每 回呆不上两个星期。那么短时间，我也不可能对街道很熟悉，也结识不上 很多人。我从来不否认在这类事情上你比我懂。我要是在这上头跟你争 辩，那就同你跟我争辩怎样管理猎犬，怎样找到伏窝的野兔一样白 搭。""我向你保证，"她说，"我永远也不会。""好，"他回答说，"我也向 你保证，永远不和你争辩另一个问题。”
于是，交战的双方（借用那位女士的话）就缔结了盟约。这时，牧师 来到了，马也备好。乡绅答应一定照他妹妹的话去做，然后就动身了。魏 斯顿女士准备次日上路。
路上，乡绅把他妹妹的意见对牧师说了。他们二人都认为那套礼数大 可以省略掉。乡绅改变了原来的想法之后，就照前一章所叙述的样子进行 了。
第七章
可怜的琼斯遭到种种不幸
昂诺尔大姐就是在这般情景下来到密勒太太家里的。她把琼斯从席间 喊了出来。当她看到周围没有旁人，就这样讲起来了 ：
"啊，亲爱的先生，我怎么有勇气告诉您呢？您完啦！我那可怜的小姐 完啦！我也完啦！皿苏菲亚怎么了 ？ ”琼斯像个疯子似的瞪大了眼嚷 道。"糟到家啦，"昂诺尔大声说，"哎，我再也找不到这么好的一位小姐伺 候了。哎，怎么叫我有这么一天呀！"听到这话，琼斯面如死灰，浑身颤 抖，急得张口结舌。可是昂诺尔接着说了下去："哎，琼斯先生，我永远失 去了我的小姐啦。""怎么了？发生了什么事？天哪，快告诉我。啊，我亲 爱的苏菲亚！""您叫得对，"昂诺尔说，"她也是我最亲爱的小姐。我再也 找不到这样的差事啦。""管你那该死的差事！"琼斯大声嚷道，"我的苏菲 亚在哪儿？她……她怎么啦？皿当然，当用人的都是该死的，”她大声 说，"给赶出大门，完了，不论遭遇到什么反正都无所谓。当然，她们不像 旁人一样是血和肉做成的。当然，她们不论遭到什么，反正都无所 谓。""要是你还懂得点怜悯和同情，"琼斯嚷道，"我求你立刻告诉我苏菲 亚怎么啦说真的，我对您比您对我要怜悯，"昂诺尔回答说，"我决不 因为您失掉了世上最可爱的一位情人就说您该死。说真的，您是值得怜悯 的，我也是值得怜悯的，因为，说真的，这样好的女主人是找不到的 了……""究竟发生了什么事？”琼斯嚷道，他几乎快急疯了。"什么事？什 么事？"昂诺尔说，"不论对您还是对我，都不能再坏了。她父亲进了京 城，把她带走，撇下了咱们俩。"听到这里，琼斯跪了下来，说谢天谢地， 总算没发生更坏的事。"没发生更坏的事！"昂诺尔重复道，"对咱们俩来 说，还能有什么比这更坏的事！他把小姐带走，满口赌咒说非把她嫁给布 利非先生不可。这是给您的好消息。至于可怜的我呢，他把我赶出了大 内。""昂诺尔大姐，"琼斯说，"你刚才真把我吓呆了。我还以为我的苏菲 亚遭到什么最可怕的横祸，相形之下，甚至看到她嫁给布利非都算不了什 么啦。亲爱的昂诺尔，只要她的性命在，就有希望。在这片自由的国土 上，对女人是不能用暴力逼婚的。""说真的，先生，"她说，"这话也对。 您是还有些希望的。咳，但是可怜我有什么希望？当然，先生也明白，我 受这罪全是为了您。乡绅唯一讨厌我的，就是因为我站在您这边，反对布
利非先生。""确实是这样，昂诺尔大姐，"琼斯说，"我明白自己欠你的情 分。我一定会尽力弥补你。皿唉，先生，”她说，"一个当用人的丢了差 事，除非再给她找个同样好的差事，还有什么旁的办法弥补昂诺尔大 姐，”琼斯说，"不要绝望。我希望能让你再干原来的差事。皿咳，先 生，"她说，"既然晓得这是不可能的了，我为什么还抱这种奢望？乡绅已 经把我恨透啦。除非有一天您娶了小姐一一说真的，我是满心希望您会娶 她的，因为您是一位慷慨、好脾气的绅士。我相信您爱她。说真的，她也 像爱自己的生命那样深深爱着您。这是否认不了的，因为凡是稍微认识我 们小姐的都看得出来。可怜的亲爱的小姐，她也不会瞒人。要是一对相爱 的人不能过得幸福，那么谁能呢？幸福并不总靠你有多大家当，况且我们 小姐的家当也足够两个人享用的了。说真的，正像人们所说，硬拆散这对 鸳鸯真太可惜了。就我来说，我相信你们两位终归一定会团圆的。因为要 是应该团圆，那谁也阻挡不住的。如果上天注定了要你们成为夫妻，那地 上所有的保安官也不能把你们拆散。说真的，我但愿撒波尔牧师拿得出点 勇气来，告诉乡绅这么逆着女儿的心愿来逼婚是造孽。可是他完全靠乡绅 过活。因此，尽管这位可怜的先生是个虔诚信教的好人，背着乡绅也讲这 么做多么不对，可是当着乡绅的面他却不敢讲真心话。说真的，我还不曾 见过他像这回这么大胆过。我真担心乡绅会揍他呢。先生，您不要难过， 也不要绝望。事情也许会有转机的。您只要相信我们小姐，我认为您完全 可以相信，她决不会同意嫁给旁人的。真的，我很怕乡绅脾气一上来会伤 害她，因为他的性子真躁，可怜的小姐心肠又软得像只雏鸡，我怕她会心 碎的。真可惜，我认为小姐就是缺少我这份勇气。要是我爱上了个小伙 子，我爹把我锁了起来，我会扑过去把他的眼珠子抠出来。不过，眼下还 有一大笔财产的问题。给不给她，大权在她父亲手里。说真的，这就不同 了。”
究竟是由于琼斯在仔细倾听上边那番话呢，还是由于他找不到一个插 嘴的空隙，我不能断言；反正琼斯一句也没搭腔，而昂诺尔也始终没停 嘴。她一直说到巴特里奇奔进屋来，告诉琼斯说，那位贵夫人已经上楼 了。
琼斯此刻陷入的窘境真是无法比拟。昂诺尔根本不晓得他和贝拉斯顿 夫人是相识的，而琼斯又最怕让昂诺尔晓得这段关系。一时情急之下，他 手忙脚乱，采取了（这也是人之常情）最糟糕的办法：不是把昂诺尔暴露
给夫人（那本来不会出什么乱子），他却把夫人暴露给昂诺尔了。所以他 决定把昂诺尔藏起来。仓促间，他勉强把昂诺尔塞到床后头，拉上床幔。
琼斯为可怜的房东太太和她的一家奔走了一整天，接着昂诺尔大姐带 来这个可怕的消息，如今贝拉斯顿夫人又突然到来，忙得他头昏脑涨，使 他把以前的一些想法忘得一干二净。这样，他丝毫也没想起该装病的事 ――他不但服装华丽，而且容光焕发，也难以使人相信他是有病的。
他尽量显得满面春风，不论是真的还是装的，一点病容也没露出。这 种接待固然激起了夫人的情欲，却是她事先没有料到的。
贝拉斯顿夫人进了房，一屁股坐在床上。"喏，我亲爱的琼斯，”她 说，"你总该晓得不管什么事也不能阻止我长久不来看你。也许我应该生你 的气，因为一整天我都没见到你，也没得到你的音信。我看得出你的病并 没叫你出不得门。我想，你也未必像个分娩后的少奶奶那样穿得整整齐齐 的，成天坐在屋里接待客人吧。不过，别以为我打算骂你。我永远也不会 使出一个做妻子的坏脾气来给你造成借口，对我摆出一副做丈夫的冷淡样 儿。”
"不，贝拉斯顿夫人，"琼斯说，"既然我一心在这里听候吩咐，我相信 您总不会责怪我没尽到责任。亲爱的人儿，咱们俩究竟谁更有理由抱怨 呢？是谁，昨天晚上爽了约，害得一个不幸的人空等着，渴望着，叹息 着，懊丧着？"
"亲爱的琼斯先生，"她大声说道，"别再提啦。要是您晓得我为什么没 能来，您会同情我的。一句话，您想不到一个有身份的女人为了应付世上 这滑稽场面，得忍受一些蠢货们怎样的无礼。好在懊丧和渴望并没损害您 什么，因为我从没见您的神情曾像此刻这么俊美过。琼斯，我敢赌咒，画 家们大可以拿您当作阿都尼也的原型绘下来呢。”
有些挑衅性的话，在讲求荣誉的男人听来，是只能用拳头来回答的。 在情人之间，有些话也许只能报之以一吻。当前贝拉斯顿夫人对琼斯说的 这番恭维话就属于这一类，尤其她说的时候神情之温柔，超过了她的唇舌 所能表现的。
毫无疑问，琼斯此刻已陷入无比尴尬而痛苦的境地，因为（还用前边 那个比喻来讲吧）夫人向他挑战了，然而由于屋里还有第三者，琼斯不便 去应战，甚至连话都答不出；这种性质的决斗照规矩是不能有副手在场 的。贝拉斯顿夫人则以为除她自己而外，并没有旁的女人在场，所以就没
感到这重障碍。她静候了一会儿，对琼斯怎么还不给她回答这一点大为纳 闷。琼斯意识到自己多么可笑，他远远站在那里，既然不敢做出应做的答 复，就索性不吭声了。再没有比这一幕更可笑的，倘若持续下去的话，就 再也没有比这更可悲的了。夫人脸上已经变了两三回颜色。她从床边站起 来，又坐下。琼斯则恨不得脚下的地陷了下去，或者头上的屋顶塌了下 来。这种狼狈情景本是凭西塞罗的辩才或马基雅弗利的权术都无能为力 的，只有看着他丢尽颜面。这时，一件意想不到的事却把琼斯救出困境。
这不是别的，正是小耐廷盖尔来了。他喝得酩酊大醉，或者说，已经 醉到理性失去了功能，但四肢却还没失去功能。
密勒太太和她的女儿们这时都已入睡，巴特里奇则正在厨房里围炉吸 着烟斗，所以耐廷盖尔一路没人阻拦，一直就闯到琼斯的房门口。他推开 了门，正要毫不客气地往里走，琼斯立刻奔过去把他挡住一一挡得正好， 耐廷盖尔要是再往前闯一步，就可以看出床上坐的是谁了。
其实，耐廷盖尔是误把琼斯的房间当作他自己的了。所以他才非要进 来不可，口里还连连咒骂着：凭什么不让他上自己的床。琼斯终于总算劝 住了他，把他交给了巴特里奇；他是听到楼上的吵嚷声赶来帮助主人的。
琼斯不得已，只好硬着头皮回到自己房间去。刚一进门，就听到贝拉 斯顿夫人在那里惊叫了一声（声音并不大），同时，看到她十分激动地往 椅子上一倒；要是一位体质娇嫩的，神经早就会失去常态了。
原来刚才夫人看到两个男人在那里搏斗，吓了一跳。听到耐廷盖尔口 口声声骂着，非要回到他自己的床铺上不可，夫人不晓得会发生什么事， 就想藏到她以前藏过的那个角落。可是令她大为狼狈的是，床幔后面那个 隐身之所已经被另外一个女人捷足先登了。
"琼斯先生，"夫人嚷道，"这叫人还能容忍得了吗？您这个卑鄙已极的 家伙……您叫我在什么穷骨头面前丢了丑？""穷骨头？"昂诺尔嚷道，一面 从她躲藏的角落里怒冲冲地跳了出来，"哦，穷骨头？说得倒好！……尽管 我是块穷骨头，可我是正正经经的。有些阔人却还不敢这么说。”
琼斯倘若是和女人勾搭的老手，本该立即去平息昂诺尔大姐的怒气， 然而他却诅咒起时运不济，悲叹自己是世上最不幸的男子。随即又掉转过 来，十分可笑地对贝拉斯顿夫人申辩自己的无辜。这时，夫人已经恢复了 沉着，像所有社交场上的妇女一样，这种沉着在她也是十分现成的，尤其 遇到当前这样的场合。她镇定地回答说："先生，您不必解释什么了。开头
我不晓得是谁，现在我认出原来是昂诺尔大姐呀。我决不怀疑您跟她会有 什么不清不楚的事儿。我相信她是个有见识的女人，也决不会对我的来访 发生什么误会。我一向对她都是友好的，今后我一定尽我的力量对她更加 友好。"
昂诺尔大姐正像刚才那么容易恼火一样，也很容易和解。因此，听到 贝拉斯顿夫人的口气软了下来，她的语气也缓和了。"夫人，"她说，"当然 我一向都是领夫人的情分的。说真的，从来没有人像夫人那么待我好 过……如今，想到刚才我是在跟您那么胡说八道，我恨不得把自己的舌头 咬掉。我会误会您……说真的，一个当用人的决不能把一位高贵的夫人看 成那种样子。我的意思是说，我过去是个用人。唉，说真的，如今我已经 不是谁的用人啦，这就使我更加倒霉透顶。我失掉了世上最好的女主 人……"说到这里，昂诺尔觉得理应泪如雨下。"别哭，孩子，"好心的夫人 说，"咱们也许想得出办法来弥补一下。明天早晨来见我吧。"说完，她就 拾起落在地上的扇子，连看也不看琼斯一眼，就大摇大摆地走出房去。在 上流妇女的厚颜无耻中却含有一种庄严，这一点是身份比她们低贱的妇女 在类似的处境下想做也做不到的。
琼斯跟她下了楼，几次伸出手来想搀她，但是夫人断然拒绝了。尽管 琼斯站在那里鞠着躬，她却毫不理睬地径自上了轿。
回到楼上以后，琼斯和昂诺尔大姐长谈一番；昂诺尔心绪不宁，一边 谈，一边使自己镇定下来。她谈的是琼斯对苏菲亚不忠实，愤愤不平地大 肆渲染了一番。可是琼斯终于想出办法跟她和解了。不但如此，而且她还 答应决不把这件事泄露出去。她准备次晨就设法去找到苏菲亚，并且替他 刺探出乡绅以后所采取的行动。
这件不幸的事情就这么结束了，只有昂诺尔大姐一人心满意足，因为 把一宗秘密抓到手里往往是一件具有巨大价值的财产一一有些读者根据自 己的经验会承认这一点的。不但对于那些忠实地保守这一秘密的人有价 值，即使对那些暗地里逢人便道（以致除了为着保守这一早已公开的"秘 密"而付出代价者，大家都已知晓）的人，有时也是有价值的。
第八章
虽短却令人畅快
不管密勒太太欠下琼斯多少情分，第二天早晨她仍然不禁为头天晚上 他的房间里那场风暴微微责备了他几句。话说得十分柔和、友善，她表明 纯粹是为了琼斯先生本人着想，事实也确是如此。所以琼斯不但没生气， 还满口感激地接受了那位好心女人的劝告，对已经发生的事表示+分抱 歉；他尽量作了些解释，并且答应再也不会将类似的纠纷引进这座房子。
虽然他们刚见面的时候，密勒太太忍不住私下里提出短短的规劝，可 是那天早晨请他到楼下来却是为了一件愉快得多的事：要他在南锡小姐和 耐廷盖尔先生举行婚礼的时候作女方的主婚人。这时，耐廷盖尔先生已经 打扮停当，并且酒也醒过来了；他至少已清醒到在许多读者看来，一个如 此草率成亲的人起码应有的程度。
这里也许应说明一下这位年轻绅士是怎样从他叔父身边跑掉的，以及 他何以会像头天晚上我们看到的那种样子。
原来当那位叔父把侄子带到寓所以后，一半为了自己过瘾（他是嗜酒 如命的），一半为了使得侄子无法立即实现和密勒小姐结婚的意图，就叫 人摆上了酒。他拼命劝这位年轻绅士喝。后者平素虽然不大喜欢饮酒，却 又还没讨厌到宁愿拂其好意，坚决不喝的程度。于是，过不久他就喝了个 酩酊大醉。
叔父取得了这一胜利，正动手替侄子安排床铺的当儿，有人送来一个 消息，使这位叔父大为震惊，仓皇失措，一时把侄子的事情忘个精光，全 部心思都被自己的忧患所占据了。
这个突如其来而令他痛心疾首的消息不是旁的，正是他刚一离开家 门，他的女儿就乘机跟附近一个年轻的牧师逃跑了。其实，她父亲对这位 牧师只能有一点挑剔：他一文不名。然而连对那样一个父亲，她都没觉得 应该把自己的恋爱透露给他。她进行得十分巧妙，直到事成之前，瞒得任 何人都从未起过疑心。
叔父一听到这消息，立刻就手忙脚乱。他要人马上雇好一辆驿车，把 侄子托给一个仆人照管，就匆匆走了一一几乎不知该干些什么，或是到哪 里去。
叔父就这么走掉了。仆人为了服侍这位侄子入寝，将他唤醒，好容易 才让他明白他的叔父已经走了。这位侄子并不接受对方的好意，却坚持叫 人雇一乘轿子。既然主人并没严厉命令不许这么做，仆人就立即照办了。 这样，小耐廷盖尔先生又回到密勒太太家里，脚步蹒跚地来到琼斯先生的 房门口，像前边已经叙述过的。
做叔父的这道障碍此刻已去掉了（尽管小耐廷盖尔还不晓得究竟是怎 么去掉的），参加婚礼的一干人全都迅速准备停当：密勒太太、琼斯先 生、耐廷盖尔先生和他的新娘子都上了出租马车，来到民法博士会馆也。在 这里，说句俗话，南锡小姐就成为一位明媒正娶的耐廷盖尔太太，而她那 可怜的母亲也就地地道道成为人间最快乐的女人了。
这时，琼斯先生看到他为这个可怜的女人和她这一家奔走已经有了圆 满的收场，就回过头来考虑自己的事了。为了避免许多读者会责备他这么 四处为旁人奔走太蠢，也免得有些读者会把琼斯想得比实际上还要无私， 这里我们认为理应明确告诉大家：他对这件事非但不是无动于衷，而且还 确实很关心，急于促成最后的圆满结果。
说来这似乎很矛盾，其实，琼斯这个人的确如特伦斯也所说的，Homo sum : humani nihil a me alienum puto [16]。他向来对任何人的痛苦或 幸福都不是个漠不关心的旁观者。当他促进了旁人的幸福时，就感到极大 的快乐；当他加重了旁人的痛苦时，也感到极端苦恼。既然由于他的奔 走，使这一家人从痛苦的深渊一直升到幸福的顶巅，他本人自然也无法不 感到莫大快乐一一这种快乐，也许比世人经历了最辛苦的劳动并且往往还 得干一些最卑鄙的勾当而取得的，还要大得多。
凡和我们这位主人公具有同样气质的读者，大概会认为本章虽短，却 包含着丰富的内容。另外一些读者又可能认为尽管本章篇幅不长，仍以删 去为妙，因为它无关全书的宏旨一一我料想这种人必是认为本书的目的就 是为了把琼斯先生送上断头台，或者让他遭到更加可悲的下场。
第九章
几种不同的情书
琼斯一回到寓所，看到桌上放着以下几封信。幸好他是按着收到先后 的次序拆阅的。
第一封
我确乎痴情到了不可思议的地步。不管我的决心多么大，又多么有道理，可是我一时一 刻也不能坚持。昨夜我决心永不再会你，今晨我又愿意听听你如何说法，看你能否如你所说把 这件事解释清楚。不过我晓得这是办不到的。凡是你能编造的理由，我统统想到了一一也许没 完全想到。也许你编造的本领要更大些。那么，接此信就立即来吧。只要你编造得出，我差不 多可以事先就答应你一定相信。又泄漏了一一不去想啦一一马上到我这里来一一这是此信的第 三稿了，头两稿已经焚毁一一我甚至想将此信也焚掉一一我多么希望自己不这么神魂颠倒啊 ――立即来吧。
第二封
如果你还指望得到我的宽恕，或想再进我的家门，那么就立即来吧。
第三封
原来前二函送到的时候，你不在寓所。那么接此信后就立即来吧一一我不外出，除你 外，我谁也不见。不会有什么事使你这么久不得脱身吧。
琼斯刚读完这三封短简，耐廷盖尔先生就走进房里来了。"哦，汤 姆，"他说，"昨晚那件事发生以后，贝拉斯顿夫人（这时，全寓所都晓得 那位夫人是谁了）有音讯来吗？""贝拉斯顿夫人？ ”琼斯很庄重地 说。"嘿，亲爱的汤姆，"耐廷盖尔大声说，"不要对朋友们这么保守秘密。 尽管昨晚上我醉眼蒙胧，看不清楚，可是我在化装舞会上看见过她的。你 以为我不晓得那位仙后是谁吗？""那么你真的认得化装舞会上的那位夫人 吗？”琼斯说。"可不，向你发誓，真认得，"耐廷盖尔说，"从那以后，我
对你暗示了足有二十回，可是在这件事上你总那么脸嫩，我也不好明说出 来。朋友，从你对这件事情所采取的缄默态度来看，我想你对这位夫人的 品格并不如对她的玉体那么熟悉。不要生气，汤姆，不过我凭人格发誓， 你决不是她所勾引的第一个年轻人。放心，你损害不了她的名声。”
尽管当初琼斯开头闹这档子风流事的时候就没理由去指望夫人是个贞 洁女人，然而他对京城的事情十分陌生，熟人也很少，对通常所谓的"假正 经"女人，就是那种徒有贞节的名声和外表，可是却和所中意的每个男子都 有勾搭的女人毫无认识。尽管十分稳重的妇女决不和这种人来往，可是整 个京城都和她交往。一句话，大家都晓得她是什么货色，然而彼此却心照 不宣。
琼斯发现耐廷盖尔已完全清楚他这档子风流事，也就觉得大可不必再 像以往那样讳莫如深了。他就任凭这位朋友讲下去，要求他把自己所晓得 的以及听到的一切有关夫人的事，坦率地说出来。
在许多方面耐廷盖尔都有些女人气，他很喜欢饶舌。所以，一旦听到 琼斯要他畅所欲言，他就大谈起那位夫人的事来；其中有许多情节非常有 损她的令誉，为了对上流妇女表示敬重，这里就不去重述了。我们一定要 十分谨慎，决不能使将来评论本书的人有机可乘，让他们肆意进行恶意曲 解，硬把我们弄成诽谤性的作家一一这是完全违背我们的初衷的。
琼斯聚精会神地听完耐廷盖尔的话，长叹了一声。耐廷盖尔听到后嚷 道："哎呀，希望你不是真的爱上她了吧！要是我晓得我讲的这些话会使你 难过，那我决不会让你听到的。""啊，亲爱的朋友，"琼斯嚷道，"我和这 个女人的关系陷得如此之深，我简直不晓得怎样自拔了。爱上了她？朋 友，没有；可是我欠了她的情一一很大的情。既然你了解得这么多，那么 我就什么也不瞒你啦。在这以前，也许完全由于她的接济，我才没饿肚 子。我怎么能够丢开这样一个女人？然而我又非丢掉她不可，否则我就对 一位远远比她更值得我敬爱的人背信弃义；亲爱的耐廷盖尔，我对那位小 姐的挚爱是很少人能体会到的。就是由于不晓得该怎么办，我才几乎快要 发疯了。皿那么请问，这是一位体面的小姐吗？ ”耐廷盖尔嚷道。"体 面！"琼斯回答说，"关于她的名声，还没人敢吐一个脏字儿。最芬芳的空 气也不比她的名声更纯洁，最清澈的溪水也不比她的名声更一尘不染。她 的身心都尽善尽美。她是宇宙间的绝色佳人，然而她又具有这么卓越、高 贵的品格。虽然她时刻萦绕着我的心怀，但只有见到她时我才想起她的美
貌来。""我的好朋友，"耐廷盖尔嚷道，"既然有这样好的一段姻缘，难道 你还舍不得丢开那个臭……""住嘴！"琼斯说，"不要再骂她什么。我最讨 厌对人忘恩负义。""瞎扯！"耐廷盖尔说，"你并不是头一个得到她这种好 处的人。她喜欢上谁，就大方得很。不过，让我告诉你，她这种恩赐事先 都考虑得很周密的，她在受惠者身上要激起的并不是感恩，而是虚荣 心。"一句话，耐廷盖尔在这个问题上发挥得那么淋漓尽致，讲了夫人那么 多情况，并且还发誓说件件都是实情，结果，琼斯心里对夫人的尊敬被他 这一席话一扫而光，感激之情从而也冲淡下来。老实说，他开始把受到的 那些好处不再看作是馈赠，而看作是薪俸了；这么一来，不但贬低了夫人 在他心目中的地位，而且也大大降低了自己的身价，这两件事都使他感到 十分不自在。从这种厌恶心情，琼斯的思路很自然就转到苏菲亚身上去 了。他一心思念的都是她的品德、纯洁、对他的情意，以及为他所遭受的 痛苦。于是他和贝拉斯顿夫人之间的这种关系就显得更加卑鄙可耻了。他 决定只要找到一个体面的借口，就辞掉她手下的这份差事（现在他对自己 和贝拉斯顿夫人的关系就是这么看法了），虽然这么做会使他丢掉饭碗， 然而他已经下定决心要离开她。琼斯把这个决心告诉了耐廷盖尔。这位朋 友思索了一下，对琼斯说："伙计，办法有啦。我想出一个万无一失的办 法：向她求婚，我保管你一定可以甩掉她。""求婚？”琼斯嚷道。"对，向 她求婚，"耐廷盖尔回答说，"她立刻就会跟你断绝关系了。我认识一个以 前靠她过活的男人，他曾经认真向她求过婚，结果白费力气，立刻被她一 脚踢开了。”
琼斯表示不敢去尝试这个办法。"说不定换个人向她求婚不那么使她震 惊呢？”他说，"万一她把我的话当真了，我将何以自处？我就作茧自缚， 永远完蛋啦。""不会的，"耐廷盖尔说，"我有一个随机应变的办法，保你 随时都可脱身。皿什么办法呢？ ”琼斯问道。"就是这样，”耐廷盖尔 说，"我刚才提到的那个小伙子是我的一个挚友。他们绝交之后，贝拉斯顿 夫人又做了一些损害他的事，他对那位夫人气愤极了。我敢肯定，用不着 费什么事他就会让你看看贝拉斯顿夫人写给他的一些信；如果她真肯嫁给 你的话，你就可以在婚姻没缔结之前，借此同她决裂；我不相信她肯跟你 结婚的。”
琼斯踌躇了一阵，就凭着耐廷盖尔提出的保证，同意了这个办法。可 是琼斯说他无论如何也没勇气当面去向她求婚，他就在耐廷盖尔的口授
下，写了下面这封信:
夫人：
您派人来召唤时，适我不幸因事外出，未能立即获知，甚为惆怅。今仍不能脱身趋前拜 访，当面道歉，尤觉遗憾。啊，贝拉斯顿夫人！前次在此间发生极不应有之事，每念及可能使 夫人令誉蒙受玷辱，辄觉毛骨悚然。今只有一途足以确保夫人声名之清白。我不必明说出来。 请夫人只允许我向您表示：我珍惜您的名誉一如我自己的，我生平唯一之奢望即能有幸将我的 自由奉献于您的脚下。请您相信，只有当我在法律上取得称您为“吾妻”的那一刻，我的幸福才 能真正美满。
夫人，您的最感恩、最顺从、最谦恭的仆人，向您致以最深切的敬意。
托马斯•琼斯
接到这封信后，她立刻写了这样一封回信：
先生：
当我读完您这封一本正经的大札后，从它的冷淡而郑重其事的语调，您似乎俨然已取得 了信中所提及的法律上的权利，宛如我们已经多年就形成了那种奇怪的动物一一夫妇。您真以 为我会那么傻？或者，您以为您可以使我神志完全昏迷，竟至听任我的全部财产落入您的掌 中，以便您用我的钱来寻欢作乐？难道这就是我所期待的爱情的证明吗？难道这就是您报 答......但是我不屑于指责您，并且十分钦佩您那片深切的敬意。
再者，信中措辞不及重新斟酌一下......上面也许有超出我的原意之处......今晚八点来 吧。
琼斯在他那位枢密顾问的咨议下，又复信说：
夫人：
来信对我表示的怀疑，使我不胜惊骇。贝拉斯顿夫人既疑心某有如此卑鄙之居心，难道 您还垂青于斯人？难道夫人对最神圣的爱情结合持如此轻蔑之态度？如果以往因爱夫人过于狂 热，无意中损及您的名声，难道您以为我仍将听任自己与您交往下去，以致此事不久即暴露于 世人面前，使您的体面受到无可挽救之创伤？倘若您对我持此看法，我只有切望有机会立即偿 清不幸从您手里接受的资助。至于您的情分，我当永志不忘......
他用和上一封信末尾完全一个样的话结束了这封信。 夫人是这样答复的：
我看出你是个痞子！我从心坎上唾弃你。如果你来，我决不接见。
虽然琼斯十分高兴能摆脱掉这道枷锁（凡是亲自尝过其滋味的都不能 不承认很不好受），可是他心里却还有些不自在。一个厌恶一切弄虚作假 的人，难免会感到那条计策过于狡诈了，他不会处之泰然的。倘若琼斯不 是处在极为困难的境况中，不开罪夫人就得对苏菲亚背信弃义的话，他是 决不肯照办的。我想读者也一定承认，无论爱情或其他种种节操，都竭力 替苏菲亚说话。
耐廷盖尔的计策收到奇效，受到朋友的一再感谢和赞扬，他自是快活 非常。他回答说："亲爱的汤姆，咱们彼此帮的忙大不相同。我帮你收回了 自由，你帮我丢掉了自由。但是如果你在收回了自由之后，能够像我失掉 了自由那么幸福，那咱们俩就是全英国最幸福的人了。”
这时，两位先生被请下楼去吃饭。密勒太太亲自下厨，使出她在烹调 上最好的本领来庆祝她女儿的婚事。她把这桩喜事主要归功于琼斯的热心 奔走。她心里充满了对他的一腔感激。她的每一个眼神，每句话，每个动 作都忙于表达这种感情，结果对女儿，甚至连新女婿都顾不得去招呼了。
饭刚用完，密勒太太收到一封信。不过，这一章里信已经够多的了， 就留到下一章来介绍吧。
第十章
一部分叙述事实，一部分发挥对那些事实的看法
上一章煞尾接到的那封信，是奥尔华绥先生写来的，信里说他立刻就 要偕外甥布利非到京城来，希望密勒太太照往常那样替他预备下榻的地 方：他自己住二楼，他的外甥住三楼。
可怜这个妇人脸上刚才现出的那副喜容这时又黯淡下去了。这个消息 确实使她很为难。一方面，耐廷盖尔先生毫不计较家当娶了她的女儿，如 今马上就把刚结婚的女婿赶出内外，实在说不过去；另一方面，既然受了 奥尔华绥先生那么大的恩惠，她又不能设想在任何借口下不让那位乡绅住 他完全有权居住的房间。原来奥尔华绥先生在不断周济旁人的时候，采取 的办法和大多数慈善家恰恰相反。他不但总设法不让世人知晓，甚至也不 让受惠者本人察觉。他一向用"借”或是"付给”的名义，不说是"赠与"。尽管 他在大量施舍，却总竭力用言语来冲淡他所做的好事。因此，当他拨给密 勒太太那笔五十镑年金的时候，曾说：考虑到他在京城时总要住她的二楼 （其实他并不怎么打算在京城逗留），才给她这笔钱；不过他来之前一个 月就通知她，旁的时候她尽可以出租。但是这一回他因急事突然到京城 来，没能早些发出通知。也许正因为他来得这么仓促，所以写这封预订住 所的信时忘记加上一句"倘若那时空着的话"一一因为即使密勒太太没有目 前这样充足的理由，他也会换个住处，不一定非来此地不可。
但是正如普赖厄由所精辟地指出的，有一种人的行动是：
超乎伦理学家所规定的 那些善与恶的准绳， 超出法律的条文。
对于这种人，被中央刑事法庭宣判无罪是远远不够的，甚至受到最严 厉的法官（良心）的开释，他们也不会感到满足。他们事事非做到公正而 合乎道义不可。倘若实际上做得还不够理想，他们就会痛心疾首，像一个 怕鬼或怕绞刑吏的杀人犯那么坐卧不安。
密勒太太正是这种人。她无法掩饰这封信所引起的焦虑。她刚把信里 的事告诉大家，并且透露出她面临的困难，她的好天使琼斯马上就请她放
心。"太太，"他说，"我随时都能替您腾出我那个房间。耐廷盖尔先生既然 还没来得及准备一所房子来迎接他的太太，我相信他一定肯回到他新租的 寓所去，耐廷盖尔太太也准会同意搬去的。"夫妻俩都接受了这个建议。
读者不难相信琼斯这番好心又使得密勒太太的双颊由于感激而红晕起 来。不过，如果说这位溺爱的母亲听到琼斯刚才称呼她女儿一声"耐廷盖尔 太太"（这是她初次听到这个悦耳的称呼）时，她对这件事比对琼斯解除了 她眼前的忧虑还要满意，从而越发感激他，读者也许就不那么相信了。
于是，就商定第二天为这对新婚夫妇以及琼斯先生乔迁的日子一一琼 斯先生也将安插到他朋友的这所房子里去。这样，大家又平静下来，欢欢 喜喜度过了这一天。只有琼斯是个例外。他表面上也和旁人一样欢笑，其 实，心里为了苏菲亚却痛苦万分。布利非先生将要到京城来的这个消息更 加剧了他的痛苦；他完全明白布利非此行的用意。昂诺尔大姐本答应去探 听苏菲亚的信息，黄昏时分来回报，可是这份指望也落了空，于是更使他 深为不安。
就他和苏菲亚此刻各自的处境来说，是不大可能盼到什么好消息的， 然而琼斯仍然急着要见到昂诺尔大姐，真好像她会带来一封苏菲亚约他相 会的信似的一一及至失望之后，使他觉得难挨。这种焦灼心情究竟是出于 人类总想晓得最坏的下场这个天生的弱点，因而使吉凶未卜的处境成为最 难以忍受的痛苦呢，还是由于他隐然还抱着某种希望，我们不便断言。凡 是曾经恋爱过的，必然晓得原因很可能是后一种。爱情在我们心灵中所起 的最奇妙的作用，莫如在绝望中总使人看到一线曙光。这种力量使人不把 事物的困难、没把握以至不可能的因素放在眼里。于是就可以用艾迪生关 于恺撒的那句话来形容任何一个痴情的人：
阿尔卑斯、比利牛斯诸山都在他面前坍塌下来。［盅
可是爱情有时候也会把鼹鼠窝变为高山，在希望中产生绝望之感。不过要 是体质好，这种寒潮为时是不会长久的。此刻琼斯究竟是处于哪一种心情 中，就任凭读者去揣度吧，我们自己也不确知，所以无可奉告。但是有一 点是肯定的：琼斯翘盼了两个钟头，他再也掩饰不住自己的焦虑不安，只
好回到房间里去安歇。正当他急得快要发疯的时候，昂诺尔大姐这封信来 了。现在将它verbatim et literatim1191呈现在读者面前：
先生：
要不是夫人不让我去，我本打算照我答应的来拜访您呢。先生，您当然知道每个人都得 先顾自己，这么好的差事我做梦也没想过的。我要是不领受夫人的好意（我没请求，夫人就留 下我来服侍她了），那我实在该挨骂。说真的，她是世上最好的夫人。谁不这么认为，心肠一 定坏了。说真的，要是我说过那种话，那是我不憧事，我很后悔。我知道您是又高尚又正派的 绅士，就是我说过夫人的坏话，您也不会再提，免得损害一个向来最尊敬您的可怜的女仆。说 真的，我以后说话一定得多加小心，因为谁也不能预知将来的事。要是昨天有人说我今天会得 到这个好差事，我决不会相信。说真的，我做梦也没想到会有这样的事，我也从来没存心抢过 旁人的差事。既然夫人没等我请求就自动赏了我这个差事，那么，说真的，不论艾托芙大姐或 者任何人也怪不得我接了这个送上门的差事。求您可别向人提起我说过的什么话。我祝您大大 走运。我相信您早晚会得到苏菲亚小姐。您自然了解，这方面我是不能再帮什么忙了，因为我 现在已经换了主子，得听人家的吩咐了。以前的话希望您千万别再提。
先生，我至死也将是您最恭顺的仆人，
昂诺尔•布莱克默
琼斯对贝拉斯顿夫人这一招有种种推测。实际上，夫人的用意只不过 是为了把知悉这件隐秘的那个人笼络在自己家里，免得事情传播得更广 ――她尤其希望不要传到苏菲亚耳里。尽管这位小姐几乎是最不会把这事 说出去的人，可是夫人仍旧不放心，因为她此刻已把可怜的苏菲亚恨透 了，她以为我们这位女主人公善良的心里也怀着对她的仇恨，虽然苏菲亚 的心从来也不曾容纳过仇恨的感情。
当琼斯正从昂诺尔被雇用这件事揣想贝拉斯顿夫人背后可能玩弄的上 千种阴谋诡计，因而感到胆战心寒的时候，命运女神（似乎一直不遗余力 地破坏他和苏菲亚这个姻缘的死敌）又想出一个新办法来拆散他们：她趁 琼斯处于绝境的时候来诱惑他一下，看来他是没法抵御的。
第十一章
一件离奇但并非空前的事
有一位亨特太太常在琼斯住宿的那家看到他。她跟那家的妇女很熟 悉，是密勒太太的挚友。她年纪约在三十左右一一她自己说是二十六岁。 她的相貌和身材都很不错，只稍嫌胖了些。她年纪轻轻就由亲戚作主，嫁 给一个老商人，那人先在土耳其做生意，后来发了大财，歇业不干了。她 跟这人过了十二年，那段日子里她尽量克制自己，所以她的举止毫无可指 责之处，然而并不是没有痛苦。她的节操得到了报偿：老商人去世后，为 她留下一大笔财产。这时，她守孀将满一年了，这期间基本上离群索居， 只和几个特别要好的朋友会会面，把时光都花在祈祷和看小说上一一她一 向喜欢看小说。她很健壮，人又热情，还笃信宗教，这就使她非再嫁不 可。她决定要按照自己的心意来选择第二个丈夫，正像她是按照亲友们的 心意选择第一个丈夫一样。下面这封短简就是她写给琼斯的：
先生：
自从我第一天见到您，也许我的眼睛就明白告诉了您：我对您并不是冷漠的。我从您住的那家 女眷口里听到您为人高尚善良的生动事例，深信您不但和蔼可亲，而且极可尊敬。倘若没听到 这些，我口中或笔下都不会承认我对您怀有好感。我还欣然听她们说，您对我的品貌及见识也 不讨厌。我手中的积蓄足以使我们二人过得很幸福，然而如果没有您，光有财产我是不会感到 幸福的。我深知世人一定会对我这样冒昧举荐自己加以指责，但倘非我对您的爱慕超过了我对 舆论的畏惧，我就配不上您。唯一使我踌躇的难关是：听说您正在追求一位上流贵妇。倘若您 认为值得为我而牺牲那方面的关系，那么我就是您的了。否则即请忘掉我的软弱，让这件事永 远不为第三者所知。
阿拉贝拉•亨特
琼斯读完这封信，心里激动得怦怦直跳。他正处于逆境，一向供应他 吃穿的那个来源断了。从贝拉斯顿夫人那里拿到的钱，如今总共只剩五个 基尼；而那天早晨一个商人要向他讨还的欠账就有那个数目的两倍。贞洁 的情人已落到她父亲手里，他简直没希望把她救出来。而且靠她过活，花 她那一点点不归她父亲掌握的财产，不但有伤琼斯的自尊心，也违反他对 苏菲亚的情意。亨特太太这笔财产对他来说极为便当，在任何方面她都没
有可挑剔的。恰好相反，除了苏菲亚，他对亨特太太的好感不下于对任何 女人的。然而把苏菲亚丢掉，去娶另外一个女人，这是他万万办不到的。 无论如何他也不肯动这种念头。但是既然苏菲亚明明不可能成为他的人 了，他为什么不可以动动这种念头呢？这样做岂不比让苏菲亚继续坚持这 种毫无指望的爱情对她更仁慈些？出于对苏菲亚的情谊，难道他不应该这 么办吗？这个思绪有一阵子颇占优势。他差点儿从堂而皇之的道义角度决 定背弃苏菲亚了，然而这种高调唱了没多久，就被天性的声音压倒了。这 声音在他心里喊道：这种情谊其实是对爱情的背叛。最后，他喊人拿来 笔、墨水和纸，给亨特太太写了下面这封信：
太太：
来书对我所作的表示是我莫大的荣幸。我目前并没有您信中所提的那种关系。倘若有的 话，我也一定乐于放弃，因为即使那样也不足以报答您的盛情于万一。不过，如果我不告诉您 我的心已别有所属，我就不是您心目中的诚实人了。对方是一位品格极高的小姐。尽管我也许 永远都得不到她，但我无法放弃她。您对我如此之好，倘若我只把手伸给您，而不能把心捧给 您，那对您是不义之举，上帝决不允许。不，我宁可饿死也不愿这么罪过。即使我所爱的人嫁 了旁的人，只要我还没把她忘干净，我也决不同您结婚。请您放心，我对此事将如您一样严守 秘密，决不泄露出去。
您的最感激、最谦卑的仆人，
托•琼斯
我们的主人公写完这封信，派人把它送出之后，就走到他的写字台跟 前，拿出魏斯顿小姐的手笼，一连吻了好几遍。然后，又迈着大步在房间 里兜了几个圈子，比一个爱尔兰人拿到一笔五万镑的财产还要心满意足。
第十二章
巴特里奇的发现
正当琼斯由于意识到自己的忠贞而十分高兴的时候，巴特里奇连跑带 颠地进了房间一一每逢带来（或是他自以为带来）什么好消息，他总是这 个样子。那天早晨他奉了主人之命，去从贝拉斯顿夫人的仆人口中或利用 任何其他办法探听苏菲亚究竟给带到什么地方去了。这时他转回来，面带 喜色地回禀我们的主人公说，他那只失踪的鸟儿找到了。"先生，”他 说，"我已经见到看猎场的黑乔治了，他是乡绅带到京城来的仆人中的一 个。虽然我们多年没见了，可是我一眼就认出他来。先生，您晓得，他真 是个了不起的人；或者说得更清楚一些，他有一副了不起的胡子，那是我 生平看到的最大最黑的了。可是黑乔治过了好一会儿才认出我来。皿那 么，你带来的好消息呢？ ”琼斯嚷道，"关于我的苏菲亚，你知道些什 么先生，马上您就会知道啦，"巴特里奇回答说，"我正赶着说到本题 呢。您这人太性急了。还没讲到祈使句您就问起不定式啦。先生，我刚才 正在说，黑乔治好一阵子才认出我的面孔。皿管你的什么面孔！ ”琼斯嚷 道，"我的苏菲亚怎么啦喏，先生，"巴特里奇回答说，"关于苏菲亚小 姐，我只能就我所知道的告诉您。要不是您总插嘴的话，我早就一古脑儿 告诉您啦。可是您要是老那么气冲冲地瞪着我，就会把这件事从我脑瓜儿 里一一说得更清楚一些，从我的记忆里吓跑了。自从咱们离开厄普顿那天 以来，您从来还没对我这么生气过；我就是活一千岁也不会忘记那一天 的。""好吧，你爱怎么说就怎么说吧，"琼斯说，"我看出你非逼我发疯不 可。""我决没这意思，"巴特里奇回答说，"这方面我吃够了苦头啦。刚才 不是对您说过嘛，我活一天，就一天忘不了。皿那么，黑乔治究竟怎么 啦？ ”琼斯嚷道。"先生，刚才我不是说了嘛，他过了好一阵子才认出我 来。自从上次和他分手以来，我确实变了不少。Non sum qualis eram.四 我也是饱经沧桑啦，再没有比忧伤更能改变一个人的了。我听说人的头发 一夜之间就可以改变颜色。不管怎么样，最后他总算认出我来了，真的。 我们俩同岁，并且同在一个慈善学堂里念过书。乔治是个大笨蛋，不过， 这倒没什么关系。人发不发迹，并不在乎有没有学问。我相信我这话是有 道理的。再过一千年就什么都一样了。哦，先生，我扯到哪儿啦？一一 噢，对啦，我们俩彼此一认出来，热烈地握了一阵手，就一道去酒馆里喝
了一通一一真幸运，我到京城以后还没尝过那么好的啤酒。喏，先生，现 在说到正文了。我刚一提起您，并且告诉他说，我是跟您一道来京城的， 一直跟您住在一起，他就又要来一壶酒，一定要为您的健康干杯。他饮得 那么热烈，看到世上竟有这么感恩报德的人，我心里可快活了。我们干了 那壶之后，我又要来一壶。我们又为您的健康干杯。然后，我就赶快跑回 来向您报告这个消息。”
"什么消息？”琼斯嚷道，"你一个字儿也还没提到我的苏菲亚呢。""哎 呀，我几乎把这件事给忘了。我们确实谈了半天魏斯顿小姐的事儿。乔治 统统告诉我了：布利非先生特意到京城来和她成亲。我对他说，布利非最 好还是赶快办这件事，要不然呀，别人就抢在他前头了。我还说，西格里 姆先生，另外那人得不到苏菲亚小姐，真是一万个可惜，因为我敢说，那 人在世界上最爱的就是这位小姐了。我希望你和魏斯顿小姐都晓得，那人 并不是为了小姐的财产而追求她。说到财产，我可以老实告诉你，另外有 个身份更高、财产更多的女人非常喜欢那人，她白天黑夜地来找他。”
这时，琼斯对巴特里奇发了脾气，说他出卖了自己。但是这个可怜的 汉子说，他并没提名道姓啊。"而且，先生，"他说，"您放心，乔治是您的 真心朋友。他不止一次咒骂布利非先生。他甚至还说，只要他能做到的 事，他都愿意替您效劳。我也相信他不是空口说白话的。出卖了您！这话 说得倒好！世上除了我之外，我不信您还能找到一个比乔治更贴心的朋 友，一个愿意全心全意为您效劳的人了。”
"好吧，”琼斯的气消了一些，"我也相信这个家伙很肯帮我的忙。那 么，你说他跟苏菲亚住在同一幢房子里吗？"
"当然喽！"巴特里奇回答说。"喏，先生，他是那家的一个用人呀，而 且，我敢说，穿得很考究呢。要不是留了那副黑胡子，您未必认得出他 Th- 〃
来。
"那么他起码可以替我做一件事，"琼斯说，"他总可以替我交一封信给 我的苏菲亚。”
"您这件事提得ad unguem丝，"巴特里奇嚷道，"我怎么没想到哇？ 好，只要您吩咐一声，我敢保他立即照办。”
"好，"琼斯说，"那么请你暂时离开一会儿。我去写封信，明天早晨你
交给他。你大概晓得到哪儿去找他吧。”
"晓得的，先生，"巴特里奇回答说，"我一定会再找到他，您放心。那 家的酒太好了，他一定很快还会去的。只要他在京城里住一天，我相信他 天天会去的。”
"这么说来，你并不晓得我的苏菲亚住在哪条街上啊！"琼斯嚷道。
"先生，我真的晓得，"巴特里奇说。
"叫什么名字？"琼斯嚷道。
"名字吗，先生？"巴特里奇说，"先生，离这儿反正不远，也就隔上一 两条街。名字我倒不晓得，因为他从没告诉过我。要是我一问，先生，那 又会引起他的疑心。不，不，交给我去办吧，先生。您放心，我再机灵不 过。”
"你确实机灵透顶啦，"琼斯回答说，"不管怎样，我决定给我心上的那 个人儿写封信，因为我相信明天你总可以凭你的机灵在那家酒馆里找到黑 乔治。”
琼斯先生把精明的巴特里奇打发走之后，就坐下来写信。我们暂时先 离开他，让他写下去。第十五卷也就在这里结束。

第十六卷
历时五天的经过
第一章
论开场白
我听一位剧作家常说，他宁可写一部戏，也不愿意写一篇开场白。同 样，我想我写这部历史每卷的正文比写每卷的序章用的气力要少。
老实说，我相信首先创始在剧本前面写上一段所谓开场白的办法的作 家，一定遭到许多人的痛骂。这种开场白最初原是剧本正文的一部分，可 是近年来它与后面的戏本身往往没有多大关联，以致一个剧本的开场白也 大可以放在其他任何剧本前面。现今的开场白似乎都在同样的三个题目上 作文章：谩骂京城人士的鉴赏力，斥责当代所有的作家，为正要上演的剧 本大肆捧场。这些开场白的论调很少变化，它们也不可能有什么变化。说 实在的，我对这些作者的别出心裁往往感到惊奇，他们竟能找到那么不同 的词句来表达同一套东西。
同样，我担心将来也许某一位历史家（如果承他不弃来模仿我的写法 的话）挠了一阵头皮之后，会由于我首创这种序章而祝愿［1］起我来。就像当 代剧本的开场白一样，我这些序章大部分都可以放在这部历史任何一卷的 前头，或者放在任何其他一部历史前头。
但是不论开场白和序章这两种创举会使作者多么伤脑筋，读者将从这 些序章中充分获得好处，正像观众早已从开场白中受益一样。
首先，大家都晓得这些开场白正可以给剧评家一个机会来试试喝倒彩 的本事，把猫哨⑵的音节调好，让它发挥最大的威力。据我所知，这些乐器 就这样准备得停停当当，幕一开启，即齐声合奏。
批评家也总可以从这些序章里得到同样的便利一一他一定会抓到一些 能磨砺他的高贵精神的东西，好更加不依不饶地来对这部历史本身进行攻 讦。以批评家的明达，也不需要为他指出：为了便于批评家开刀，这些序 章安排得多么巧妙，因为里面我们总是特意放进一些酸味或酸性的东西， 以便激发和加强上述批评精神。
同时，那些懒散的读者和观众也从中发现很大好处。既然他们不一定 非听开场白或者读序章不可，而有了这种东西以后，戏和小说前头都延长 了-段时间，观众就可以利用台上说开场白的时候多在餐桌上耽搁一刻 钟，读者也不必从小说的第一页开始，而从第四五页读起就成了。在那些 看书只不过是为了可以对人说"我也读过哩”的人来说，这个便利真是非同
小可。而抱这样目的读书的，要比一般估计的来得普遍。不但法典和其他 有益的书，甚至荷马、维吉尔、斯威夫特和塞万提斯的著作往往也是这么 翻翻而已。
此外，开场白和序章还有旁的许多好处，但大都是显而易见的，这里 恕不一一枚举了；尤其因为我们都想到：开场白和序章的主要优点正在于 简短。
第二章
乡绅魏斯顿遇到的一件令人啼笑皆非的事;苏菲亚所处的困境
现在我们必须把读者领到魏斯顿先生在皮卡迪利的寓所去。他是经海 德公园拐角赫剌克勒斯柱石旅馆老板的推荐住到这里的。他把马安顿在他 到京城后看到的头一家旅店里，而把他自己安顿在他听到的头一座公寓 里。
苏菲亚从贝拉斯顿夫人家坐出租马车来到这里。下车后，她要求到给 她准备好的那个房间里去休息。她父亲马上同意了，并且亲自陪她前往。 父女之间交谈了几句，话既不重要，逐字重复一遍读者也不会感到愉快。 总之，乡绅恶狠狠地逼女儿答应跟布利非成亲。他还告诉苏菲亚说，布利 非几天之内就要到京城来了。但是苏菲亚非但没有同意，反而比以前更加 斩钉截铁地坚决拒绝了这门亲事。这下子她父亲发起火来，赌了一通咒， 说不管她愿不愿意，也非要她嫁给布利非不可。然后就骂不绝口地走了出 去，锁上房内，把钥匙放在衣兜里。
这时，苏菲亚就像单独囚禁的国事重犯一样，除了火炉和蜡烛之外， 别无伴侣。乡绅则和那位牧师以及赫剌克勒斯柱石旅馆的老板一道吃起酒 来。乡绅认为把这位老板邀来很好，因为他可以谈谈京城里的各种时事新 闻。乡绅说，老板的旅馆里停有这么多达官贵人的马，他的消息当然很灵 通。
魏斯顿在这两位情投意合的朋友陪伴之下，度过了一晚和次日的大半 天，这段时间里没发生什么值得在本书中一提的事。苏菲亚照旧是被独自 关在房里，她父亲发誓在她同意嫁给布利非之前，决不放她活着出去。而 且除了给她送饭（这种时候他总是亲自在旁监视），房内决不开锁。
在乡绅来到京城的次晨，正当他和牧师吃着烤面包，喝着啤酒的时 候，有人告诉他楼下有一位上流人要见他。
"上流人！"乡绅说，"是个什么家伙呢？牧师，请你下楼看看究竟是 谁。布利非先生不至于这么快就来啦。请下去一趟吧，看看他有什么事 儿。”
牧师回来向他报告说，来的人装束很讲究，从他帽上的缎带看来，大 概是个陆军军官。他说他有一件重要事情，必须和魏斯顿先生面谈。
"一个军官！"乡绅嚷道，"这种人能跟我有什么关系？要是他想征用车 辆去运行李的话，我又不是这儿的保安官，我不能给他开准许证。既然他 非见我不可，就叫他上楼来吧。”
这时，一位十分文雅的男人走了进来。寒暄了几句，他就要求单独和 乡绅会见。然后就这样说明来意：
"先生，我是奉费拉玛勋爵之命拜望您来的。那天晚上的事件发生之 后，您想必也有所预料。不过，我想向您传达的话，和您所预料的很不一 样。”
"什么勋爵？"乡绅问道，"我从来没听说过这个名字。”
"只要您稍微认一下错，"那人说，"勋爵大人可以把一切都归咎于酒后 失言，不再计较了。他十分爱慕您的小姐，所以，他决不愿意因为受到您 的冒犯而发怒。勋爵大人曾公开多次表现过他的勇气叫所以不再追究这件 事也不至于损害他的荣誉，这是你们双方的幸运。因此，他所希望的只是 要您在我面前道一道歉一一只要简简单单地表示一声就行了。勋爵大人打 算今天下午来拜望您，向您请求准许他向您的小姐表示爱慕之情。”
"先生，我不大懂得你说的话，"乡绅说，"不过，既然你提到我的女 儿，我想大概就是我的表妹贝拉斯顿夫人所说的那位勋爵吧；她说过那位 勋爵向我女儿求婚之类的事。要是这样的话，不管这件事是怎么闹的，反 正请你转告你们勋爵说，咱这闺女已经有了主儿啦。”
"先生，"那人说，"您恐怕还不充分了解这是多么难得的一门亲事。我 相信以勋爵大人这样的人品、爵位和财产，哪里也不会有人拒绝的。”
"咱们干脆把话说清楚了吧，"乡绅回答说，"我的女儿早已许配给人 啦。即便还没有，我也决不肯把她嫁给一个贵族。所有的贵族我都讨厌。 他们都是一群吃宫廷饭的，都是汉诺威王室的，我不和他们打交道。”
"好吧，"那人说，"既然您这么决定了，我就代表勋爵请您今天早晨到 海德公园去和他见面。”
"你可以告诉勋爵，"乡绅说，"我很忙，不能去。我家里事情就够忙的 了，没工夫出去遛腿。”
"先生，"那人说，"我相信您十分重视自己的荣誉，不会让我带回这么 个答复。我相信，您决不甘愿旁人这么议论您：侮辱了一位贵族，而又不 接受他的挑战。勋爵大人十分尊重小姐，本来可以用另一种办法了结这件
事的；但是除非他把您当作岳父来看待，否则，为了维护个人荣誉，他不 能轻易放过这样一次侮辱一一您当然应该清楚，您曾给过他侮辱。”
“我给过他侮辱！ ”乡绅嚷道，"妈的，那是撒谎。我什么也没给过 他。”
听到这话，那人口头上申斥了两声，同时，也做出了相应的手势。可 敬的乡绅魏斯顿先生一听到这种语言，立刻气得满屋子里乱蹦乱跳，同时 还使勤叫喊，仿佛很想招一大帮人来欣赏他敏捷的动作。
牧师丢下大半杯没喝完的啤酒，正在左近呆着。一听乡绅叫喊，他马 上跑了过来，问道："哎呀，先生，怎么啦？""怎么啦？"乡绅说，"这准是 个强盗。他要害我的命，抢我的钱财，因为我什么也没招惹他，他举着拐 杖向我扑过来啦。"
"哦，"那位大尉说，"你不是说我撒谎吗？"
"对天起誓，我没有，"乡绅说，"我也许说过'要是说我给过勋爵侮辱， 那是撒谎'，可我从来也没说过'你撒谎'。我是不会随口乱说的，你也不该轻 举妄动，向一个赤手空拳的人动武。要是我手里也有根拐杖，你也就不敢 打我啦。我会给你那瘦脸蛋一个耳刮子。咱们立刻到院子里去，看谁能一 棍子把对手的脑袋开了瓢。要不，咱们就找一间空屋子，我痛揍你的肚 子。你连半个人也算不上，差得远哩！”
那位大尉悻悻地回答说："先生，我看出你是个不值得一理的人。我也 要报告勋爵说，你是不值得他一理的人。为了打你，可惜还脏了我的手指 头呢。"说完这话他就走了。牧师拉住乡绅，免得他堵住大尉的去路。牧师 倒没费多大劲，因为尽管乡绅也作出拦阻的姿态，然而并不那么坚决，非 堵住大尉不可。可是等大尉走掉了，乡绅才追在屁股后头又是咒骂又是恫 吓一一但是这些话他是等那位军官下了楼才出口的。军官走得越远，他嚷 的嗓音越大。军官大概根本没听到，反正并不曾使他停留下来。
可怜囚禁中的苏菲亚从头到尾听到了她父亲的叫喊。这时，她先跺 脚，然后又像老乡绅那样嚷了起来一一只是嗓音好听多了。这一喊，倒使 乡绅安静下来，把心思又全转移到他的女儿身上。他非常疼爱苏菲亚，一 想到女儿会遭到哪怕是一点点损害，他也立刻就焦灼万分。除了这件关系 到她终身幸福的大事以外，什么事他都依着苏菲亚的心愿。
乡绅朝大尉发完脾气（还赌咒要同他打官司）之后，就上楼看他女儿 来了。他开了锁，一推门，就看见苏菲亚面色苍白，声嘶力竭。苏菲亚看
到她父亲，立刻振作起精神，抓住他的手，激动地嚷道："啊，亲爱的爹， 快把我吓死了 ！但愿您没受到什么伤害。皿没有，没有，"乡绅大声 说，"没受多大伤。那个流氓没怎么伤着我。但是我要不把他告下来，我就 不是人。""请问，亲爱的爹，"她说，"告诉我怎么了？刚才欺负您的那个 人是谁？皿我不晓得那家伙叫什么，”魏斯顿回答说，"大概是个军官吧 ――咱们纳税养着他，就是为了挨他揍的！要是这家伙有家当的话，我就 叫他赔偿我挨的这一下一一我看他啥也没有。别看他穿得这么整齐，我不 相信他有一分半分田地。""可是亲爱的爹，"苏菲亚大声说，"您是为什么 跟他吵起来的呢？""为什么，苏菲？还不是为了你，苏菲！ ”乡绅回答 说，"我倒霉全是为了你。早晚你会送掉你老子的命的。瞧，一个鸟贵族， —个什么勋爵！他看中了你，因为我不答应，他就向我挑战决斗。喏，苏 菲，做个乖闺女，结束你老爹的一切烦恼，务必同意嫁给他吧。他一两天 就到京城来。只要你答应我，他一来你就跟他结婚，你就叫我成为世上顶 幸福的人了，我也一定叫你成为世上顶幸福的女人。我要给你在伦敦置办 最考究的衣服，买最贵重的首饰，还给你一套六马高车随你使用。我已经 答应奥尔华绥把家里的田产给你一半――他妈的，全给你我也舍得！""爹 肯听我说话吗？”她说。"苏菲，这还用得着问吗？"乡绅嚷道，"你明明晓 得你的声音比英国最精壮的一群猎犬发出的音乐还要好听哩。肯不肯听你 讲！我的宝贝小妞儿，但愿我活一天，就永远听到你的声音；要是失掉了 这份快乐，我片刻也活不下去了。真的，苏菲，你不知道我有多么疼爱 你，你真不知道，不然的话，你也就不会逃跑，丢下你可怜的爹；在这世 界上，他除了他的小苏菲就再也没有旁的快乐，旁的安慰了。"说到这儿， 他眼眶里噙着泪水。苏菲亚也泪如雨下，回答说："亲爱的爹，我当然晓得 您是疼爱我的；上天可以证明，我也是多么真心实意地爱着您。要不是为 了怕您逼我嫁给那个人，任何旁的事情都不会使我从我爹身边逃掉；我是 那么深深爱着您，为了您的幸福，我甘愿牺牲自己的性命。我甚至曾想到 要说服自己更进一步，为了听从您的意旨几乎下决心去忍受人世间最悲惨 的生活。可是只有这一点我没法勉强我自己，而且永远也办不到。”这时 候，乡绅眼睛里又冒了火，嘴上喷着泡沫。苏菲亚看到这情景，就央求让 她把话讲完。于是，她又继续说下去："要是爹的生命、健康或切身幸福的 任何方面到了危急关头，您这个有决心的女儿就站在这儿哪。为了保全您 老人家，如果有什么罪我不肯受，就叫我天打雷劈！……不，连那最可
憎、最难堪的命运我也接受下来！我会为了保全您而答应嫁给布利 非。""告诉你吧，"做父亲的回答说，"你这么一来就真的保全我了。保全 了我的健康、幸福、生命和一切了。老实说，你要不答应我这件事，我就 活不成了。我的心会碎的，真的，一定会碎的。""难道您就这么想叫我受 罪吗？”她说。"我跟你说，"乡绅大声回答说，"为了你的幸福，世上要是 有什么事我不肯做，那就叫我死后下地狱。""那么我亲爱的爹肯不肯让我 稍稍明白什么才会使我幸福呢？ ”苏菲亚说，"必须本人认为幸福才算是幸 福一一事实若确是如此的话，那么当我认为自己是天地间最不幸的人时， 我的情况能说是幸福的吗？ 我宁可要你那么认为，也比让你嫁给一个穷 私生子、浪荡汉去寻求幸福强，"乡绅说。"爹，"苏菲亚说，"要是您乐意 的话，我情愿向您庄严保证，决不嫁给那个人；只要爹活着一天，没您的 同意，我也不嫁给任何人。请让我把终生献给您，服侍您。我还是做您的 可怜的苏菲吧，让我像以前那样把迎合您的心意、给您开心解闷作为我毕 生的职责和享受吧。""苏菲，你听着，"乡绅说，"你想这么把我蒙混过去 可不成。那样一来，你姑姑魏斯顿就会认为她把我当傻瓜看待是有道理的 了。不，不，苏菲，我要你晓得我是精明强干，很熟悉人情世故，决不会 在牵涉到男人的事情上去信任女人的。""怎么，爹，您凭什么对我这么不 信任起来？”她说，"我对您失过一次信吗？或者从落生到今天，我可曾欺 骗过您一次苏菲，你听着，"乡绅大声说，"我不管那一套。这门亲事 我已经决定了，反正你得嫁给他，你非嫁他不可。哪怕第二天早晨你就上 吊，也得嫁。"他一边来回重复这句话，一边攥住拳头，皱紧眉头，还咬着 嘴唇。他那么暴跳如雷，把可怜的受尽折磨的苏菲亚吓得哆哆嗦嗦地倒在 椅子上了 ；她要不是立刻泪如雨下，略得缓解，说不定还会发生更坏的 事。
看到女儿这样悲伤的情景，魏斯顿就像新门狱吏看到一个温柔的妻子 和她被判死刑的丈夫抱头痛哭着永别时那么无动于衷；或者说，他对她就 像一个公正诚实的商人眼看着一个债户为了十镑钱（这笔债务是确凿的， 可那个可怜虫就是还不出）而被拖入牢狱时那么冷漠。或者用一个更近似 的比喻：他感到的不安也就相当于一个看见自己骗到手的可怜的黄花姑娘 初次听到接客而惊慌失措时的老鸨。这个比喻本来可以很恰当，只是老鸨 逼姑娘接客是有利可图的，而做父亲的逼女儿去干这种和卖淫相差无几的
勾当（尽管他也许糊里糊涂地以为并非如此），实际上却什么好处也捞不 到。
乡绅就在这种情况下离开了他可怜的苏菲亚，临走还对眼泪的效用说 了几句十分粗鄙的话。他又锁上了房内，找牧师去了。牧师竭力替小姐分 辩，凡是他敢讲的话都讲了一一也许按照职责来说，他讲的还不够充分， 然而却已经足够使乡绅大发雷霆的了。他用许多不堪入耳的话把所有的牧 师都骂了一顿。我们十分尊敬这些从事圣职的人，所以恕不把那番咒骂写 到纸上了。
第三章
苏菲亚在禁闭中遇到的事
乡绅住的那家公寓的老板娘老早就对这家房客感到奇怪。不过既然她 听说乡绅是位大财主，她又在房租上敲了他不少竹杠，所以她认为不宜于 去冒犯。尽管她从自家女仆那里听说苏菲亚性格多么温柔，为人和蔼可亲 （这话也得到了乡绅带来的仆人们一致的证实），因而对可怜的苏菲亚被 囚禁起来这件事也颇为关怀，然而她更关怀的还是自己的利益，决不想去 惹这位据她说是一看就是个性子暴戾的绅士。
虽然苏菲亚吃得很少，可是每顿饭都给她送去。我甚至相信，倘若她 想吃什么珍馐，虽然乡绅那么生她的气，也会不怕麻烦，不惜金钱替她弄 到的；因为说来有些读者会觉得很奇怪，乡绅确实钟爱他这个女儿，他把 让女儿高兴看作人生的莫大快乐。
开饭的时候到了。黑乔治给她送来一只小母鸡，乡绅亲自守着门，他 发誓决不把钥匙交给任何人。乔治放下那盘菜之后，苏菲亚跟他说了几句 客气话。（自从苏菲亚离开乡下以来，黑乔治这是头一次看到她。苏菲亚 对每个仆人都很有礼貌，不像有些人对身份稍稍比他们低一些的人就露出 轻慢来。）苏菲亚要他把子鸡端走，说她吃不下去，可是乔治劝她还是尝 尝看。他特别劝她吃吃填在鸡肚子里的蛋。
这当儿，乡绅一直守在门口。但是乔治是魏斯顿眼里的红人，因为他 干的是上等差事一一管狩猎，所以经常可以随便一些。他主动要求替苏菲 亚端饭，他说他很想见见小姐。因此，他跟苏菲亚相互寒暄着，毫不在乎 地让主子在门口站着等上不止十分钟。出来的时候，在门口也只挨了乡绅 一声逗趣般的呵责。
乔治一向晓得苏菲亚最爱吃鸡蛋和鹧鸪、山雉等的蛋。他心肠又好； 如今，寓所里的仆人都在担心小姐会饿死（她已经有四十个钟头没吃一口 东西了），也难怪他要替苏菲亚准备这份美味了。
悲伤对一般人和对一个寡妇所起的作用不同，悲伤往往比班斯蒂德高 地四或索尔兹伯里平原的空气更能刺激寡妇的食欲。尽管如此，可是连感受 最深切悲哀的人，毕竟还是要吃东西的一一虽然有些人持相反的看法。于 是，苏菲亚想了一阵，就开始切那只鸡。鸡肚里果然像乔治所说的，填满 了蛋。
如果苏菲亚喜欢蛋，这只鸡肚里另外还装着一种东西足以使皇家协会§ 更加高兴哩。因为如果三只脚的飞禽是件无价之宝的话（说不定自古以来 已经出现过上千只这样的鸟了），那么倘若一只禽完全打破动物的生理规 律，肚子里竟然会有一封书信，我们又将对它作出怎样的估价呢？奥维德 告诉我们，阿铿托斯［6］所变的那朵花的花瓣上长着字母，维吉尔曾把此事作 为奇迹推荐给他当时的皇家协会。然而任何时代，任何国家都还没见过一 只嗉囊里带着一封书信的禽哩。
尽管这一奇迹即使全欧各国的科学学会一起出动调查，也不会有什么 结果，可是读者只消回忆一下琼斯和巴特里奇两位先生上次那段交谈，就 不难猜出这封信是来自何处，它又如何跑到这只鸡的肚子里去了。
苏菲亚虽然好久没进食了，而且摆在面前的又是她最心爱的美味，可 是一瞥见那封信，她就一把抓住，把它拆开了。信里这样写道：
小姐：
倘若我不晓得此信是写给谁，不管怎样吃力，我也会把听到昂诺尔大姐叙述你的近况时 我心里的惊惧之感描绘下来。既然天下只有有情人才能真正了解有情人心灵上所感到的痛苦， 那么我的苏菲亚情深意挚，一定可以料到她的琼斯听到这令人忧伤的消息时心里有多么悲痛。 当我听说你遭到不幸时，世上有什么能使我更加痛苦呢？只有一件事，而我也正是为此而诅咒 自己。苏菲亚，这就是不寒而栗地想到你正是为了我才遭到这些不幸。我这样说也许是过于恭 维自己了，然而我为这份恭维所付的代价是极大的，谁也不会嫉妒我。请恕我如此冒昧。更冒 昧的是我想问你一下究竟怎样才可以给你一些安慰：我给你出些主意？我给你支援？我来到你 身边？我离去？还是我死去或是受折磨？最倾心的钦慕、最细腻的体贴、最炽热的爱、最深切 的柔情和对你的意志死心塌地的屈从，能不能补偿你为我的幸福而作出的牺牲呢？要是能的 话，就飞来吧，我可爱的天使，飞到我这永远张开、等待你并且保护你的双臂里，不管你是空 着手，还是带了世上的财宝，这区别在我是不值得理会的。如果不是这样，而理智占了上风， 经过更成熟的考虑，认为这样牺牲太大了 ；或者除了丢弃我，再没有旁的办法与你的父亲和 解，并且使你的心情宁静下来，那么我就祈求你下定决心，把我从你的思念中永远驱逐出去， 毫不要由于同情我的遭遇而使你的柔肠再加重负担。小姐，请你相信，我由衷地爱你胜过我自 己，所以我最大、最主要的目的就是你的幸福。我生平第一个愿望（为什么命运不肯让我得到 满足？）曾经是一一请原谅我，如果我说现在仍然是：时时刻刻看到你是个最幸福的女人。如 果做不到，那么我第二个愿望就是间接听到你生活得幸福。不过，世上最使我痛心疾首的，莫 如当我发现由于自己的缘故而使你感到须臾的不安。
小姐，我在一切意义上、一切方面都是你的一一全心全意的
托马斯•琼斯
接到这封信之后苏菲亚的言谈、举止和思绪如何，以及这封信她看了 多少遍，是不是不止一遍，这些情况都让读者凭自己的想象去推敲吧。读 者以后也许会看到苏菲亚的回信，目前还不行，理由之一是她并没写；这 也有若干充分的原因，其中之一是她没有纸、笔和墨水。
傍晚，当苏菲亚正在那里思索着收到的这封信或旁的什么的时候，突 然楼下一阵大吵大嚷，打断了她的沉思。原来两个人在舌战。苏菲亚从嗓 音分辨，马上听出交战的一方是她父亲，但她并没马上听出那尖细些的声 音是她姑姑嚷出来的。魏斯顿女士是刚到京城的。她有个仆人也住在赫剌 克勒斯柱石旅馆，那人告诉了她乡绅的地址。魏斯顿女士立刻乘着车子来 到她哥哥的寓所。
所以我们就和苏菲亚暂时告别，像往常那样彬彬有礼地伴随在这位女 士左右。
第四章
苏菲亚获得释放
乡绅和牧师（旅馆老板这时另有贵干）正一道吸烟的当儿，有人报知 魏斯顿女士来了。乡绅一听到她的名字，马上就奔下去接她上楼。原来乡 绅非常讲究这套礼节，尤其对他妹妹一一在人世间，乡绅最怕的就是他这 个妹妹，可是他决不会承认这一点，也许他自己也不知道。
魏斯顿女士一进饭厅，就倒在一把椅子上，这样讲开了 ："哎，这一路 上真够人受的。立了那么多法案来征收养路税，路反而一天比一天糟啦。 呃，哥哥，你怎么挑了这么个破地方来住？我敢说，有身份的人从来也没 进过这所房子。""我也说不上来，"乡绅说，"我看还凑合嘛。是旅馆的老 板推荐的。我当时想，既然大部分上流人他都认识，他一定能够替我选个 地方，以便让我和那些上流人混在一起。皿那么，我的侄女呢？ ”她问 道，"你去拜望过贝拉斯顿夫人了吗？""嗯，嗯，"乡绅大声说，"你侄女安 全得很，她在楼上房间里呢。""怎么？”她问道，"我侄女在这里，她却不 晓得我来啦谁也休想见着她，"乡绅说，"因为我把她锁在房里了。这 下可把她安置妥当了。我来到京城以后，当天晚上就从表妹那里把她接出 来，从那以后一直由我看管着她。如今，你放心吧，她就像一只装进口袋 里的狐狸，决跑不了。皿哎呀，我的天！ ”魏斯顿女士说，"这成什么话 啦！我当时同意你独自到京城来，还以为你会干得很漂亮呢。自然，当初 是你硬要这么做，并不能怨我同意你一个人来了。哥哥，你不是答应我决 不固执己见，采取这种粗暴办法吗？难道不正是这种办法才把侄女逼得从 乡下逃跑出来的吗？你是不是成心想逼她再逃跑一回？皿妈的，活见 鬼！"乡绅把烟斗往地上一丢，大声嚷道。"这真是胡说八道！我办了这么 多事，满心以为你会夸奖我，没料到你会这样朝我发作一顿！皿哦，哥 哥！"女士说，"我几时叫你有过一点点根据，以为我会夸奖你把自己的女 儿锁起来？难道我不曾多次告诉过你，自由国土上的妇女不能任凭你对她 们这么横行霸道。我们跟男人是同样自由的一一我恨不得能够说，我们妇 女比男人更配享受自由。如果你还想要我在这座破房子里停留一会儿，要 我还认你是我的哥哥，要我还来过问你的家务事，那么你就非立刻把我的 侄女放出来不可。"说这话的时候她背朝着火，一只手放在身后，另一只手
捏着一撮鼻烟，神情是那样威严，我想就是率领亚马孙女杰的塔丽丝特里
斯［7］也未必有这种气势。这就难怪可怜的乡绅经不起这么一吓。"拿去！"他 把钥匙丢下，嚷道，"给你，随你办吧。本来我也只是打算把她关到布利非 来的时候就放出来，时候不会很长的。要是这段时间里出了什么岔子，别 忘记该怪谁。”
"我以性命担保，"魏斯顿女士大声说，"可是有一个条件：你得把这件 事全权交给我办理，不然的话我就根本不来插手。除非经我委派，此外， 什么你也不许过问。哥哥，要是你同意这个先决条件的话，我就尽我的力 量来保全一下你家的体面。不然的话，我就仍然严守中立。”
"我的好先生，"牧师说，"求您这回听姑奶奶的话。说不定她用道理去 劝劝苏菲亚小姐，会比您用强硬手段更有效果呢。”
“你乱说些什么！ ”乡绅嚷道，"你要是再开口，我马上就用鞭子抽 你。”
"呸，哥哥，"她说，"你能对教士这么讲话吗？撒波尔先生很有见识， 他对你的劝告都是极好的。我相信全世界都会赞同他的看法。不过，对我 刚才提的那个斩钉截铁的建议，你必须立刻给个答复。要么把你的女儿交 给我一手办理，要么就完全交给你，任凭你用那种骇人听闻的办法去处 理；那样的话，我就当着撒波尔先生的面撤出阵地，从此和你以及你这一 家断绝关系。”
"请让我当个调解人，"牧师大声说，"我恳求您两位……”
"哼，钥匙在桌上哪，"乡绅嚷道，"她高兴的话就拿去吧，谁又拦她 呢！ ”
"哥哥，不成，"女士说，"你一定得完全按照割让所有权的一切规定手 续把钥匙正式移交给我。”
"好，就交给你吧……喏，给你这钥匙，"乡绅大声说，"妹妹，我想你 总不会怪我没把女儿委托给你过吧。每回她都是同你住上一年多，我一眼 也看不到她。”
"要是一直跟我住下去，她还会更福气呢，"她说，"在我眼底下根本不 会发生这种事儿。”
"当然是这样，"他嚷道，"只能怪我。”
"喏，当然怪你，"她回答说，"过去我不得不这么说，以后也要经常这 么说。不过，我希望你今后改正过来，从以往的错误里吸取教训，免得你
乱搞一气又破坏了我的妙计。哥哥，你真是不宜于办这类交涉。你的整个 政策全不对头。我再一次坚持你不要插手这件事，记住过去发生的事……”
"妈的，真是活见鬼！"乡绅嚷道，"妹妹，我怎么说才合你的心意呢？ 你会把魔鬼都惹火！”
"瞧，你那老一套又拿出来啦，"她说，"哥哥，我看同你是谈不出什么 道理来的。撒波尔牧师是有见地的，请问，我可曾说了什么足以令任何人 气恼的话？可是哥哥，你处处都是个死顽固！”
"姑奶奶，我恳求您不要惹乡绅发脾气了，"牧师说。
"惹他发脾气？"这位女士说，"您可跟他一样是个傻瓜。得啦，哥哥， 既然你答应不再插手，那么侄女的事就再一次由我来主持吧！哎呀，什么 事一落到男人手里，那就只有求老天保佑了 ！一个女人的头脑抵得上你们 —千个男人的。"说完这话，她就喊一个仆人在前边引路，带着钥匙找苏菲 亚去了。
她刚一走，乡绅先关上门，然后一连说了二十声"母狗”，还痛骂了二 十声别的话。尽管他在妹妹的财产上打过算盘，也顾不得口下留情了。不 过，随后他又说道："既然为着她那笔财产低声下气这么些年了，要是由于 不能再多坚持一阵而丢掉它，那就太可惜啦。反正这母狗终归有死的一 天，我准知道凭她的遗嘱，那份产业已经是我的了。”
牧师十分称赞乡绅这个主意。这时，乡绅又叫人拿来一瓶酒。这是他 一贯的办法：每当他有点什么顺心或苦恼事情的时候，他总要足足喝一通 这种祛病延年的饮料。这样，当魏斯顿女士领着苏菲亚回到房里来的时 候，他的肝火早已冲掉，又变得心平气和了。小姐披着戴风帽的斗篷。做 姑妈的告诉乡绅，她打算把侄女带到自己的寓所去。她说："真的，哥哥， 这种地方简直不是人住的。”
"一切都随你的便吧，"魏斯顿回答说，"姑娘在你手里就再妥当没有 了。牧师可以替我证明，背着你面我说你是世界上最有见识的女人，这话 我足足说了五十遍。”
"这一点我愿意作见证，"牧师说。
"啊，哥哥，"魏斯顿女士说，"我一向也总是称赞你的人品。你总得承 认你的性情偏乎急躁。不过，要是你肯好好动动脑筋，简直再也没有你这 么通情达理的了。”
"妹妹，"乡绅说，"既然你这么想，那我就诚心诚意祝你健康。我偶尔 会发点儿脾气，可我从来也不记仇。苏菲，做个乖'|'头，好好听你姑姑的 话啊！”
"这一点我是丝毫也不怀疑的，"魏斯顿女士回答说，"她堂姐哈丽特那 个贱人就是她的前车之鉴，哈丽特不听我的话，结果，毁掉了终身。噢， 哥哥，你猜怎么着？那天你刚刚动身到伦敦来，没走出多远，那个有着一 个讨厌的爱尔兰姓的无礼家伙一一那个费兹帕特利就来了。他没经通报就 闯了进来，不然的话，我才不接见他呢。他乱七八糟讲了一大堆他妻子的 事情，非要我听下去不可。我没怎么搭腔，只把他妻子的信递给他，吩咐 他自己去答复。我估计那个贱人一定很想找到咱们，我求你不要接见她， 反正我是无论如何也不会理她的。”
"接见她！"乡绅说，"这你用不着担心。我决不会去纵容这种不听话的 ''头的。她丈夫来的那天我不在家，算他走运。不然的话，我准叫这狗养 的在洗马池里淹个半死。苏菲，你看，忤逆不孝有什么好下场！家里就有 这个现成的例子。”
"哥哥，”做姑妈的嚷道，"你用不着重复这种讨厌事儿来吓唬我的侄 女。你为什么不把事情完全交给我？""好吧，好吧，全交给你啦，"乡绅 说。
苏菲亚的运气总算还不错：如今她姑妈吩咐人去备轿子，这么一来谈 话就中断了。我所以说她运气不错，是因为如果谈话继续下去的话，保不 住会发生新的争执。他们兄妹之间只在教养和性别上有区别，两人的性格 同样暴躁，也同样固执己见。他们都十分疼爱苏菲亚，同时，相互间怀着 莫大的轻蔑。
第五章
琼斯接到苏菲亚的一封信，他陪密勒太太和巴特里奇一道去看戏
正当琼斯为苏菲亚焦灼不安的时候，黑乔治来到了京城，并且答应替 他旧时的恩人效劳，这样一来，琼斯感到很大的快慰。他就通过这个乔 治，收到苏菲亚下面这封回信。这是苏菲亚离开那个禁闭的地方，重获自 由和使用笔、墨水和纸的权利以后，当晚写的：
先生：
既然我相信您来信中的话都是真挚的，我想您一定乐于知道：由于我魏斯顿姑姑来京， 我的苦难一部分已得到解除。目前，我正与她住在一起，享受一切我所希望享受的自由。姑姑 坚决要我答应:事先没告诉她并得到她的同意，我不能接见任何人或同任何人来往。我已经郑 重地对她许下诺言，并且一定要严格履行。尽管我姑姑没明言禁止我写信，那想必是她忘记提 了，要不然就是包括在来往这个词儿里了。总之，我只能把这样私自通信看作辜负她对我宽厚 的信任的不义行为。所以接此信后，希望您不要期待我今后还会继续背着她与您书信往还。对 我说来，诺言是神圣的东西，不论讲明的还是不言而喻的事情，都应当包括在内。如果您寻思 一下，也许可以从这一点上得到一些安慰。可是我何必向您提到这种安慰呢？虽然有一件事我 永远也不会顺从我父亲的意旨，可是我已打定主意决不做任何违背他的事，或者不得他的同意 就采取任何重大步骤。我把这坚定不移的心意告诉了您，希望您就对那桩命中（也许）已经注 定不能实现的事，断了念吧。为您自己着想，也非如此不可。我希望这样一来，您就可以与奥 尔华绥先生和解了；果能如此，我要求您务必这样做。有些事使我很感激一一更感激的是您的 一番好意。将来，命运也许会对咱们俩比当前更仁慈些。请相信您将在我心中永远占据应有的 位置。
您的恭顺而感激的仆人， 苏菲亚•魏斯顿
我要求您此后不再写信给我，至少目前勿再写。请您收下这个［8］。我已用不着它，但我知 道您却需要它一一我认为您只应感激令您拾到它的命运。
这封信，一个刚学会字母的孩子念起来花的时间也要比琼斯少一些。 读的时候，琼斯真是忧喜交集，他的心情就像一个心地善良的人在读着亡 友的遗嘱一一正当他手头拮据的时候，死者给他留下一大笔财产，自是更 受欢迎。大体说来，琼斯是喜多于忧；读者甚至会奇怪他还有什么可忧的
呢？这是因为读者并没有像可怜的琼斯那样深深堕入情网，而恋爱这种症 候虽然在某些情况下类似肺病（有时候肺病也正是它引起的），在另外一 些情况下，又与肺病恰好相反，尤其在这一点上：它从不抱奢望，或者从 有利的方面去理解任何迹象。
有一件事使他完全满意，那就是他所爱的人已经重获自由，如今住在 姑妈家里，至少会受到像样子的对待。另一件使他宽慰的事是她答应永远 不嫁旁人。不管他把自己的爱情想得多么毫无私心，也不管他在信里做了 多么豪迈的表示，然而要是他听到苏菲亚跟旁人结了婚（即使是一桩肯定 会使她无限幸福的最美满的婚姻），我相信不会有比这更使他痛苦的消息 了。那种完全脱离肉体、纯粹寄托在精神上的柏拉图式的高雅爱情是只有 女性才具备的禀赋。我听到许多女人表示（想必都是诚心诚意的），她们 甘愿把自己所爱的人让给情敌，只要这种退让对那位情人现世的利益确实 是必要的。因此，我断定人间的确有这种爱情，尽管我不敢说曾见过一个 例子。
琼斯先生花了三个钟头读那封信，并且吻它。最后，想到苏菲亚总算 是重获自由，他感到十分高兴，因而同意履行早先答应过的一件事：陪密 勒太太和她的小女儿到戏院去看戏，并且让巴特里奇先生也一道前往。许 多人装作很懂得欣赏幽默，其实，琼斯倒真有这种兴味。他料到会从巴特 里奇口中听见一些趣味横生的妙论，一种发自质朴的天性，因而也就是既 没经过艺术加工，也没被艺术所败坏的幽默。
于是，琼斯先生、密勒太太、她的小女儿和巴特里奇就在顶层楼座的 第一排坐下了。巴特里奇立刻说，他生平从没坐过这么好的位子。当音乐 刚一奏起来的时候，他说："真了不起！这么多提琴手一齐拉，居然谁也没 走调儿。”看到剧院的伙计在点蜡烛，他大声对密勒太太嚷道：“太太， 瞧，瞧，那人不是和祷文书末尾，’火药阴谋'祷文前面那幅插图凹里的家伙 一模一样吗？ ”等那人把所有的蜡烛都点起来之后，巴特里奇又忍不住叹了 口气说："这儿一晚上点的蜡烛，够一个穷苦、老实人家点一年的了。”
演的是《丹麦王子哈姆莱特》。戏刚一开始，巴特里奇就聚精会神地 看着；在鬼魂出场以前，他一声也没吭。看到鬼魂，他问琼斯说："那个穿 着奇装异服的是啥人？我好像在一张画里见到过。他穿的总不是盔甲 吧？ ”琼斯回答说："那是个鬼。”巴特里奇笑了笑说："先生，您别哄我 啦。尽管我一辈子还不曾真的见过鬼，但如果见到的话，我准可以认出它
来的。不，不，先生，鬼不会穿那种衣裳。"巴特里奇这种谬见惹得邻座都 哄然大笑。琼斯说台上出现的是鬼，他不肯相信，可是迦里克M先生的表演 却使他相信了。巴特里奇忽然吓得浑身发抖，双膝不住地磕碰。琼斯问他 怎么了，是不是害怕台上那个穿甲戴盔的。巴特里奇说："哎呀，我现在才 看出它果然像您所说的是个鬼。我什么也不怕，因为我晓得这只是在演 戏。而且，即使它真是个鬼，离这么远，又有这么多人，它也不能伤害 我。要是我害怕的话，那么害怕的也决不止我一个人。""哦，那么你以为 除了你自己以外，还有谁像你那么胆小？”琼斯大声问道。"您说我胆小就 说去吧。台上的那个小个子要是不害怕的话，那我一辈子就不曾见过一个 害怕的人了。喂，喂，一道去吧。嗯，就去好了。唉，看谁是傻瓜！真要 跟着去吗？啊，求上帝怜悯这份鲁莽吧！……无论发生什么事，都是活 该……跟你走？我宁可跟魔鬼也不跟你走。哦，也许这个就是魔鬼……因 为大家说魔鬼想变什么就变什么。……啊，他又出来啦……别再跟他走 啦！啊，你已经跟他走得够远的了一一就是把国王的疆土全给我，我也不 会走那么远的。”琼斯刚要开口，巴特里奇又嚷道："嘘，嘘！亲爱的先 生，难道您没听见他在说话吗？”台上那个鬼魂讲话的当儿，巴特里奇一直 张大着嘴，眼睛一边盯着鬼魂，一边盯着哈姆莱特一一哈姆莱特心里起伏 着的种种情感也在他心里起伏着。
这一场戏演完之后，琼斯说："喂，巴特里奇，你比我估量的还要有意 思。我决没料到你这么欢喜看这出戏。""先生，"巴特里奇说，"您要是不 怕魔鬼，那我可没法子。尽管我晓得鬼并没有什么，可是看见这种东西给 吓一跳却是很自然的事；吓我的并不是鬼，我当然晓得那不过是个普通人 穿上件奇怪的衣服装扮的，可是我一看到那小个子吓得哆里哆嗦，我才跟 着怕起来。皿巴特里奇，”琼斯大声说，"那么你以为他真的害怕了 吗不，先生，"巴特里奇说，"后来您自己没理会到吗：当他看出那个 鬼就是他的老子，并且听到他是怎样在花园里被害死的时候，他逐渐不害 怕了，悲哀却使他说不出话来。我要是处在他那情景，我也会那样的。 听，哎呀，那是什么声音哟！他又出来啦……哦，尽管我晓得并没什么， 可我还是高兴自己没坐在下面一一跟那些人坐在一起。"然后，他又把目光 移到哈姆莱特身上："喂，喂，把你的剑拔出来！但是碰上了鬼，剑又有什 么用呢！ ”
在第二幕里，巴特里奇没怎么发议论，只不过大为称赞演员服装的华 丽，还不禁就国王的神色说了些话。"人的外貌多么能欺骗人呀！”他 说，"Nulla fides fronti^这句话确实不假。光看国王那张脸，谁会料到他 行过凶呢！"说完之后，他问鬼跑到哪儿去了。琼斯故意吓唬他一下，就只 含含糊糊地说：过一会儿也许火光一闪还会见到的。
于是，巴特里奇就提心吊胆地等候着。当鬼魂再一次出现的时候，巴 特里奇就大声嚷道："先生，它又出来啦。这会儿您说说看，现在他究竟怕 是不怕？您认为我害怕，他跟我一样害怕，谁也免不了有点害怕的。就是 把整个世界给了我，我也不愿处在他一一他叫什么名字来着？一一哈姆莱 特乡绅的那种倒霉的境地。哎呀！鬼魂哪儿去啦？我好像看见它沉到地下 去了，跟我是个活人一样地真切。皿可不是嘛，你没看错，”琼斯 说。"咳，咳，”巴特里奇嚷道，"我晓得这不过是出戏，而且，要是真有点 什么的话，密勒太太也不会那么笑。至于您呢，先生，即使魔鬼亲自登 场，您也不会害怕的。瞧，瞧，难怪你皿这么激动，把那个狠毒的贱人给摇 碎了吧，她要是我的生身之母，我也会那么着的。真的，她既然干了这样 的坏事，对她就谈不上什么孝道了……喂，快滚开吧，看到你我就恶心。”
直到哈姆莱特派人在国王面前演出那个戏中戏为止，我们这位剧评家 没怎么做声。最初，他没看懂这一幕，经过琼斯的解释他才明白的。他一 领会到戏的要旨，立刻就表示感谢上帝，亏得他自己没犯过凶杀罪。然后 他掉过身子来问密勒太太觉不觉得那个国王心里慌张了，尽管他是个好演 员，竭力掩饰住自己的慌张。巴特里奇还说："哼，哪怕给我比那个坏人还 高得多的位子，我也不要欠下那么多孽债。难怪他逃跑了。就由于你，我 也决不再相信貌似老实的人了。”
接着，掘墓那一场也引起了巴特里奇的注意。看到台上丢着那么多骷 髅，他感到很惊愕。琼斯告诉他说，那是城里最著名的坟场。"难怪这地方 闹鬼啦，"巴特里奇嚷道，"可是我一辈子还没见过这么蹩脚的掘墓人。以 前我在教堂里当执事的时候有个掘墓的；台上这个人掘一座墓的工夫他可 以掘三座。看来这汉子好像是初次摸铁锹。喂，喂，你唱吧。你一定宁愿 唱唱歌也不愿干活。”当他看到哈姆莱特拾起一个骷髅的时候，他就嚷 道："嗬，有些人胆子真大得出奇！我是无论如何也不肯碰碰死人的什么 的 刚才我觉得他也挺怕鬼的呀。Nemo omnibus horis sapit.0”
此后，就没什么可记的了。戏演完之后，琼斯问巴特里奇他最喜欢哪 个演员。他略带愠色说："没疑问，当然是国王喽。皿真的，巴特里奇先 生，"密勒太太说，"你这个看法可跟大家不一样。他们都一致认为扮哈姆 莱特的是舞台上从没见过的最好的演员。""他会是最好的演员？"巴特里奇 鄙夷地讥笑说，"我演起来也能跟他一样好。要是见到了鬼，我一定也会像 他那样表情，那样动作。至于您所说的母子交谈的那一场，您告诉我哈姆 莱特演得非常出色，哼，那算什么！任何人，我的意思是说，任何正派 人，遇到那样的娘，一定都会那么做的。我晓得您只不过是跟我开玩笑。 太太，尽管我没在伦敦看过戏，可是我在乡下看过。我中意的是国王。他 吐字清清楚楚，而且声音比哈姆莱特要大上一倍一一谁都可以看出他是个 出色的演员。”
密勒太太正和巴特里奇这样攀谈的时候，一位女客向琼斯先生走来， 他马上认出是费兹帕特利太太。她说她从楼座的对面望到了他，抓这个机 会同他谈一谈，想告诉他一些话，可能对他大有用处。然后就把住址留给 他，约他第二天早晨去和她相会一一接着她寻思了一下，又改作下午。琼 斯答应一定准时去拜候。
这次看戏就这样结束了。巴特里奇不但叫琼斯和密勒太太大为开心， 也叫邻座的观众感到莫大的兴味。他们对巴特里奇的议论比对台上的表演 还更留意。
因为怕鬼，巴特里奇一夜都不敢入睡；那以后，仍由于怕鬼，许多晚 上他总要先出上两三个钟头的汗才睡得着，而且还吓醒好几次，大声嚷 道："鬼又来啦，老天发发慈悲吧！ ”

第六章
我们不得不回过头来倒叙一件过去的事
即使是最贤明的父母，也不可能做到对自己亲生的儿女一点不存偏心 ――哪怕儿女并没有什么出色的地方值得父母这样钟爱。那么如果儿女确 是出类拔萃的，那就更难责怪父母的偏爱了。
我既然把这部历史中的一切人物都看作自己的儿女，我就必须承认我 在苏菲亚身上也有着这种偏爱。基于苏菲亚品格非凡，希望读者也容许我 这种偏爱。
对这位女主人公怀有这样深挚的感情，就使我很不愿意和她分别稍 久。因此，我现在以急迫的心情想了解一下这位可爱的人儿自从离开她父 亲以后遭遇到些什么。不过，在这之前，我得先到布利非先生那里作一次 简短的访问。
魏斯顿先生因为女儿的消息来得很突然，一时手忙脚乱，动身的时候 只顾去找自己的女儿，完全没想到通知布利非一声苏菲亚已经有了下落。 可是没走出多远他就想起来了，所以见到头一家客栈就停下来，派人给布 利非捎去一封信，告诉他已经找到了苏菲亚，并要他也赶来京城，说已决 定立刻把女儿嫁给他。
既然布利非对苏菲亚所怀的是那么一种强烈的爱情：除非捞不到她的 财产或有什么类似的情况，决不会使他冷淡下来；所以他对结这门亲事的 意向并未因苏菲亚的出逃而有所动摇，尽管他不得不承认自己正是造成她 出逃的原因。因此，他马上欣然接受了这个建议。老实说，布利非现在打 算把这位小姐娶到手的动机，除满足他的贪心之外，还为了满足另外一种 强烈情绪一一那就是仇恨。他认为仇恨也好，爱情也好，都同样可以借着 这场婚姻得到满足。这种看法似乎已由许多例子所证实。其实，倘若我们 根据已婚男女一般的关系来看，就很容易断定世上大部分夫妇所以会结成 除了心而外一切都结合的婚姻，都只是为了满足前一种感情一一仇恨。
不过布利非还面临着一道难关，这来自奥尔华绥先生。苏菲亚一逃 走，那位好心人就发现原来她是那样憎恶自己的外甥（因为出逃这件事以 及造成她出逃的原因都瞒不住奥尔华绥先生）。他开始深深担心自己是上 了当，以致把事情做过了头。奥尔华绥先生不赞成有些做父母的见解，认 为在婚姻问题上考虑子女的愿望，就像出门旅行的时候征求一下仆人的意
见一样无关紧要；他们之所以往往不肯完全使用压力，只是碍于法律或者 至少是出于顾全面子。奥尔华绥先生恰恰相反，他把婚姻这件事看得极为 神圣，所以他认为事先一定要很慎重，以便保持婚姻的神圣，让它受不到 亵渎。于是，他非常明智地断定要做到这一点，男女之间事先必须具备感 情的基础。
布利非起了许多誓，说他自己也上了当一一这话又和魏斯顿一再表示 的不谋而合，所以很快就使他舅父息怒了。然而如今要说服奥尔华绥同意 他再去求婚，显然就不那么容易了，一个进取心稍差的人一定会望而生 畏。然而这位少爷非常清楚自己的才能，凡属狡计，他认为自己都不难得 手。
于是，他就向他舅父表白了一番自己对苏菲亚的爱情有多么深厚，他 希望凭着一股锲而不舍的精神，消除那位小姐对他的憎恶。在这件涉及他 毕生安宁的婚姻大事上，他央求奥尔华绥先生至少准许他试尽一切可能成 功的途径。他还说，除了最温和的办法之外，上帝决不容许他去考虑旁的 途径来贯彻自己的意志。"而且，舅父，"他说，"要是这些办法全失败了， 那时您也来得及（时间从容得很）反对我再进行这件事。"他竭力说魏斯顿 先生对这门亲事有多么热心，最后，还一再提起琼斯的名字，把所发生的 事完全归咎于琼斯，说保全这位高贵小姐，不让琼斯得到她，甚至还是一 件善行呢！
所有这些论点都得到了屠瓦孔的附和，只不过屠瓦孔比布利非先生更 强调父母对子女的权威。他把布利非先生所要采取的步骤说成是出于一个 基督教徒的动机。还说："虽然这位好心肠的少爷最后才提到善行，我相信 那是他的第一个、也是最主要的考虑。”
要是斯奎尔在座的话，他很可能也会随声附和，只是用不同的调子罢 了；他很可能从这件事上看出不少道德的适宜性来。不过他此刻到巴思疗 养去了。
奥尔华绥终于勉强同意了他外甥的请求。他说他要亲自陪布利非去伦 敦，好让他外甥运用一切光明正大的办法来争取小姐的好感。"不过我要先 说明白，"奥尔华绥说，"我决不会同意你使用任何强暴手段来逼婚。如果 她不是自愿嫁给你，你就永远也不能娶她。”
由于疼爱外甥，奥尔华绥的大智就这样被布利非的小聪明征服了。最 清醒的头脑往往也正是这样败于最柔软的心肠。
布利非出乎意料地得到了舅父的默许。可是这件事一天没办成，他总 是不罢休的。既然奥尔华绥先生眼下在乡下没什么脱不开身的事务，而男 人出门又不需怎么准备，他们第二天就上了路；正当琼斯先生在戏院里听 巴特里奇大发议论感到开心的那个晚上，他们就来到了京城。
第二天早晨，布利非先生就去拜望魏斯顿先生，受到极其殷勤而且热 烈的招待。他从魏斯顿那里得到了一切可能（也许超过了可能）的保证： 说不久他就一定可以享受苏菲亚所能给予他的幸福。而且这位乡绅几乎是 逆着布利非的心愿，硬把他拉到苏菲亚的姑妈跟前，然后才放他回去见他 舅父。
第七章
魏斯顿先生偕布利非先生去拜望他的妹妹
魏斯顿女士正为她的侄女讲说谨慎之道和婚姻策略问题时，她的哥哥 和布利非不遵循访客的礼数就闯了进来。苏菲亚一望到布利非，立刻面色 苍白，一切官能几乎全丧失了作用。可是她姑妈脸上反而涨红了，各种官 能也全听她使唤。于是，她朝乡绅鼓起了舌簧。
"哥哥，"她说，"你这么孟浪真叫人吃惊。难道永远也不学学讲礼貌？ 你怎么还是把别人的房间都当作你自己的，或是你的佃户的？你以为不经 -定的礼仪，甚至不需要通报一声就可以随便闯进上流妇女的内室 吗？皿干吗这样大惊小怪的，"乡绅说，"外人还以为我捉到你……""先 生，请你别在这儿说野话！"她说，"瞧，你把我可怜的侄女吓得都支持不 住了一一进去吧，亲爱的，好好养养神，我看你很需要休息。"苏菲亚当然 是求之不得，赶紧就遵命走开了。
"妹妹，你可真是发疯了，"乡绅嚷道，"我把布利非先生带来向她求 婚，你却硬把她打发走了。”
"哥哥，"她说，"你干的简直比发疯还要糟糕，因为你明明晓得这件事 情目前的局势……我相信布利非先生不会见怪的，他晓得这么不愉快的会 晤应该由谁来负责。至于我自己，我总是非常高兴见到布利非先生的。然 而要不是你硬逼着他，以他那样有见识的人，决不会进行得这么孟浪的。”
布利非哈了哈腰，张口结舌，像个傻瓜。魏斯顿没容他想好切合时机 的措辞就回答说："好吧，好吧，是我的错，就照你说的，错的永远是我， 这是一定的。可是你总得把姑娘叫回来啊，要不就让布利非先生到她那儿 去，他就是为这件事情来的，别耽搁他的时间呀。”
"哥哥，"魏斯顿女士嚷道，"经过刚才发生的事，我相信知情达理的布 利非先生决不会还想今天早晨来见我的侄女。女人家气质娇嫩，我们心绪 要是受到波动，一时半刻是平静不下来的。如果事先你让布利非先生派人 向我侄女问候一下，要求她当天下午接见，我或许能劝她答应下来。可是 现在我向她提这件事是没用的。”
"真对不起，"布利非大声说，"魏斯顿先生对我这番盛意真是太可感 了，没料到会造成……""真的，先生，"她插嘴说，"您用不着道歉。我哥 哥那性子我们全知道。”
"我不管谁知道不知道我怎么样，"乡绅说，"但是他哪天再来会她呢？ 你要晓得，人家是特地为这件事情来的一一奥尔华绥也是特地来办这件事 的。""哥哥，"她说，"布利非先生有什么要我转达我侄女的，我一定都替 他办到。我想，在给予恰当的答复方面，她也不会乏人指导。我相信她不 会拒绝在适当的时候来接见布利非先生的。皿拒绝她妈的鬼！"乡绅回答 说，"妈的，以为我们还不晓得……我用不着说，但是有些人比谁都聪明。 我要是做得了主的话，她上次就根本跑不掉；如今，我又时时刻刻担心她 再溜走。尽管有的人把我看作个大傻瓜，我却很清楚她恨……""算了吧， 哥哥，"魏斯顿女士说，"我不愿听人家说我侄女的坏话。这关系到我们家 族的体面。她是我们家的荣誉。她以后也会是我们家的荣誉，这一点我敢 担保。我要拿我的全部名誉来保证她的品行。哥哥，下午我想见见你，我 要告诉你一件很要紧的事。眼下，只好请你和布利非先生原谅，我得赶快 去换衣服。”"那么你指定个时间吧，”乡绅说。"我不能指定什么时间，"她 说，"告诉你，我下午要会会你嘛。""这可叫我怎么办哪，"乡绅掉过身来 朝布利非嚷道，"我拗不过她，就像小猎犬拗不过一只老母兔一样。也许下 午她脾气会好一些。""先生，”布利非回答说，"看来我注定是要倒霉的， 但是我一定永远感激您这番盛意。”接着，他毕恭毕敬地向魏斯顿女士告 辞，她照样还了礼。然后，他们就走了。一路上乡绅自己喃喃赌咒说，下 午非让布利非见到苏菲亚不可。
如果魏斯顿先生对这次会见不怎么高兴，布利非就更加扫兴了。乡绅 认为他妹妹所以会那样，只不过是因为她心绪不佳，并且怪他们登门拜望 前，礼貌有欠周到。可是布利非把事情看得更深一些。从苏菲亚的姑妈顺 口说出的两三句话里，他怀疑其中大有文章。老实说，从下章里我将向读 者透露的几桩事情来看，他的怀疑还是颇有道理的。
第八章
贝拉斯顿夫人计毁琼斯
爱情在费拉玛勋爵的心里深深地扎下了根，就是凭魏斯顿先生那双粗 鲁的手也拔它不出。在激怒中，他就派了艾格连大尉那么一个任务，那位 大尉执行的时候又远远超出原来的委托一一如果勋爵见到贝拉斯顿夫人以 后（这是在他受到冒犯的那天下午）能找到大尉的话，那个任务本来不必 执行了。可是那位大尉干得很勤快。他四处打听，天色很晚才探知乡绅的 寓所。于是，他就在一家酒馆里坐到通宵，以便早晨准能会到乡绅。这么 一来，他就没能收到勋爵送到他寓所里去的那个撤销委托的通知。
刚才说过，在勋爵对苏菲亚强行无礼未遂的次日下午，勋爵去拜望了 贝拉斯顿夫人一趟，夫人把乡绅的性格讲了个仔细，听完之后，勋爵明白 看出自己去计较这种人所说的话真是太荒唐了一一尤其他还在乡绅的女儿 身上怀着光明正大的念头。于是，他就推心置腹地把他对苏菲亚如何一往 情深的话全告诉了贝拉斯顿夫人。夫人立刻答应帮他的忙，给他鼓勤说， 家族里的长辈一定都会热烈赞成这件事的；要是她父亲没喝醉，并且让他 晓得这是多么好的一门亲事，他也一定会赞成的。她说唯一可能捣乱的还 是她以前提过的那个小伙子，尽管他是个叫花子、流浪汉，不晓得他从哪 里混到一身看得过去的衣服，竟也冒充起绅士来了。"为了保护我这个外甥 女，”她说，"我打听了这家伙的情况。如今，幸喜已找到他的住址。”说 完，她就把那地址告诉了勋爵。"大人，"她又说，"这小伙子出身卑贱，您 犯不着亲自惩治他。您看能不能想办法把他抓去当兵，送到一只舰上去。 这样做既不犯法，于良心也无愧。因为尽管那小伙子穿得蛮漂亮，其实只 是个流浪汉，跟街上任何一个流浪汉一样，理应抓去当水兵的。至于良心 方面，保全一位小姐不至于遭到毁灭总该是件功德吧。说到那个家伙本 人，除非他把我的外甥女弄到手（天哪，但愿不会这样），不然的话，把 他抓去当兵可能还免得他上绞刑架一一说不定他可以靠正当的办法发迹 呢。”
费拉玛勋爵由衷地感谢夫人在这件事情上帮的忙，这事的成败关系到 他一生的幸福。他说，眼下看不出这个抓壮丁的计划有什么不妥当的地 方，他一定设法照办。然后，他非常恳切地请求夫人抬举他，立刻替他向 女方家里提亲。他说要提供一份空白委任书，并表示他的全部财产都可以
听任女方处置。他又说了许多对苏菲亚着迷和喜爱的话之后，就告辞而 去。临走，夫人又再三叮嘱一定要提防琼斯，尽快把他弄到妥当地方，叫 他再也不能试图毁掉小姐。
魏斯顿女士一回到寓所，立刻就派人拿着她的名片去问候贝拉斯顿夫 人。夫人一接到名片，就像个情人那么迫不及待地跑去看她这位表妹。这 个意想不到的大好机会使她高兴非常，这样一来她就可以向一位通情理、 谙世故的女人提亲，不必再去同那个她尊为霍屯督族也］的乡绅去打交道了 ――尽管她并不认为乡绅会一口回绝。
这两位妇女会了面，交换了几句客套之后，就谈起正事来了，而且几 乎一谈就成，因为魏斯顿女士刚一听到费拉玛勋爵的名字，就欢喜得脸蛋 儿都发亮了。再听说这位贵族对她侄女这么一往情深，求婚求得这么诚 恳，条件又这么优厚，她就毫不含糊地表示了赞成。
后来话题转到琼斯身上来了。两位表姐妹异口同声地痛惜苏菲亚爱上 那个小伙子是一件不幸的事，魏斯顿女士还认为这件糊涂事所以发生完全 怪她哥哥处理不当。不过最后她说，她完全相信自己的侄女的见识，"尽管 我侄女不肯为布利非放弃她自己所爱的人，"她说，"可要是这么一位既带 给她爵位，又带给她一大片产业的贵族，我相信她一定可以接受劝导，牺 牲区区那点心愿的。"随后，她又说："替苏菲说句公道话，布利非这家伙 真是面目可憎；所有的乡村绅士都是一个样。这种人除去家当之外，别无 可取之处。”
"啊，"贝拉斯顿夫人说，"这就难怪外甥女不肯答应这门亲事喽。我晓 得这个琼斯是个很讨人欢喜的小伙子，人家都说，他对妇女有一种特殊的 魅力。您猜怎么着，魏斯顿女士，说起来一定笑坏了人。我自己笑得简直 说不出话来了。您能相信吗？这家伙居然厚着脸皮追起我来了。您要是不 信的话，这是他的亲笔信，总足以证明了吧。"然后，她就把琼斯向她求婚 的那封信递给这位表姐一一这封信已见本书第十五卷，读者有兴趣可以再 参阅一下。
"这我可真没料到！"魏斯顿女士说，"可真是无耻到极点啦。蒙您恩 准，这封信我说不定还可以利用一下呢。""您尽管用吧，"贝拉斯顿夫人大 声说，"随您怎么使用都成。可是除了魏斯顿小姐以外，希望不要给旁的人 看，给她看也要碰上时机。""那么您是怎么对待那家伙的呢？”魏斯顿女士 问道。"没有当作一个丈夫，"夫人说。"亲爱的，请相信我并没嫁给他。您
知道，这种滋味儿我是尝过一回的。对任何懂事的女人来说，一回就足够 啦。”
贝拉斯顿夫人估计这封信必然会使琼斯在苏菲亚心上的地位一落千 丈。她所以敢于把它拿出来，一则因为她认为琼斯立刻就可以给抓走，二 则是由于她拿得稳昂诺尔一定会出头作证一一她曾探了一下昂诺尔的口 气，相信不论要昂诺尔给证明什么，她都肯的。
不过读者也许会感到奇怪，既然贝拉斯顿夫人心里那么恨苏菲亚，她 为什么这么热心替苏菲亚张罗这门对那位小姐十分有利的亲事呢？凡是有 此感的读者，请仔细翻一下"人性"这本大书，他会在差不多最后一页上看 到用依稀可辨的字迹写着：女人，不管她们的母亲、姑妈和姨妈在婚姻问 题上会做出多么不合理的事情来，实际上却认为在爱情上不能如愿以偿是 最大的不幸，她们料想没有比这方面的失望更能引起她们仇恨的了。读者 还会发现离这段话不远的地方写着：一个女人只要曾经满意地占有过某个 男人，为了不让旁的女人沾光，她什么狠毒手段都使得出来。
倘若这些解释不能满足读者，我只能坦率承认，除此之外我看不出贝 拉斯顿夫人还能有什么旁的动机；除非她是受了费拉玛勋爵的贿赂，而我 认为这种猜度是毫无根据的。
魏斯顿女士打算说给苏菲亚听的，就是这件事。当她刚刚谈起爱情的 愚蠢以及合法卖淫有多么明智的时候，她哥哥和布利非陡然间闯进来了， 因此，她才对布利非那么冷淡。尽管乡绅照例没把冷淡的原因弄清楚，可 是她的话却使布利非（他比乡绅要狡猾多了）猜到了真相。
第九章
琼斯走访费兹帕特利太太
读者也许乐意同作者一道回到琼斯先生身边。他在约定的时间去拜望 费兹帕特利太太。但是在叙述他们现在所进行的谈话之前，也许照我们往 常的办法，应该先掉转过来交代一下这位太太何以大大改变了态度：以前 为了避免跟琼斯先生往来而搬了家，如今却拼命想跟他会会面。
这里，我们只消讲一讲头一天发生的事就行了。那天，费兹帕特利太 太从贝拉斯顿夫人那里听到魏斯顿先生已经来到京城，她就到乡绅在皮卡 迪利的寓所去请安，可是却挨了他一顿臭骂，粗野到没法在这里重述，甚 至恫吓要一脚把她踢出门去。费兹帕特利太太认识她姑妈的一个老用人， 这人把她从皮卡迪利领到她姑妈家里。魏斯顿女士对她表面上虽然客气 些，但并不比乡绅友善，或者老实说，是另一种方式的粗暴无礼。一句 话，拜访了这两处亲戚之后，她明白看出不但这次和解的想法已成泡影， 而且此后也不必再存这种念头。从此，她就时刻想着要报仇雪恨。她正怀 着这种情绪的时候，在戏院里遇到了琼斯，她觉得报仇的时机好像到了。
读者想必记得费兹帕特利太太向苏菲亚叙述自己的经历时，提到魏斯 顿女士在巴思曾经一度喜欢过费兹帕特利先生，费兹帕特利太太认为她姑 妈是由于自己才失恋的，所以后来才对侄女那么恨之入骨。因此，她认为 琼斯先生要是去追求她姑妈，一定也会像费兹帕特利先生那样容易成功。 琼斯先生长得显然比她丈夫漂亮，而且她姑妈比那时又长了几岁，这对她 的意图更是有益无损一一这个想法究竟有几分道理，我可不知道。
因此，琼斯一到，她就先表白自己愿意替他效劳，因为她坚决相信这 样做，苏菲亚就会深深领她的情。她又为上回的爽约道了歉，并且告诉琼 斯先生眼下苏菲亚是在谁的监管之下，她以为他还不晓得哪。她直截了当 地向琼斯提出自己的计策，劝他向那位老小姐表示爱情，以便获得接近苏 菲亚的机会；同时还告诉琼斯当初费兹帕特利先生用的正是这套策略。
琼斯先生对这位太太的一番美意，表示非常感谢；而且她提出的这条 计策，也说明她对自己的关怀。但是他对这么做能不能成功，表示怀疑， 因为魏斯顿女士已经晓得他爱上了她的侄女，这跟费兹帕特利先生的情形 就不一样；何况苏菲亚恐怕决不会赞成他使用这种欺诈手段，一方面，由
于她对一切虚伪行为都是憎恶的，同时也出于她自己公开表明的对姑妈应 尽的义务。
费兹帕特利太太听了颇不痛快。如果琼斯先生这种表示还算不上失言 的话，至少也有些失礼；因为在这对堂姐妹之间，他褒奖了苏菲亚，无形 中就贬低了费兹帕特利太太。如果琼斯先生不是心里太喜欢赞美苏菲亚， 他本来会考虑得更周到一些的。
"老实说，先生，"她带些火气说，"我认为世上再没有用求爱来诳一个 老女人更容易的事了，尤其要是她天性喜欢这种风流事儿的话。尽管她是 我的姑姑，我也不得不承认没人比她更想找男人的了。难道您不能装作既 然她的侄女已经许配给布利非了，您在绝望中才把心移到她身上？至于我 的堂妹苏菲亚，我决不认为她那么蠢，会计较这种事情，或者会以为惩治 —下这种老妖精有什么害处，她们闹的悲喜剧已给家属带来不少灾难了。 可惜法律不能制裁这种行径。对于玩这套骗局我没什么顾忌，如果我说苏 菲亚也不见得比我更憎恶一切真正的虚伪，希望我堂妹也不要见怪。对这 位姑姑，我不想装出多么孝敬，她也一点都不配。不过，先生，我已经给 您出过主意了，如果您不采纳，我只能认为您没有我想的那么聪明。咱们 话就说到这儿吧。”
琼斯清清楚楚地看出自己所犯的过错，竭力想矫正一下。然而他只能 吞吞吐吐、结结巴巴地说些不摸头脑和自相矛盾的话。老实说，一次错 了，最妥当还是安心接受这次错误的后果；一旦企图去矫正，往往会错上 加错，以致难以自拔。在当前这个场合，很少人能像费兹帕特利太太那么 好脾气。她对琼斯笑了笑说："您用不着再解释什么了。我可以轻易原谅一 个真正的情人，不论他对意中人这样痴情会有什么后果。”
然后，她又提出那个建议，凡是她想得出的理由她全讲了，热切地劝 琼斯采纳。她对她姑妈恨透了，只有想法叫她丢丢丑才能令她解恨；而且 正像个道地的女人，她看不出这样称心的一个计策会遇到什么障碍。
然而琼斯无论如何也不肯干这件事，而且这也丝毫没有成功的可能。 他不难看出费兹帕特利太太这么拼命向他献计是别有用心的。他说他并不 否认自己是深深地爱着苏菲亚，但是他也十分明白两个人境遇的悬殊，从 来也不敢奢望，她那样圣洁的一位小姐会肯于屈身嫁给他这样一个一无足 取的人，而且他还说，他也不忍心希望她会这样做。最后他还说了几句豪 迈的话，目前我们就无暇去叙述了。
在某些上流女人（这里我不敢一概而论）心目中占主导地位的是个我 字，谈什么她们都离不开自己。她们一心一意追求虚荣，所以听到什么赞 美，总要掠夺过来；尽管是旁人的财产，她们也攫为己有。跟这种女人在 一起，只要一说起旁的女人什么好话，必然立刻就被她们扯到自己身上。 而且她们往往把好话安到自己身上以后，还要锦上添花。譬如，要是旁的 女人由于美貌、机智、文雅以及性情柔和而应备受称赞，那么这些优点我 统统具备，并且还大大超过她们，我又该受到怎样的称赞呢？
一个男人要是在这种女人面前称赞其他女人，他往往会使听者对他发 生好感。当这个男人对自己所爱的人表示出一腔热烈而崇高的感情时，那 女人会想：对一个远远不如我的女人他尚且这么钟情，他爱的要是我，那 该有多么称心啊。尽管这类事情好像很离奇，但除去费兹帕特利太太之 外，我还见过不少例子。当前，费兹帕特利太太就真是这样：她开始对琼 斯先生发生了某种感情，对这种感情，她很快就意识到了，不像过去可怜 的苏菲亚那么迟缓。
老实说，不论男性还是女性，完美无瑕的容貌所具有的力量比一般人 想的更加不可抗拒。尽管我们当中有些人满足于姿色平常的伴侣，并且人 云亦云地说着（就像小孩子背诵一些他根本不明含意的东西）外在的美不 足取，实质的美才有价值；可是我总看到这种实质的美在天姿国色跟前， 其光芒就像星星见了初升的太阳。
琼斯讲的话很大一部分只应出自奥容达特M之口，讲完之后，费兹帕特 利太太就长叹了一声，把凝视了琼斯好半天的一双眼睛移开，望着地大声 说："琼斯先生，我同情您。但是您把这样一片深情厚意白白糟蹋在不懂得 领会的人身上了，真是可惜。琼斯先生，我总比您了解我的堂妹。我不得 不说，一个女人要是对您这样的情意，对您这样的人品，竟然不知道酬 答，这二者她全不配享受。”
"太太，"琼斯说，"您的意思决不会是……""我的意思！"费兹帕特利 太太大声说道，"我也说不清我是什么意思。我想在真正的爱情里面必有一 种使人着迷的东西。能在男人身上发现这种东西的女人很少，即使发现 了，懂得去珍爱的女人就更少了。我从来也没听人讲过像您讲的那种真正 高贵的话，我也说不出为什么，反正我没法儿不相信您。一个女人要是不 知重视您这种美德，那她真是最可鄙了。”
费兹帕特利太太说这番话时候的神情眼色引起了琼斯某种怀疑，究竟 他怀疑些什么，我们就不必对读者挑明了。总之，琼斯并没去理会她上面 那段话，只说："太太，恐怕我太打搅您了。"然后就表示要告辞而去。
"先生，一点也没有，"费兹帕特利太太回答说，"琼斯先生，我真的可 怜您，一点也不假。您要是走的话，那么请您考虑一下我给您出的那条计 策，我相信您会赞同的。咱们尽早再会会吧……明天早晨怎么样？或者至 少不出明天吧。我明天一天都不出门。”
琼斯又一再道了谢，然后就毕恭毕敬地告别了。临走的时候，费兹帕 特利太太不免还对他飞了个眼色；如果琼斯还不了解她的含义，那他对眼 睛的语言必然是一窍不通了。实际上，这样一来倒使琼斯下定决心不再来 见她了，因为尽管他在本书中前此失过足，眼下他一心一意都在苏菲亚身 上，我相信世上任凭哪个女人也不能再引诱他干负心的勾当了。
命运总也不站在琼斯这一边。如今，琼斯打定主意不再受它摆布了， 命运就决计利用这个机会来尽情捉弄他，一个悲剧性的事件就产生了。我 们将用哀伤的笔调来叙述。
第十章
前次拜访的结果
费兹帕特利先生从魏斯顿女士那里接到前边提过的那封信，从而得知 他妻子隐居的地方，就立刻回到巴思，次日又动身到伦敦来。
作者已经一再告诉过读者，这位先生很好吃醋。大家一定还记得当他 在厄普顿发现琼斯和沃特尔太太同在一间房里的时候，他就对琼斯起过疑 心。尽管后来有足够的理由可以消除他的猜忌，可是如今读到他妻子在信 中称道琼斯先生的品貌如何好，使他想起当时她也住在同一家客栈里。这 样，他那生来本就不大清楚的头脑，更是被搅得乱七八糟了，于是就产生 了莎士比亚在他的悲剧《奥瑟罗》里提到的那个绿眼的妖精8。
正当他在街上打听他妻子的住处，经人指点来到门口的时候，不幸琼 斯先生刚好从那里面走出来。
费兹帕特利并没立刻认出琼斯来。可是瞥见一个衣冠楚楚的年轻人从 他妻子的住处出来，他就径直走过去，问他到里面干什么去的。他说："你 一定到里面去过了，因为我眼睁睁看到你走出来的。”
琼斯很谦逊地说，他到里面去会一位太太。费兹帕特利听了问道："你 找那位太太有什么事？”这时，琼斯倒从这位先生的声调、相貌和衣着上认 出他来了，就大声说道："啊，好朋友，咱们握握手吧。我希望咱们不要为 了很久以前发生的一点小小误会彼此还记恨在心吧。”
"天哪，先生，"费兹帕特利说，"我既不晓得您的名字，也不认得您的 面孔。皿当然，先生，"琼斯说，"我也不晓得您的名字，可是我记得很清 楚曾在厄普顿见过您，咱们还在那里糊里糊涂吵了一架；要是咱们还没和 解的话，那么咱们现在就喝上一瓶酒和解了吧。”
"在厄普顿！"费兹帕特利嚷道，"啊，您准是叫琼斯吧！""不错，"琼 斯回答说，"我就是。""啊，"费兹帕特利嚷道，"我找的就是你。等一下我 再同你喝酒。可是我先在你的狗头上揍一下。给你一下，你这个流氓！你 要是不跟我决斗，我就再揍你一下。"然后，他就拔出剑来摆出防御的架势 ――这是他所懂得的唯一本领。
这一击完全出乎琼斯的意外，他的身子摇晃了一下，但是一站稳了 脚，就也拔出剑来。尽管他不会击剑，还是不顾一切地向费兹帕特利逼过 去，冲破了对方的防御，把半支剑刺进了费兹帕特利的身体。那位先生被
刺伤后，立刻倒退下来，剑尖朝地，倚着剑柄嚷道："不能再斗下去了，我 已经完了。”
"但愿不至于那样，"琼斯大声说，"可是不管会发生什么事，你总该明 白事情是你挑起来的。"这时，一些人拥了上来，抓住琼斯。琼斯说他决不 抵抗，并且要求他们至少照顾一下那位受伤的先生。
"哼，"一个汉子喊道，"受伤的先生会受到照顾的，我看他活不上几个 钟头了。至于阁下，你至少还能活一个月。皿妈的，杰克，"另一个汉子 说，"这下他用不着到海外去啦。他该去的是另一个码头。"他们拿可怜的 琼斯开了不少这类的玩笑。这些家伙其实是费拉玛勋爵雇的。他们尾随他 来到费兹帕特利太太家。刚才那件不幸发生的时候，这些人正在街角上等 待着他。
最后，指挥这帮人的军官很明智地说，现在他的责任是把犯人交给民 事法官去办理。因此，他吩咐把琼斯押到一家酒店去，派人叫来一名警 吏，犯人就移交给他了。
警吏看到琼斯先生穿得很考究，又听说事情是决斗时发生的，对犯人 就格外客气。在琼斯的请求之下，又派人去探视了一下那位受伤的先生伤 势如何；这时他正在一家酒店里，由一位外科医生治疗。派去的人回报 说，伤势是致命的，决无生望。警吏听到后，就告诉琼斯必须到法官面前 去受审。琼斯回答说："随便把我押到哪儿去都成。怎么处治我，我也不在 乎。尽管我自信在法律面前并没有犯凶杀罪，可是叫那人流了那么多血， 我心里实在受不住。”
于是，琼斯就被带到法官面前。那个替费兹帕特利先生救治的外科医 生也出庭作证，他说伤势是致命的。于是，犯人就被押到监牢里去。当时 天色已经很晚了，琼斯要等到天明才能派人去叫巴特里奇。他直到七点钟 才合上眼，所以将近十二点巴特里奇才得到消息，这可怜的家伙等了主人 好久未见回来，非常害怕，现在更吓得简直没了魂儿。
他双膝发抖，心怦怦地跳着走进监牢。一来到琼斯跟前，就哭哭啼啼 地哀叹他所遭到的不幸，不断心惊胆战地东张西望着。这时，听说费兹帕 特利先生死了，这个可怜的家伙时刻担心那鬼魂会跑进房来。最后，他递 给琼斯一封信一一他几乎给忘了。这是苏菲亚托黑乔治送来的。
琼斯立刻把房里所有的人都打发出去，急忙拆开信。信里说：
我所以再一次给你写信，是因为有一件事使我感到十分诧异。适才我姑姑给我看了一封 你写给贝拉斯顿夫人的信，其中提到向她求婚一事。我确信那是你的笔迹。更令我惊骇的是， 从日期上看你写该信的时候，也即是你要我相信你正为我而忧虑不已的时候......这件事由你自 去评论吧。我唯一祈愿的是：永远也不再听到你的名字。
苏,魏
关于琼斯先生此时此刻的心境以及他所受的痛苦折磨，我们只能用这 样一句话来给读者一个清晰的概念：他不幸到连屠瓦孔几乎也会同情他 了。情势虽然很不妙，我们也只好暂时让他忍受下去，就像他的守护神 (倘若他真有一位守护神的话)目前所做的那样。这里，我们就把第十六 卷结束了。

三天里的事
第一章
包括一部分开场白
每当一位喜剧家已经使他的主要人物登上幸福的顶点，或者一位悲剧 家已经把他的主要人物引到苦难的深渊时，他们就都认为他们该做的事都 已做完，底下，作品就应收尾了。
倘若我们这部作品属于悲剧性质，读者一定会同意我们现在差不多也 临到收尾阶段了，因为就是魔鬼或者他在世间的任何代表，也难以替可怜 的琼斯安排出比上一章他所陷入的更痛苦的处境。至于苏菲亚，一个好心 肠的女人即使对自己的情敌，也不可能希望她的心境比苏菲亚目前想必会 感到的更加忐忑不安。要结束这出悲剧的话，只消再杀上一两个人，写上 几句警世的话也就尽够了！
但是如果要把我们所喜爱的人物从目前的愁苦忧患中拯救出来，让他 们终于登上幸福之岸，这好像要艰难多了一一艰难得我们简直不敢承担。 说到苏菲亚，我们最后多半会替她物色上一个好夫婿一一不是布利非，就 是那位爵爷，要不，也许旁的什么人。至于可怜的琼斯呢，由于他轻率行 事，已陷入悲惨境地（即使在法律上还没判作重刑犯，他干的事至少已经 使他自觉难逃法网）。如今，他既没有朋友可呼救，又受到敌人的煎逼， 我们几乎无法指望使他得到什么转机一一倘若读者喜欢看执行死刑的情景 的话，我想他应该赶快到泰堡［1］去抢个头排位置。
我忠诚地向大家担保一定做到这一点：不论人们认为我们对这个流氓 有多少偏爱，而且不幸我们又使他成为本书的主人公，可是我们绝不借用 超自然的力量来搭救他一一我们虽然被赋予了这种力量，不到紧要关头， 是不得动用的。因此，即使他找不到什么自然的办法来彻底摆脱他陷入的 苦难，我们也绝不为了救他而损害这部历史的真实性和尊严。我们宁可去 叙述他在泰堡处了绞刑（事情很可能就是这样），也不愿牺牲我们的诚 实，或者辜负读者的信任。
在这方面，古人要比今人有利多了。当时，一般人对神话比现今人们 对任何宗教还要深信不疑，这样，就便于古代作家使他们心爱的主人公化 险为夷。作家身边总有些神祇可供驱使，什么吩咐都能照办。虚构得越怪 诞，轻信的读者就越觉得离奇可喜。那时的作家把主人公从甲国搬到乙
国，甚至从这个世界搬到另一个世界，又再搬回来，要比束手束脚的可怜 的现代作家把他的主人公从监牢里救出来还要容易得多。
阿拉伯人和波斯人依仗精灵和仙子来写故事也同样便当。他们根据 《可兰经》本身的权威，将仙灵视为信条。可是我们不能借助于这些东 西。我们只能使用自然的办法。那么，看看用这样的办法我们能替可怜的 琼斯帮些什么忙吧。老实说，冥冥中有人告诉我，琼斯还不晓得他将倒霉 到什么地步，一个比他所已听到的更加骇人的消息还有待命运那本书没打 开过的篇章来揭晓呢。
第二章
密勒太太高贵的报恩举动
奥尔华绥先生和密勒太太刚坐下来用早饭，大清早就外出的布利非回 来了，他们就一道吃饭。
布利非坐下没多久，就这么说开了 ："哎呀，亲爱的舅父，您猜发生什 么事情了 ？我简直不敢告诉您，怕使您回想起曾经对一个恶棍施过恩而感 到震惊。""什么事呀，孩子？”舅父问道，"恐怕我这辈子对不值得施恩的 人而施了恩的，不止一回了。可是善行并不收养它的对象的罪恶行 为。""啊，舅父，"布利非说，"您提到'收养'，想必冥冥中有上天指引着 您。您所收养的那个儿子，那个琼斯，您一心一意抚养大的那个东西，现 在已经成为世上头号的坏蛋了。""我指着一切神明起誓，这是扯谎，"密勒 太太说道，"琼斯先生不是什么坏蛋。他是顶值得景仰的人了。要是旁的人 说他是坏蛋，我就一定把这壶开水统统浇在他脸上。"奥尔华绥先生看到这 般光景，感到非常诧异。但是密勒太太不等他开口，就朝他大声说道："希 望您不要生我的气。我万也不肯惹您生气。可是听到有人说琼斯先生是坏 蛋，我决不能容忍。""太太，"奥尔华绥十分庄重地说，"我必须承认，听 到您这么激动地替一个素不相识的家伙辩护而感到有些惊讶。""啊，奥尔 华绥先生，我认得他！"她说，"我确实认得他。我要是不这么承认，我就 是个最忘恩负义的人了。啊，他搭救了我和我这小小的家庭。我们只要活 着一天，就应该祝福他一天。我祈求上天保佑他，并且改变仇恨他的人的 狠毒心肠。我晓得、我发现、我看出他是有仇人的。皿太太，"奥尔华绥 说，"您这么一说更令我吃惊了。您指的准是另外一个人。您不可能欠我外 甥提的这个人什么情分的。""一点也没错，"她回答说，"我欠他无比深重 的情分。他是我自己和我一家人的救命恩人。先生，请相信我，人家在您 面前毁谤了他，粗暴地毁谤了他。我知道您一向是最仁厚、最光明磊落 的，过去我听您说过许多疼爱体贴这个可怜的孤苦伶仃的孩子的话；准是 有人毁谤了他，在您面前恶毒地毁谤了他，不然的话，您决不会轻蔑地称 他作'家伙'的。真的，我的恩人，要是您像我那样听到他提起您来时说的那 些亲切、友好、感恩的话，您就会同意给他一个更和善的称呼的。每逢提 到您的名字，他总是满口颂扬。我亲眼看到他就跪在这个房间里，祈求上 天赐福给您。他爱您一点也不下于我爱我这个女儿。”
"舅父，"布利非龇着牙冷笑了一声（这种冷笑是魔鬼在它的宠儿身上 留下的标志），说道："如今我看出密勒太太确实认识他。您大概会发现他 不仅是对密勒太太，而且还在您的其他熟人面前诋毁您。从这位太太刚才 说话的口气里，可以听出他对我的名誉更是极其随便地糟蹋。可是我饶恕 他。""先生，但愿上帝也饶恕你！"密勒太太说，"我们个个都有罪，都需 要上帝的饶恕。”
"哦，密勒太太，"奥尔华绥说，"我不认为您对我外甥的态度是友善 的，因为所有您影射他而讲的一些话，必然都是出自那个败类：这种影射 也只能使我加深对那个败类的愤怒一一如果还有可能加深的话。密勒太 太，您要知道：此刻站在您面前的这个青年一直在替您所袒护的那个忘恩 负义的家伙辩护。只要听到了我亲口告诉您这些，您想必就会奇怪他怎么 会这样卑鄙、这样忘恩负义了吧。”
"先生，您受骗了，"密勒太太回答说，"即使到了临终，我也要说您是 受骗了。我再重复一遍：但愿上帝饶恕那些哄骗您的人。我并不硬说那个 年轻人没有过失，但那完全是由于年幼冒失，不知检点，我相信他一定会 改掉的；即使改不掉，他那颗最仁厚、温暖、诚实的心也足以弥补他这些 过失而有余了。”
"密勒太太，"奥尔华绥说，"老实说，如果旁人转告我您这番话，我是 —定不会相信的。""先生，"她说，"您一定会相信我所说的，我准知道您 会的。当您听完我下面告诉您的事（我一定原原本本全告诉您），您不但 不会生我的气，还会承认（我十分清楚您为人是多么正派）如果我不是抱 这种态度，那我倒是世上最可鄙、最忘恩负义的人了。”
"好吧，太太，"奥尔华绥说，"我必须承认您刚才的态度需要些解释， 所以我很愿意听您来作一番合理的解释。不过，太太，先让我的外甥把话 讲完，请您别打岔。他既然先说了那么一段话，事情必然很不寻常，甚至 也许还会把您的错误纠正过来呢。”
密勒太太表示从命，于是，布利非先生讲道："舅父，如果您认为对密 勒太太这种无礼不应见怪，那么她中伤我本人的部分，我是可以原谅的。 不过，我觉得您对她一番好心，不应该结果反而遭到她这样的侮辱。""那 么，孩子，"奥尔华绥说，"又有了什么新的情况？他最近又干出什么事来 啦什么？”布利非大声说，"尽管密勒太太那么说，我向您叙述的时候 还是很难过的；倘若事情不是已经到了瞒不住人的地步，您也决不会从我
嘴里听到的。一句话，他杀了一个人。我不说这是谋杀，也许法庭不那么 认为；为了他的缘故，我总是往好里盼望。”
奥尔华绥看来+分震动，在胸前画了个+字；然后对密勒太太嚷 道："哦，太太，现在您还说什么？"
"啊，先生，"她回答说，"我要说，我一辈子再没遇到过哪件事比这更 令我难过的了。如果事情真是这样的话，不管死的是谁，我相信一定是那 人的过错。天晓得这京城里有多少流氓地痞，专门招惹年轻绅士们。只有 极端无理的挑衅才会迫使他去还手。因为在我所有的房客当中，没有比他 更文雅、性子更柔和的了。凡住在我这里的，以及来这里串门的人，谁都 喜爱他。”
密勒太太正这样说着的时候，突然一阵猛烈的敲门声打断了他们的谈 话，使她讲不下去，也听不到别人的回答了。因为她断定客人是来访问奥 尔华绥先生的，她就赶快带着她的小女儿走开了。那小姑娘听到关于琼斯 的悲惨消息，眼里噙满了泪水一一琼斯常称她作小娘子，不但给她买了许 多玩具，还花上不少时间亲自陪她玩。
有的读者也许乐于读这些细节，作者就仿效一位杰出的同行，历史家 普鲁塔克的范例来叙述一番；其他读者也许嫌这些细节过于烦琐，希望也 能加以包涵，因为交代细节的时候，我们决不会很啰嗦的。
第三章
魏斯顿先生的来临；顺便谈谈对父权的一些看法
密勒太太走出房间没多久，魏斯顿先生就进来了。进门之前，他先和 抬轿子的吵了一场。那几个汉子从赫剌克勒斯柱石旅馆把他抬来，估计这 位乡绅不会再是他们的好主顾了，又因为乡绅手头来得很大方（付轿钱的 时候他主动多给了他们六个便士），这下倒壮了他们的胆，就要乡绅再多 出一个先令。乡绅恼了，他不但在内外把抬轿子的痛骂了一通，进屋以后 怒气还没消，口口声声说所有的伦敦人都跟宫廷一个样，专门掠夺乡绅 们。"妈的，"他说，"我宁可淋着雨走路也再不愿意钻到他们这种鬼轿子里 去了！这一哩路颠得我比骑着我那匹棕色贝丝跑远路去猎狐还要辛苦！”
这场气刚刚平息了一些，魏斯顿先生又为另一件事发起火来。他 说："瞧瞧，真能耍花招呀。原来猎狗改了主意。早先我们以为追的是只狐 狸，哦，结果是一只獾! ”
"好街坊，"奥尔华绥说，"请您先别打比方，讲明白点吧。""那么，干 脆告诉你吧，"乡绅说，"我们一直担心的是个婊子养的杂种一一我也说不 清是哪个养的，这我可不知道；可是如今又出来一个婊子养的勋爵，说不 定他也是个杂种。不管怎么样，我决不答应把女儿嫁给他。这些贵族已经 把咱们国家吃成叫花子了，他们休想再把我也吃成叫花子。我决不能让我 的田产落到汉诺威王室手里。”
"好朋友，这话可很令我吃惊，"奥尔华绥说。"是呀，我自个儿也吃惊 不小，"乡绅回答说，"昨天晚上我妹妹魏斯顿约我去看她一趟。我一进 去，屋里坐满了女人。有我的表亲贝拉斯顿夫人，有贝蒂夫人、凯瑟琳夫 人和一些我叫不出名字的夫人。妈的，我一辈子还没落到这么一大群穿大 蓬裙的母狗手里过，我情愿像故事里的那个变成了一只野兔，给他自己的 猎狗咬死、吃掉的阿克泰翁⑵，被我自己的猎狗追逐。畜生，没有人给逼得 像我这个样子：往一边跑，给这个截住；往后跑，又给那个抓住。’唷，当 然是全英国最如意的一门亲事喽，’”乡绅这时试着模仿太太们的口气，"一 位表亲说；’这门亲事结起来的确很合算，’另外一位表亲嚷着（你晓得，这 些女人有一半我从来也没见过，可她们全是我的表亲）。’表哥，’那个胖骚 娘儿们贝拉斯顿夫人说，’要拒绝这门亲事，那你准是发疯了。
"现在我慢慢懂啦，"奥尔华绥说，"有人向魏斯顿小姐求婚，您家族里 的妇女都赞成，但是不中您的意。”
"不中我的意！"魏斯顿说，"当然喽！告诉你那是个勋爵，你晓得我一 向拿定主意不跟这类人打交道。有个贵族想按四十年收益的价钱买我一块 地当猎场，我就是不干，因为我不愿意和贵族打交道。我怎么会把闺女嫁 给一个贵族！而且，我不是把她许配你家了吗？我讲好的生意，几时曾不 认账过？ ”
"至于这一点，"奥尔华绥说，"好街坊，我可以完全解除你受到的约 束。如果双方在缔约的时候都不具备全权，事后任何一方也一直没有力量 去履行契约，那么任何契约就都没有约束力了。”
"哼，"魏斯顿回答说，"告诉你吧，我有这个权利，而且我一定要照规 定的去办。马上跟我到民法博士会馆［3］去，我领一张结婚证书，然后就到我 妹妹那里，把那丫头硬给拖来，她非嫁给他不可。她要是不肯的话，我就 把她关一辈子，只供给她面包和白水。”
"魏斯顿先生，"奥尔华绥说，"您可以听我说说我对这个问题的全部意 见吗？""听您说？当然可以，”魏斯顿说。"好，先生，"奥尔华绥大声 说，"我既不是奉承您，也不是恭维小姐。平心而言，当初一提这桩婚事， 由于敬重你们二位，我立刻就由衷地赞成了。我想咱们两家是紧邻，一向 来往很亲密，感情又很融洽，成为姻亲是再好不过了。说到府上的小姐， 不但所有认识她的人都这么看，根据我自己的观察，我也深信她一定会成 为一个好丈夫的无价之宝。先不去说她的美德，那当然是十分可钦的：她 的善良、仁慈和谦逊是尽人皆知的，用不着赞扬。可是在这位小姐身上还 具有一种在天仙般的最贤淑的妇女身上才充分地找得到的品质，由于这种 品质并不显眼，所以往往不为人所注意；很少人提到它，以致我竟找不出 一个字眼来表达它。这里，我只能用否定语气来说明。我从没听到她口中 说过孟浪的话或者所谓的辞令。她向来不卖弄机智，更不去表现那种只有 渊博的学识和丰富的经验才能有的真知灼见。一个年轻姑娘要去装得那么 明智，只能像一只猴子装模作样时那么荒唐可笑。她从来也不固执己见， 不下断语，不作深奥的评论。每逢我看到她和男人在一起的时候，她总是 以谦虚的学习者的心情倾听旁人，而不是以一个教师的态度那么侃侃而 谈。请原谅我：有一回只为了试她一试，我曾经要求她对屠瓦孔先生和斯 奎尔先生所争论的问题表示一下意见。她以令人+分愉快的神情回答
说：’亲爱的奥尔华绥先生，请您原谅我。我相信您不会真的以为我能解决 这样两位先生所争论的问题。’屠瓦孔和斯奎尔都期待她作出有利于自己的 解答，所以他们也附和我对她提出的请求。她同样和颜悦色地对他们 说：’我一定得求您们原谅，我决不愿表示意见，免得开罪任何一方。’对于 男人的见解，她确实一向都极为尊重一一这是做一个贤惠妻子所必不可少 的品质。我只再补充一点：您的小姐完全不矫揉造作，所以她的那种尊重 必然是由衷的。”
这时，布利非深深地叹了 口气。魏斯顿听见对苏菲亚的这番赞美，眼 眶里充满了泪水。及至听到布利非这么一叹气，他就呜咽着说："别泄气！ 她是你的人。妈的，就是她再好上二十倍，也是你的。”
“阁下别忘记刚才答应我的，"奥尔华绥大声说，"您答应不来插嘴 的。""好吧，"乡绅回答说，"不啦，一个字也不说啦。”
"喏，好朋友，"奥尔华绥接着说下去，"我所以用这么多时间来谈令媛 的优点，一则因为我确实喜爱她这种性格，二则为了使您不要以为我是从 财产着眼才这么热衷于这门亲事的一一就财产而论，我外甥确实也沾光不 少。真的，我满心希望能把这一块宝迎纳到我们家来。可是，尽管我向往 许许多多好东西，我却不肯去偷盗，或使用任何暴力或不正当的手段去把 它们据为己有。那么，违反一个女人的愿望，或者没得到她的同意就强迫 她嫁人是不公道的，那是一种压迫行为，但愿我国的法律会明文禁止。但 是纵使在一个法纪最松弛的国家里，一个有良心的人也不会胡作非为的； 他会替自己订出立法者所忘记订的法律。当前显然就是这么一种情况。女 人一旦结了婚，她的一举一动都要对那至高无上的最可怕的法庭负责，冒 着灵魂会遭到沉沦的危险；违反她的意志，强迫她陷入这种境地难道不是 残酷，甚至是亵渎神明的吗？ 一个做妻子的把份内的职责完成得很好并不 是件容易的事，那么我们怎么可以把这个重担子压在女人身上，同时却把 足以支持她忍受这一重担的那股力量全部剥夺掉呢？当她用全副心思几乎 都完不成我们所要她尽的职责时，我们怎么还能去撕破她的心呢？这里， 我必须说个明白。我认为这样做的父母，在他们子女日后所犯的一切罪过 中都负有一部分责任，因而在一位公正的审判官面前，也一定会同样受到 惩罚。但是如果他们受不到惩罚的话，天哪，那么什么人又会忍心在使自 己的孩子堕入地狱方面加上一把力呢？
"好街坊，为了这些原因，我既然看出令媛这样厌恶我的外甥，对您仍 然想以我外甥为婿的那份光荣，我只好谢绝了，尽管我将永远保留对您这 番盛意的感激。”
"好，先生，"魏斯顿（塞子一拔开，他口里就吐沫乱飞）说，"你可不 能说我没好好听完你讲的话，现在你也该听我讲讲了。要是我有一个字儿 答复不出来，那么我就同意不再提这门亲事了。那么，首先我要你回答我 一个问题：这丫头是不是我的？回答我这个：她是不是我的？大家说，只 有贤明的父亲才了解自己的子女，这话一点儿也不差。但是我相信我对她 最有权威，因为是我把她抚养大的。我想你也一定承认我是她的老子吧。 既然我是她的老子，难道她不该归我管？我问你：我自己的孩子难道不该 归我管？要是她旁的方面归我管，这件终身大事当然也该归我管喽。那么 我对她又有什么希望呢？我希望她为我做点什么，给我一些什么吗？…… 恰恰相反，我只不过要她先分去我一半财产，等我死后，把那一半也拿过 去。那么，我这为的是什么？还不是为了叫她幸福。有些人说的话听了真 叫我生气。要是我自己想续弦，那么她这么哭哭啼啼，也还有道理；如今 刚好相反，我已经表示要把田产的权利固定下来，这样，即便我想续弦， 也续不成了，因为天底下不会再有任何女人肯嫁我了。我这不是已经做到 家了吗？我倒是害了她了！哼，我宁愿看到全世界都堕入地狱，也不愿让 她伤着一根小指！真的，奥尔华绥先生，你得原谅我。可是听到你那么 说，我大吃一惊。不管你高不高兴吧，老实说，我一向认为你总还有些头 脑的。”
奥尔华绥听了这句指摘的话，虽有些气恼，也只是笑了笑；笑里决不 夹杂任何恶意或轻蔑一一即便他想这样做，他也不会。奥尔华绥对愚蠢举 动露出的笑容令人想到天使对人类的荒唐行为的宽容。
这时，布利非要求让他讲几句话："说到对小姐使用什么暴力，那我是 一定不会同意的。我的良心不允许我对任何人使用暴力，更不会对这样一 位小姐；不管她对我多么残酷，我对她将永远保持最纯洁、最真挚的爱 情。不过，我在书中读到过这样的话：经得起坚持不懈的追求的女人是很 少的。那么凭着这样一番坚持不懈的追求，又焉知我就没希望哪一天赢得 她那颗心呢？何况将来我大概再也没有敌手了。至于那位勋爵，承魏斯顿 先生不弃，他已经表示，比较起来他还是属意于我。先生，您总不能不承 认在这类事情上，做父母的至少有权表示不赞成吧。而且我听说苏菲亚小
姐本人就这么说过不止一次，她认为做子女的在婚事上如果直接违反父母 的意志，那是不可原谅的。同时，尽管她府上旁的女眷对那位勋爵很垂 青，可是我发现小姐本人并不把他看在眼里。这一点我是完全清楚的。我 也明白她心上最想念的还是那个邪恶透顶的坏蛋。”
"正是这样，正是这样，"魏斯顿嚷道。
“但是如果小姐晓得他犯了凶杀罪，”布利非说，"即便法律饶他一 命……”
"什么？"魏斯顿喊道，"凶杀！他犯了凶杀罪吗？有希望看到他上绞刑 架吗？咦，嗒啦啦，嗒啦啦，"他满屋子里连唱带舞起来。
"孩子，"奥尔华绥说，"你在爱情上遭到的不幸，使我心里很难过。我 打心里同情你，愿意用一切正当办法帮助你成功。”
"那正是我最大的愿望，"布利非大声说，"我相信我亲爱的舅父不会把 我想得那么坏，以为除了正当的办法之外，我会接受什么旁的帮助。”
"听明白了，"奥尔华绥说，"只要那位小姐不反对，你尽可以给她写 信，去拜望她，可是决不许存任何强制的念头。不许用禁闭或类似的办 法。"
"好吧，好吧，”乡绅嚷道，"不使用那种办法。咱们试试温和的办法， 看看效果怎么样。要是那家伙立刻给绞死，没有碍事的就好了一一嗒啦 啦！这真是空前的好消息……嘿，万事都正如我所期望的……啊，亲爱的 奥尔华绥，务必请你同我到赫剌克勒斯柱石旅馆吃饭去，我已经订下一月 烤羊肩肉，还有猪排骨、鸡和蛋汁。要是不想把旅馆老板约上的话，座上 只有咱们二人，因为我把烟草盒落在贝辛斯托克的一家客栈里了，我打发 撒波尔牧师去替我取回来；那烟草盒是我的老相识，跟我二十多年了，我 不能把它丢掉。我可以告诉你，这个旅馆老板是个非常逗乐的家伙，你一 定会十分喜欢他。”
奥尔华绥先生终于接受了这个邀请。过一会儿，乡绅就边唱边舞地跑 开了，满心为不幸的琼斯即将遭到的悲惨下场而高兴。
乡绅走后，奥尔华绥先生又带着庄重的神色回到上述那个话题上去。 他对他的外甥说："我实在无法使你对这种情欲抱什么成功的幻想，我满心 期待你肯予以压制。认为凭坚持不懈的追求就能克服一个女人对自己的憎 恶，这确是个庸人之见。有时，冷漠也许可以在这种追求面前让步，不 过，一个情人通常靠坚持不懈的追求所能克服的，只是对方的变化无常、
谨小慎微和矫揉造作。有些不很痴情的女人，往往由于过度轻浮，就故意 延长男方追求的时间，以满足她们的虚荣心；甚至对她们颇为中意、并且 已经下定决心（如果她们还有这么一天的话）最后给他一些菲薄报偿的男 人，也是如此。然而如果女方抱的是不可改变的憎恶心情，时间只会加深 这种憎恶，而不会克服的。而且，亲爱的外甥，我还有一层忧虑，说出来 请你不要见怪。我担心你对这位可敬的小姐的情欲过于以她的美貌为目 标，而那是不配称作爱情的，而爱情才是美满婚姻的唯一基础。赞美、喜 欢并渴望占有一个漂亮女人而丝毫不管她对我们怎样感觉，这恐怕是很自 然的事。但是我相信只有爱情才能产生爱情。至少我深信，明明晓得一个 女人恨自己，可还去爱她，那是违反人性的。因此，好孩子，你仔细省察 一下自己，倘若你觉得内心有一丝一毫这种情况，那么我相信你自己的道 德和宗教都会迫使你把这种邪恶的情感从你的胸膛里驱逐掉，你自己的良 知也会使你毫无痛苦地做到这一点。”
读者大概不难猜出布利非怎样答复这番话。不过，倘若猜不出，我们 此刻也没工夫来点明了，因为我们必须赶快来叙述这部历史更重要的事， 而我们也舍不得与苏菲亚久别。
第四章
苏菲亚和她姑妈之间很不寻常的_幕
哞哞低鸣着的母牛犊和咩咩叫着的母羊羔，尽可成群地在牧场上溜 达，十分安全，没人去理会。诚然，它们以后注定要成为人类的口中食， 但这种逍遥自在的生活它们可以享受若干年，不受干扰。倘若一只肥壮的 母鹿从森林里跑了出来，想在野地或树丛左近歇息一下，只要被人发觉， 立刻就会惊动整个教区，个个都准备放出猎狗去追逐它。这时，如果一位 好心的乡绅出面把它保全下来，那也不过是为了留给他自己吃。
我时常想，一位财貌双全的上流小姐一旦走出绣房，她的处境和那只 母鹿也差不多。全城立即哄动起来。人们从公园追到戏院，从宫廷追到社 交场所，从社交场所又追到她的闺房，往往不上三个月就会落到这个或那 个男人的魔爪；因为倘若她的朋友保护她，不让她被某些人弄到手，那也 不过是为了把她交给他们所选中的、往往比所有那些男人都更加讨厌的一 个。可是这时候，其他成群结队的女人却安然无事地出入公园、戏院、歌 剧院和社交场所，几乎没人理会；她们中间的大多数固然将来也终必落入 男人掌中，可是她们在很长时间内可以自由自在，不受谁的干扰或控制。
在漂亮小姐当中，再没有谁比可怜的苏菲亚遭到更多这种折磨的了。 她的噩运还不仅止于布利非带给她的种种灾难，如今又为她招来一个追求 者，看来这个给她的折磨将不亚于布利非。因为尽管她姑妈来得没那么粗 暴，可是她也和乡绅以前一样死死地纠缠着她。
魏斯顿女士事先已经向苏菲亚提过这件事。所以饭后仆人一退下去， 她就通知侄女说，当天下午勋爵就要来拜望，她自己要尽早脱身，好让苏 菲亚和勋爵单独会见。"您要是走开的话，姑姑，"苏菲亚带着些激动回答 说，"那么我也尽早丢下他走开。""哦，小姐！"她姑妈大声说道，"你父亲 把你关起来，我救了你出来，难道这就是你对我的报答吗姑姑，您晓 得，"苏菲亚说，"他关我是因为我不肯依从他去嫁给一个我所厌恶的人。 亲爱的姑姑，您既然把我从灾难中救了出来，难道又要把我投进一场同样 可怕的灾难吗那么，小姐，"魏斯顿女士回答说，"难道你认为费拉玛 勋爵和布利非之间就毫无区别了吗？皿我认为区别不大，”苏菲亚嚷 道，"如果我注定非嫁一个不可的话，那我还宁愿为了讨我爹的欢心而牺牲 自己呢。""这么看来，"她的姑妈说，"对于取得我的欢心，你并不怎么在
意。可是我也不会因为这种考虑而改变主张。我是出于更崇高的动机才这 样做的，目的是为了光大咱们的门第，抬高你的地位。难道你就不想飞黄 腾达？难道你就不向往在你的马车上画有贵族纹章吗？""我用人格向您保 证，决不，"苏菲亚说，"我的车子上就是有个针垫，我也同样高兴。""别 提什么人格了，"那位姑妈嚷道，"从你这个浑蛋嘴里说出来太不相称。侄 女，对不起，是你逼我使出这类字眼的，可是你那种自甘卑下的性格实在 叫我没法忍受。在你身上找不到一滴魏斯顿家族的血。可是不管你自己的 想法有多么下贱，没出息，你也不能归罪于我。我决不能让人说，是我怂 恿你拒绝举国难找的这么一门好亲事的。对方不但比咱们阔，任何家庭有 这么一位女婿，都一定会大增光彩；论门第，人家也远远胜过咱们。""当 然，我生来就有缺陷，"苏菲亚说，"没有旁人所具备的感觉。世上一定有 着能够享受声势和排场的感觉，我就没有；不然的话，他们就决不会花那 么大力气，那么不顾一切地去攫取在他们看来（我也认为）是毫不足道的 东西，而得到后，也不会那么兴高采烈，那么自豪。”
"不是这样，不是这样，小姐，"姑妈嚷道，"你生来同旁人一样具有那 些感觉的，不过，你还没有足够的头脑来愚弄我，或者叫我在世人面前丢 丑。所以我郑重向你声明一一我相信你也晓得我是多么坚决：要是你不肯 答应今天下午会见爵爷，那么明天早晨我就亲自把你交给你爹，从此以后 我再也不过问你的事，也不再见你一面。"这段话是用极其气愤而又果断的 语调讲出的。苏菲亚听了之后，站在那里半晌说不出话来。然后，她声泪 俱下地叫着："姑姑，随您怎么处置我吧。我是世上最孤苦无助的人。要是 我亲爱的姑姑再抛弃我，我可到哪儿找保护人去啊。""亲爱的侄女，"她大 声说，"那位爵爷将成为你最好的保护人。如果你不是对那个坏蛋琼斯还恋 恋不舍，没有旁的会使你拒绝这样一位保护人的。皿姑姑，您真冤枉了 我，”苏菲亚说，"如果我曾经对他有过什么好感，经您给我看过那封信 后，我怎么还能不把那些好感永远抛掉？如果您还不放心的话，我愿意为 这件事郑重发誓，永不再见他一面。""可是孩子，亲爱的孩子，”她姑妈 说，"你要放明白点。你对那位爵爷能想得出一点可挑剔的地方吗我想 我已经告诉过您的那件事就足够了，"苏菲亚回答说。"什么事？"她姑妈大 声说，"我不记得你告诉过我什么。""姑姑，”苏菲亚说，"我确实告诉过 您，他曾对我十分无礼，十分下流。""孩子，”她说，"这我倒确实没听你 说过，要不就是我没明白你的意思……你说的'无礼'和'下流'究竟指的是什
么？”"姑姑，"苏菲亚说，"老实说，我简直不好意思告诉您。他把我搂到 怀里，推倒在睡椅上，把手插到我胸口，使勤乱亲，此刻我的左胸上还有 伤痕呢。""这是真的吗？”魏斯顿女士问道。"姑姑，确实是这样，"苏菲亚 回答说，"幸亏这时我爹进来了。不然的话，天晓得他还要干出什么无礼的 事来。""这真叫我又惊奇又生气，"她姑妈嚷道，"自从有了魏斯顿这个家 族，咱们家还没有一个女人遭遇到过这种事。如果谁敢这么对我放肆，哪 怕他是个王子，我也要把他的眼珠子抠出来。这是不可能的！苏菲亚，你 一定是编出这番话来叫我生他的气。""姑姑，”苏菲亚说，"我希望您总不 至于认为我会说谎话。凭良心说，这都是事实。""我要是在场的话，就非 用刀子扎进他的心窝不可，"她姑姑说，"可是他不会有什么不体面的企图 的，这不可能！他也不敢。从他求婚这件事来看，也说明他没那种打算。 他是正大光明来求婚的，而且条件也很优厚。我也说不清了。这个时代的 风气太放肆了。在我看来，结婚之前男女只许可遥遥点点头。过去，我也 有过情人，而且这是不久以前的事。好几个男人追求我。我不肯结婚，也 决不允许他们稍稍放肆一些。这是一种愚蠢的风俗，我是决不赞成的。男 人至多只能吻我的脸蛋儿。对丈夫，充其量也只能让他亲亲嘴唇。而且， 万一有一天我肯嫁个男人的话，就是这一点我也不能立刻忍受的。""亲爱 的姑姑，"苏菲亚说，"对不起，我想说出自己的一点看法。您承认自己有 过不少情人，即使您不承认，世人也晓得您有过的。您把所有的人全拒绝 了，其中，我相信至少有一个是贵族。皿亲爱的苏菲，”她说，"这话不 假。曾经有一个带爵位的人向我求过婚。""那么，这回您为什么不允许我 也拒绝一个贵族的求婚？”苏菲亚问道。"孩子，"她说，"那是真的，我拒 绝过一个有爵位的人，然而那门亲事并不那么好，也就是说，不像你遇到 的那么好得很。""是的，姑姑，"苏菲亚说，"不过，曾经有许多大财主向 您求过婚。这样的好亲事，向您提过决不止一次、两次或者三次呀。""我 不得不承认，确实是这样，"她说。"那么，姑姑，"苏菲亚接着说，"为什 么我就不可以再等一回呢？也许下一回会比这回的强些。您现在年纪还 轻，当然不会一遇上有钱或有爵位的求婚，立刻就答应下来。我的年纪也 还轻得很，当然用不着绝望吧。""哎，亲爱的苏菲，"她姑妈嚷道，"你可 叫我怎么说好呢？""我只求您不要把我一个人丢下，至少今天下午别这么 做。您要是答应我这一点，并且认为尽管在发生过那样的事之后，我仍应 在您的陪同下接见他的话，我愿意服从您。""好吧，我答应你，"她姑妈嚷
道，"苏菲，你晓得我是疼爱你的，所以我什么也不会拒绝你。你也晓得我 天性有多么好说话，可我并不总这么好说话。以前，有人认为我很残忍 ――我指的是男人。他们管我叫残忍的帕尔赞妮撒％我曾经打破过多少扇 贴着《赠残忍的帕尔赞妮撒》诗文的窗户。苏菲，我长得从来也没你这么 漂亮，可是以前我多少还有些像你。我稍微变了一点。正如图里•西塞罗在 他的《书简》里所说的，邦国要起变化，人的相貌也要起变化。"她就这样 滔滔不绝地谈自己，谈她征服的男人，谈她有多么残酷，谈了差不多半个 钟头，一直谈到那位勋爵光临。会见的时候，魏斯顿女士始终也没表示过 要回避，勋爵自觉无趣，告辞而去一一他对这位侄女和她的姑妈是同样不 满意的。苏菲亚已经把她姑妈哄得心情畅快，侄女应对的话，她几乎全都 赞同，认为对这样一个卤莽的情人，还是宜于冷淡一些。
苏菲亚就这样借着一些运用得恰到好处的恭维（当然不会有人责怪 她），为自己赢得了些许宁静，至少把这不祥的日子拖延过去了。现在， 既然我们的女主人公比她许久以来所处的境遇要顺利得多，我们就去照顾 一下琼斯先生一一可以设想，他已陷入最可悲的困境中。
第五章
密勒太太和耐廷盖尔先生到狱中探望琼斯
当奥尔华绥先生偕外甥去拜访魏斯顿先生的时候，密勒太太就到她女 婿的住所去了，好让他晓得他的朋友琼斯所遭到的不幸。可是他早已从巴 特里奇那里得知了一一因为琼斯从密勒太太家搬出去以后，耐廷盖尔先生 就在自己的寓所里为他准备了一个房间。这位好心肠的太太看到她女儿正 为琼斯先生惨遭不幸而悲痛万分，就竭力劝慰她，然后来到她听说琼斯被 关的牢狱，耐廷盖尔先生已经比她先到了。
一个忠实朋友的始终不渝的友谊对于遭受任何灾难的人都是极大的欣 慰。如果这场灾难只是暂时的，并且有解救的可能，那么这种欣慰就足以 补偿他所遭受的痛苦而有余。这种实例也并不像某些肤浅、不准确的观察 者所讲的那样罕见。老实说，缺乏同情心并不是我们的一个通病。败坏我 们心灵的毒素是嫉妒。所以每逢我们抬头看到那些显然比我们伟大、善 良、聪明或幸福的人，恐怕很少不稍微带些恶意的，而当我们俯首看到那 些处境卑微或困苦的人，往往却知道去同情和怜悯。老实说，我注意到友 谊方面出现的缺陷，大部分只是来自嫉妒。这是一种最要不得的恶行，然 而据我所知，很少人能完全避开它。不过，关于这个问题谈的也尽够了， 再说下去难免会扯得太远了。
也许命运担心琼斯会为灾难的重担压得一蹶不振，从而使它失去今后 继续折磨他的机会；也许它真的对琼斯不那么苛刻了，放松了对他的迫 害，所以才为他送来两个忠实的朋友一一也许更难得的是，还送来一个忠 实的仆人。尽管巴特里奇有许许多多缺点，但他却是满腔忠诚。虽然由于 害怕，他不会替他的主人上绞刑架，然而世人如果想贿赂他背弃自己的主 人，我相信那也是办不到的。
正当琼斯为朋友的到来而表示非常满意的时候，巴特里奇送信来说， 尽管外科医生断定费兹帕特利先生已经没有什么希望了，可是他仍然活 着。琼斯听了这话，深深地叹了一口气。耐廷盖尔对他说："我亲爱的汤 姆，你何必为这个事故这么难过呢。不管这事结果怎样，你都不用担什么 风险，你的良心丝毫也受不到责备。那家伙要是死了，那么你也不过是在 自卫中夺去一个流氓的性命而已。法院在验尸的时候自然会发现这一点 的，然后，就不难把你保释出来了。自然还要经过审讯的手续，但是乐意
自愿替你作辩护的人有的是。皿好啦，好啦，琼斯先生，”密勒太太 说，"打起精神来吧。我晓得您决不会先动手打人的，我也对奥尔华绥先生 这么讲过了。他一定得承认这一点，不然，我不会罢休的。”
琼斯庄重地回答说，不管他自己的命运如何，他总因为使一位同类流 血而感到痛心，认为这是他一生中最大的不幸。"但是我还有一件最深切的 不幸……啊，密勒太太，我失去了我在世上最珍贵的东西。""准是一位情 人，"密勒太太说，"好啦，好啦，我对情况了解得比你估料的多（因为巴 特里奇把什么全说出来了），而且我听到的比您晓得的还要多。我敢说， 事情比您设想的要好。要我押六个便士打赌布利非能娶到那位小姐，我都 不干。”
"亲爱的朋友，"琼斯回答说，"您真是完全不清楚我痛苦的原因。如果 您知道事实经过，您就会承认我是没有什么希望了。我倒不怕布利非。是 我毁了我自己的。""不要绝望，"密勒太太回答说，"您料不到一个女人能 起多大作用。凡是我做得到的，我必然都为您效劳。这是我分内应做的 事。我的女婿一一亲爱的耐廷盖尔先生晓得这是我分内应做的事，他说为 了同一件事，他也欠您的情分。我亲自去见见那位小姐好不好？您要我说 什么，我就对她说什么。”
"您真是天地间再好没有的人了，"琼斯拉着她的手嚷道，"不要说什么 欠情分的话了一一不过您既然提到愿意帮助，有一件事我倒想求求您，也 许您可以办到。看来您是认得那位小姐的一一您是怎么晓得这些情况的， 我就不得而知了。她确实是我最思念的人。如果您能设法把这个交给 她，”他从衣袋里掏出一封信递给她，"我是永远也不会忘记您这番好意 的。”
"交给我吧，"密勒太太说，"要是在睡觉之前我没把这封信交到她手 里，就让我今晚倒下不再醒来。放心吧，我的好小伙子，要学得聪明，从 过去的糊涂行为里吸取教训。我可以担保一切都会转危为安的。我还等着 看到您和这位世上最可爱的小姐（人人都这么称道她）成为幸福的一对 呢。”
"太太，"他说，"请您相信我说的并不是处在困境的人通常说的那种口 头禅。在这件可怕的事情发生之前，我就已下定决心放弃那种我逐渐懂得 是愚蠢而且罪恶的生活。尽管我在您府上闹过几次乱子（我衷心向您道 歉），我向您保证我并不是个不可救药的浪子。虽然我冒冒失失地做了许
多坏事，然而我讨厌坏人，今后我也不再做任何足以令人这么指责我的 事。”
密勒太太听了琼斯这番表白，很是满意。她说，她毫不怀疑琼斯的诚 意。在底下的谈话当中，这位好心的太太和耐廷盖尔先生一道劝琼斯先生 打起精神来，不要颓丧，这一点他们做得很成功，走时看到琼斯比他们初 来时高兴得多，也振作多了。这主要是由于密勒太太慨然答应替他把那封 信交给苏菲亚。原来他已绝望，以为无法递到一一黑乔治送来苏菲亚的前 一封信时，曾对巴特里奇说，小姐严格禁止他带回信，否则就去报告她父 亲。此外，他又发觉密勒太太这位好女人（她真是世上最可敬的人）竭力 在奥尔华绥先生面前替他辩护，自是格外欢喜。
密勒太太呆了大约一个钟头（耐廷盖尔先生来得早多了），他们就向 琼斯告别，答应不久再来看他。辞别的时候，密勒太太说，她希望下次替 他从苏菲亚那里捎来好消息，耐廷盖尔先生答应替他去了解一下费兹帕特 利先生的伤势，并且访查一下斗殴时在场的人证。
密勒太太就径直探访苏菲亚去了，我们现在也陪她一同前往。

第六章
密勒太太往访苏菲亚
会见这位小姐并不困难，因为眼下她跟她姑妈相处得很融洽，她愿意 接见谁都是可以的。
苏菲亚正在装束的时候，有人来回报说，楼下有位女客来拜访。她既 然不怕见任何女性，也没什么可害羞的，所以密勒太太立刻就被请进来 了。
两位素昧平生的女人照例行了见面礼，寒暄毕，苏菲亚就说："太太， 我还不曾拜识过您。""是的，小姐，"密勒太太回答说，"请原谅我这么冒 昧地闯了进来。可是一旦您晓得是什么事情促使我前来打扰，我希 望……""请问，太太，您有什么贵干？”苏菲亚带点不安地问。"小姐，我 想单独和您谈谈，"密勒太太小声回答说。"贝蒂，你出去，"苏菲亚说。
贝蒂走开之后，密勒太太就说："小姐，一位十分不幸的年轻绅士要我 把这封信交给您。"苏菲亚看到信皮上写的地址姓名，很熟悉那笔迹，脸色 就变了。她踌躇了一下，说道："太太，从您的外表，我真看不出您是为这 样一件事来的。这封信不管您是从谁那里带来的，我也不要看。我决不愿 意胡乱怀疑任何人，然而我完全不认识您。”
"小姐，要是您肯耐心一些，”密勒太太回答说，"我就向您说说我是 谁，和这封信是怎么交到我手里的。""太太，我并不好奇，什么也不想知 道。"苏菲亚大声说，"不过，我一定要求您把这封信交回原主。”
听到这话，密勒太太就跪了下来，用极感人的话语向她哀求。苏菲亚 回答说："太太，我很奇怪您对这人的事会这么关心。太太，我决不考 虑……""不，小姐，"密勒太太说，"除了事实之外，您什么也不必考虑。 我要把事实经过原原本本告诉您，然后，您也就不奇怪我为什么要关心他 啦。他是世上心肠最好的人。"然后，她就把安德生先生的那件事讲了出 来。讲完就嚷道："小姐，这就是他的善行。但是我还欠他更深的情。她救 了我的孩子……"这时，她淌着泪，又将那件事情全部告诉了苏菲亚一一只 略去有损她女儿名誉的那些细节。末了说道："好，请您评评看，小姐，对 这样仁慈、善良、慷慨的一位年轻人，我能为他尽够一点绵薄之力吗？他 确实是人类当中最善良、最可敬的一位。”
这以前，苏菲亚脸色越变越难看，显得过于苍白。可是此刻她脸上变 得简直比朱砂还要红。她大声说："我不晓得该怎么说好啦。您出于感恩而 做出的举动当然是无可责备的……不过，我读读这封信能对您的朋友有什 么好处呢，既然我已经决定永不……"密勒太太又央求起来，说这信她实在 不能再带回去，请苏菲亚原谅。"那么，太太，"苏菲亚说，"如果您非这样 做不可，我也没有办法……不管我愿意不愿意，您当然可以把信留下。"苏 菲亚这话究竟用意何在，或者有什么用意，我不便断言。可是密勒太太却 把这话理解为一个暗示，立刻就把信放在桌上，然后就告辞而去；临走的 时候，先央求苏菲亚准许她再来拜望一一这个要求既没得到首肯，也没遭 到拒绝。
那封信只在桌子上放到密勒太太的身影消失那刻为止，因为苏菲亚紧 跟着就把它拆开读了。
这封信对琼斯的事情并没帮多大忙，因为信里只不过忏悔他自己品行 如何不端，哀叹自己陷入了绝境，同时极其庄严地表示永远忠实于苏菲 亚，决不动摇。他说，如果还有见到苏菲亚的一天的话，他希望能使她相 信自己的这片忠诚。他还说，那时他可以对贝拉斯顿夫人这封信作出的解 释，纵然不能使他得到谅解，起码也会得到她的怜悯。最后，他发誓说， 他脑子里绝对没起过跟贝拉斯顿夫人结婚的念头。
尽管苏菲亚非常仔细地把这封信读了两遍，她仍然猜不透琼斯的意 思，也设想不出足以替他开脱的理由。她当然继续很生他的气一一不过， 她的气大部分都生到贝拉斯顿夫人身上去了，她那温厚的胸膛里已经没有 多少生旁人气的余地了。
最不幸的是，贝拉斯顿夫人那天要到魏斯顿女士处来吃饭，事先约好 饭后三个人一道去看歌剧，然后去赴托马斯•哈切特夫人的夜会％苏菲亚蛮 想统统都不参加，可是她又不肯开罪她姑妈；对装病的种种办法她又完全 是外行，所以脑子里从来也没想到过。因此，她一换好衣服，就下了楼， 准备经历这一天所有的恐怖一一事后也证明这是最不愉快的一天。贝拉斯 顿夫人非常狡猾而有礼貌地利用一切机会来侮辱她，苏菲亚由于精神颓 唐，一概都没回敬一一老实说，她的应对口才至多也只能说是中等的。
可怜的苏菲亚所遭受的另一个灾难是有费拉玛勋爵在场。他在歌剧院 里和苏菲亚相遇，又陪她去赴夜会。尽管这两处都是在大庭广众之中，不 容他有所放肆，同时，在歌剧院有音乐为她助兴，在夜会上有纸牌可以替
她解闷，可是有这人在场，她总是无法畅快的。女人家的感觉很微妙：当 她们知道某个男子对她们抱有野心而她们又无意满足他的野心时，只要有 那人在场，她们就连心绪也安宁不下来。
既然本章两次提到夜会（但愿后世读者不会照这里的含义来理解）， 我们就暂停一下（尽管时间很紧迫），来说明这是怎样一种消遣一一尤其 过一阵我们就要来描绘它。
那么所谓夜会，就是一簇衣着华丽的男女的社交场所，他们大部分都 玩纸牌，其余的人什么也不做。夜会的女主人则扮演客栈老板娘的角色： 尽管她不像老板娘那样总能捞到点什么，但也以宾客的众多自炫。
要使这样枯燥乏味的集会带些活泼欢快的气氛，那就需要充沛的精 力，难怪我们总是听到社交界人士抱怨精力不够；这种抱怨是只有在上流 社会才听得到的。我们可以推想这种无聊的集会此刻对苏菲亚是多么难以 忍受。当她内心正充满了深切的悲哀，每一思绪都带着痛苦煎熬的时候， 要她强颜欢笑是多么困难！
黑夜终于把她送回到床上。尽管我们担心她不能安然入睡，至少我们 要让她自去解解忧思。我们的历史将继续下去。冥冥中似乎有个声音说： 我们如今正处于一个重大事态的前夕。
第七章
奥尔华绥先生与密勒太太之间动人的一幕
奥尔华绥先生赴宴回来之后，密勒太太和他作了一番长谈。她把琼斯 不幸丢失了临离开家时乡绅所赠给他的全部财物，以及这笔损失为他带来 的苦难（所有这些情况，忠实的话匣子巴特里奇都向她作了详尽的叙述） 一一说了。然后，她又解释起自己怎样欠琼斯的情分一一关于她女儿方 面，自然她是含糊其辞的。尽管密勒太太对奥尔华绥先生是相信的，而且 这件事不幸已为半打以上的人晓得了，不大能隐瞒下去，可是她仍然无法 亲口把涉及可怜的南锡的贞操的那些情况说出来，所以密勒太太小心翼翼 地把这一段掩盖起来，真仿佛她是站在一位法官面前，而她的女儿正为了 杀害私生子罪在受审讯。
奥尔华绥先生说，很少人邪恶到一点点善心也没有的程度。"尽管这个 家伙这么坏，"他说，"我也不能否认您是欠他些情分，因此，对您为他辩 护这件事，我可以谅解；不过，我坚决要求您不再向我提起他的名字。您 可以放心，我是在有了极充分而且极显著的证据之后，才决定那么办 的。""可是先生，"她说，"我毫不怀疑时间会让一切事情显出真相来，您 终归有一天会相信这个可怜的年轻人要比一些我不愿指名的人更配受到您 的宠爱。”
"太太，"奥尔华绥带些气恼地嚷道，"我不许人在我面前指摘我外甥。 今后如果您再讲一句这种话，那么我就立刻从这儿搬出去。我那外甥是最 善良、最值得尊敬的人。我再对您说一遍，他错误地长时期替那个家伙隐 瞒最丑恶的行为，从而把友情尽得越过了应有的限度。最使我气愤的就是 这个下流东西对这个好青年的无情无义，因为，太太，我很有理由推断他 设下一个阴谋，想夺取我对我外甥的宠爱，并且剥夺他的财产继承权。”
"先生，"密勒太太回答说（她有些胆怯，因为虽然奥尔华绥先生的笑 容最慈祥和蔼不过，可是他的怒容也最是严峻可怕），"凡是您抱有好感的 人，我决不会说他的坏话。这种行为对我是很不相宜的，尤其这位又是您 的近亲。不过，先生，您可不要因为我对那个可怜虫的眷顾而生我的气， 真的，可别那样。当然，现在我可以叫他做可怜虫了，可是当年提到他 时，如果我稍稍带一些轻蔑的口气，您都会恼我的。我曾经多少次听到您 称他做您的儿子。我曾经多少次听到您用做父母的爱抚不断地向我谈到
他。先生，我甚至不能忘掉您所说的关于他的俊秀、多才和品德，关于他 的善良和慷慨的许多十分亲切的话。先生，我确实没法忘掉，因为我发现 您讲的全是实情。通过我自己的事情，我体验出来了。那些美德保全了我 们一家。先生，您别怪我流泪，您千万别见怪。当我想到这个可怜的年轻 人惨遭的变故一一而他曾经替我尽过那么多力，当我想到他已失去了您的 恩宠一一而我晓得他把那看得比生命还要宝贵，我没法不……没法不替他 悲伤。即便您手里举着短刀准备朝我的胸膛刺来，我也仍然要替您曾爱 过、我将永远爱的这个人而悲伤。”
奥尔华绥听了这番话感情很激动，然而看来他并不是在生气，因为沉 吟了一刻，他就握住密勒太太的手，很亲热地说："得啦，太太，咱们来考 虑一下令媛的事吧。您为这样一门对她有利的亲事而高兴，这是难怪的。 可是您要晓得，这种利益在很大程度上要靠她和公公和解才能享受到。我 和老耐廷盖尔先生很熟，以前同他有过往来。我打算去拜望他一下，竭力 在这件事上替您效劳。我相信他是个老于世故的人。不过，既然这是他的 独子，事情又到了木已成舟的地步，也许到一定时候可以使他想通。我一 定尽力而为。”
对于奥尔华绥这个仁厚而慷慨的建议，这位可怜的妇女多次道谢，她 也不禁借这机会再一次表示对琼斯的感激。她说："多亏他的奔走，使我如 今才能来麻烦您。"奥尔华绥温和地止住了她。不过，密勒太太当前的举动 是由一个崇高的道德观念所促使的，以奥尔华绥这样一位善良人，是决不 会真的见怪的。其实，倘若不是布利非新近向他报告的消息重新燃起他对 琼斯旧日的怒火，说不定听了密勒太太讲的琼斯这件善行会使他的心肠软 下来呢一一不管心眼怎样坏的人也不能说他这举动是出于恶意的。
奥尔华绥先生和密勒太太相聚一个多钟头，后来布利非和另外一个人 来了，打断了他们的谈话。来的不是旁人，正是律师道林先生。近来此人 非常受布利非的赏识，并且经他的推荐，当了奥尔华绥先生的大管事。布 利非还把他推荐给魏斯顿先生，这位乡绅也答应只要这一职位空出来，就 任用他。在没正式委任之前，乡绅在伦敦有一件关于抵押的事务，就先交 他办理。
这一回，道林先生主要就是为此事来到伦敦，同时，他也乘这个机会 替奥尔华绥先生办理些钱财事务，并向他报告旁的事情。这些，都过于枯
燥无味，不值得占用本书的篇幅。因此，我们和这位舅父、他的外甥和他 们的律师告辞，转来照顾一下旁的事情。
第八章
包括好几样事情
在回到琼斯先生那里之前，我们先来看看苏菲亚。
尽管如我们在前边所描述的，这位小姐用奉承的手段把她姑妈哄得高 兴，可是她一点也没能使她姑妈对费拉玛勋爵这门亲事的热情冷却下来。 这时，经贝拉斯顿夫人一煽动，她的热情又死灰复燃了。前一天晚上，贝 拉斯顿夫人告诉她说，从苏菲亚的举止以及她对勋爵的态度来看，任何迟 延都是危险的，唯一成功的办法只有尽快促成婚事，趁着苏菲亚来不及考 虑什么，迫使她糊里糊涂就表示同意。她说，在上流社会里，有一半人的 婚姻都是这么撮合起来的。这很可能是实情。我料想，许许多多幸福伉俪 婚后的你恩我爱正是亏得这种撮合。
贝拉斯顿夫人对费拉玛勋爵也作了同样的暗示。双方也都欣然接受了 这个暗示。于是，经勋爵请求，魏斯顿女士就约定苏菲亚要在第二天单独 和勋爵会见。这一决定是由魏斯顿女士通知苏菲亚的。这位姑妈话说得十 分坚决，苏菲亚想尽理由来反对也毫无效果，终于只好表现出一位年轻小 姐所能做到的最大限度的恭顺：同意去会见勋爵大人。
既然这种谈话没多大趣味，恕我们不去详细叙述这次会见的经过了。 勋爵表白了半天自己的爱情是多么纯洁、热烈，苏菲亚一直红着脸一声不 响。最后，她才鼓起所有的勇气，用低微而颤抖的声调说："爵爷，您自己 总该明白以前您对我做出的事和您眼前所表白的是不是一致。""难道我就 没法弥补自己的疯狂行为了吗？"他回答说，"我那次的行为正好可以清楚 地使您相信狂烈的爱情已经夺去了我的理智。""爵爷，”她说，"其实，您 满可以向我证明您具有一种我很愿意加以鼓励、并且会+分感念的情 意。""小姐，您说吧，"勋爵急切地说。"爵爷，"苏菲亚低头看了看她手中 的扇子说，"您总该明白您做出的这片虚情假意害得我多么不得安生。""您 能够残忍到说我的爱情是虚伪的吗？”他说。"爵爷，确是这样，"苏菲亚回 答说，"我们对自己所迫害的人表示爱情，那是带有侮辱性的虚伪。您对我 的这番追求是对我最残酷的迫害；甚至是极其卑鄙地利用我不幸的处 境。""最可爱、最可敬的美人儿，"他嚷道，"不要指责我那么卑鄙吧，我 心目中唯一想到的只是维护您的荣誉和利益。除了把我自己，我的荣衔、 财产以及所有的一切全部献给您之外，我没有旁的目的、希望或野
心。""爵爷，"她说，"我所埋怨的正是您凭着财产和荣衔来利用我不幸的 处境这一点，我的亲戚们就受到那些魅力的诱惑，可我是不稀罕这些的。 要是爵爷想受到我的感激，只有一个办法……""原谅我，神圣的人儿，"他 说，"没有可感激的。凡是我能替您做的，都是您分内应得的，为您效力将 使我感到莫大的快乐。这儿谈不上您感谢什么。皿真的，爵爷，”苏菲亚 说，"您可以得到我的感戴、我的称赞、我的好感以及我所能祝愿的一切 ――而且您可以很容易地得到它们，因为一位胸襟高尚的人是不难答应我 这个请求的。那么，让我恳求您停止这永远也不会成功的追求吧。我央求 您这么做是为了您，也为了我自己。既然您是那样高贵，想来决不会以折 磨一个不幸的女人为乐。我用自己的人格，用自己的灵魂向您发誓，不管 您把我逼到怎样困苦的地步，我也决不能一一决不肯同意这件事。那么如 果大人还非这么干下去不可，除了使您自己不痛快之外，还能有什么旁 的？"听到这里，勋爵长叹了一声，然后说："那么，小姐，难道我就如此 不幸，竟成为您所厌恶、唾弃的人？不然的话，对不起，也许您另有所爱 吧？……"说到这里，他沉吟了一下。苏菲亚带些激动地说："爵爷，我没 有必要向您说明自己为什么要这样做。您向我提出的优厚条件，我很领 情。我明白告诉您，那些既不是我应得的，也不是我所期望得到的。不 过，爵爷，当我告诉您我不能接受您所提议的这件事时，希望您别一定要 我讲出理由。"费拉玛勋爵又说了许多话，他的话我们不能完全了解，严格 说来，这也许不都是由于意思不明或语法不当。这段高调唱到最后，他 说，如果苏菲亚事先已经和一位绅士订了婚约，不管多么痛苦，从人格考 虑他也必须断了这个念头。勋爵也许把"绅士”这两个字说得格外重了些， 不然的话，我们就无法解释苏菲亚的愠怒了；她回答时，似乎对勋爵施加 于她的某种侮辱非常不满。
正当苏菲亚用比平时抬得要高的嗓音说着话的时候，魏斯顿女士走进 房间，双颊飞红，眼里冒着火。"爵爷，"她说，"您受到这样的怠慢，我真 是惭愧。您可以相信，对您的惠然光临，我们全家都是感激的；我也必须 告诉你，魏斯顿小姐，家里的人谁也没料到你会这样！"这时，勋爵替小姐 说情，可是没有用。这位姑妈一直数落到苏菲亚掏出手绢，倒在椅上大哭 起来。
底下是魏斯顿女士和勋爵的交谈，他们一直谈到勋爵告辞为止。勋爵 方面只是哀叹悲伤，魏斯顿女士则坚决向勋爵保证她侄女应当而且一定得
接受他的一切请求。"真的，爵爷，"她说，"这丫头受的教育很愚蠢，跟她 的财产以及她的门第十分不相称。我不能不说，这完全都怪她的父亲。这 丫头有着乡下人那种怕见生人的傻想法。您放心，爵爷，没有旁的，这我 可以用人格向您担保。我相信她的智力实际是好的，一定可以说服过来 的。”
最后这段话是背着苏菲亚说的，因为在那以前，她已经带着从没有过 的怒容走出房间去了。这时，勋爵向魏斯顿女士一再道谢，一再表示他对 苏菲亚的爱情是动摇不了的，又一再保证一定坚持到底，受到魏斯顿女士 的极大鼓励之后，才告别而去。
在叙述魏斯顿女士和苏菲亚之间的谈话之前，最好提一提早先不幸发 生的一件事，也正是由于这件事，魏斯顿女士才那么气冲冲地回到苏菲亚 身边。
读者要晓得，当前伺候苏菲亚的那个女仆是贝拉斯顿夫人举荐来的。 这女仆曾在夫人家里当过一阵梳头娘。她为人机警，夫人曾嘱她一定要+ 分仔细地监视小姐。说来很遗憾：这道命令还是由昂诺尔大姐转达的。那 位大姐现在颇得夫人的宠爱，她对新主人的忠诚早已使得她以前对苏菲亚 的一片深厚感情荡然无存了。
密勒太太走了以后，贝蒂（这就是那个女仆的名字）回到苏菲亚身 边，看见小姐正在聚精会神地读着一封长信。小姐脸上那显而易见的激动 神情本就足以印证那女仆所起的某种怀疑，可是贝蒂另外还有更确凿的根 据：她偷听了苏菲亚和密勒太太之间的全部谈话。
贝蒂就把这一切全报告了魏斯顿女士。为了这番忠诚，她得到了女主 人的夸奖和酬劳；并且得到吩咐说，如果那个妇人再送信来，就带她直接 来见魏斯顿女士。
不幸，就在苏菲亚会见勋爵的时候，密勒太太又来了。贝蒂就按照女 主人的吩咐，径直把她引到这位姑妈跟前。魏斯顿女士心里既然对头天的 一切情况了如指掌，所以不难骗得那个可怜的妇人相信苏菲亚已经招认出 全部事实，这样，也就把密勒太太所晓得的关于那封信的内容以及琼斯的 情况统统套出来了。
密勒太太真可以说是老实的化身。她属于人家说什么就信什么的那种 人，对这种人，造物既没赋予攻势的欺骗手段，也没赋予为了防御而用的 欺骗手段。因此，任何人只要肯于略施诈术，都可以把她骗住。魏斯顿女
士在把密勒太太所晓得的一切（其实并不很多，但却足以引起这位姑妈的 种种猜疑）都挤干净之后，就把她打发走，说苏菲亚一定不会见她的，同 时，她不会写回信，也不要再收什么信。密勒太太离开之前，魏斯顿女士 还狠狠地教训了她一顿，说她所干的勾当只能叫作拉皮条。这个发现使得 她激愤起来。这时，她走进隔壁房间，听到苏菲亚正激动地斥拒勋爵的求 婚。已经燃起的怒火这下子爆发了，她就闯了进去，暴跳如雷地责骂起她 的侄女一一这些，直到勋爵辞别时的情景，我们前边已经描绘过了。
费拉玛勋爵刚走，魏斯顿女士就来到苏菲亚跟前，厉声责备她不该辜 负对她表示的信任，竟然背信弃义去跟她前一天刚刚郑重宣誓永远割断关 系的那人又重新往来了。苏菲亚否认有什么往来。"哦，怎么，魏斯顿小 姐！”这位姑妈说，"你能否认昨天收到过他一封信吗？""一封信，姑 姑！”苏菲亚感到有些意外，回答说。"重复长辈的话是没礼貌的，小 姐，"她姑妈说，"我说一封信，而且我要你马上拿给我看。""姑姑，我讨 厌撒谎，"苏菲亚说，"我确实接到过一封信，然而这信并不是应我的要求 而写的――甚至可以说，是违背我的意思写来的。""说得倒好，小姐，"她 姑妈嚷道，"仅仅为了承认收到过这封信，你就应该羞愧！可是信呢？我要 看。"
听到这个断然的要求，苏菲亚沉吟了一刻才作答，终于也只是推辞 说，信不在她衣袋里一一这倒真是实情。她姑妈这下按捺不住了，就干脆 问她究竟打不打算嫁给费拉玛勋爵。苏菲亚很坚决地给了个否定的答复。 魏斯顿女士赌了个咒（或者说了一句很像赌咒的话），声言第二天一大早 就把她交回她的父亲。
于是，苏菲亚就这样来劝说她的姑妈："喏，难道我非嫁个人不可吗， 姑姑？要是您也像我这样，您该认为有多么残忍啊。您的父母对您完全不 加干涉，他们有多么仁慈啊。我犯了什么过错，使我非放弃这份自由不可 呢？在没得到我爹的同意，以及您的同意之前，我决不嫁给任何人……如 果我请求你们两位同意我嫁给一个不相宜的人，那时你们再强迫我嫁给旁 人也不晚呀！""衣袋里现在就揣着一封杀人犯写来的信，”魏斯顿女士嚷 道，"这样的丫头还跑来跟我说这种话，我能听得下去吗？""我确实告诉 您，”苏菲亚回答说，"我并没有这样的信。而且，如果他真是个杀人犯的 话，那么很快他也就不可能再叫您操心了。"“哦，魏斯顿小姐，"她姑妈 说，"你居然敢用这种口气谈到他，当着我面就承认你对这个坏蛋的爱
情！""姑姑，”苏菲亚说，"您显然把我的话解释得很奇怪。""老实说，魏 斯顿小姐，"她姑妈嚷道，"我不能忍受你这种态度。你对我的这种态度是 跟你老子学的。他教你跟我顶嘴，用他那套愚蠢的教育方法把你完全教育 坏了。如今，谢天谢地，让他自食其果吧。我再向你宣布一次，明天一早 我就送你回去。我要完全从战场上撤退，今后就像那明智的普鲁士王一 样，严守中立。你和你老子都太聪明啦，我管不了。请准备停当吧，明天 一早你就得离开这里。”
苏菲亚竭力申辩，可是她姑妈一概置之不理。既然没有希望使魏斯顿 女士回心转意，我们目前只好让她这么坚决下去。
第九章
琼斯先生在狱中的遭遇
在耐廷盖尔先生返回之前，琼斯先生在忧郁中度过了二十四小时，只 有巴特里奇来陪陪他。这位可敬的青年并没有丢弃或忘却他的朋友。实际 上，他绝大部分时间都在为琼斯的事奔走。
经过访查，他听说唯一亲眼看到琼斯和费兹帕特利那场不幸的斗殴 的，是停在德特福［6］的一条兵舰上的几个水手。于是，他就跑到德特福去寻 找那几个水手。到那里，又听说他找的那几个人全上了岸。他就到处找， 最后，看到两名水手正同一个第三者在阿尔德斯盖特［刀一家小酒店里一道喝 酒。
耐廷盖尔要求和琼斯本人单独谈一谈一一他进来的时候，巴特里奇正 在屋里。巴特里奇走开之后，耐廷盖尔就挽住琼斯的手嚷道："喏，勇敢的 朋友，听了下面我告诉你的话，你可不要垂头丧气……很抱歉，竟由我来 带给你这样的坏消息。可是我认为我有责任让你晓得。""我已经猜出是什 么了，"琼斯嚷道，"这么说来，那位可怜的先生已经死啦。""但愿他还没 死，"耐廷盖尔回答说，"今天早晨他还活着哪。不过，我也不愿叫你存过 高的希望……从我所听到的情况看，他受的伤是致命的。但是如果事情确 是像你所说的那样，那么一切随它去吧，你只要问心无愧就得了。不过， 请原谅我，亲爱的汤姆，我恳求你把最坏的情况告诉你的朋友们。要是你 对我们隐瞒什么，那只有对你自己不利。”
“亲爱的杰克，”琼斯说，"我怎么会引起你用这种怀疑来刺痛我 呢别发急，"耐廷盖尔嚷道，"我原原本本告诉你。经过多方打听，我 终于找到了目睹这场不幸事件的那两个家伙。可惜，他们所谈的经过并不 如你谈的那么对你自己有利。""那么他们怎么说的？"琼斯嚷道。"重复他 们的话我实在感到很难过，因为我怕对你有不利的后果。那两个人说，他 们站得太远，没听到你们说了些什么；可是两个异口同声说是你先动的 手。皿那么，平心而论，”琼斯回答说，"他们冤枉了我。他不但先打的 我，并且是无缘无故打的。这两个坏蛋为什么要讲这种谎话来害我 呢这我就猜不透啦，"耐廷盖尔说，"如果你自己，以及我一一你的知 心朋友，尚且想不出他们为什么要诬陷你，那么跟你不沾亲不带故的法官 又有什么理由不相信这两个人的话？我一连问了好几遍，在场的另外那位
先生也问了几遍一一我相信那是个海员，他确实想帮你说话，因为他一再 央求那两人记住，他们的证词是关系到一个人的性命的。他反复地问他们 确不确凿。他们回答说，半点不假，并且甘愿宣誓作证。亲爱的朋友，你 千万要镇定。事情要真是这样的话，你得尽量及早替自己的权益想想。我 不想吓唬你，可是我相信你晓得法律是多么严酷无情：不管对方口头上怎 样向你挑衅，也不能成为你动手的借口。""唉，朋友，"琼斯嚷道，"我这 可怜虫，还有什么权益可想？而且，既然背上了杀人犯的恶名，你以为我 还愿意活下去吗？要是我有朋友（唉！我没有哇），我怎么能有勇气去请 他们为一个被判犯了最灭绝人性的罪行的人来说话呢？请你相信，我不抱 这种希望。但是我对天国的主宰持有一定的信心，他一定会赐我以一切应 得的保护。”
最后，琼斯发了许多庄重的誓言，坚持他最初讲的全是实情。
这么一来，耐廷盖尔又不那么相信自己听到的话了，觉得还是朋友讲 的可靠。这时，密勒太太来了，她悲痛地讲了一下奔走的经过。琼斯听了 之后，极其豪迈地说："喏，朋友，如今不管发生什么事，对我都无所谓了 ――至少不再稀罕我这条命。如果上帝的意旨是要我杀人偿命的话，我希 望他总有一天替我雪耻伸冤；但愿上帝至少肯于听一个临死的人所说的 话，以便洗刷他人格上蒙受的污点。”
于是，如今在囚犯和他的朋友之间展开了非常悲惨的一幕。既然很少 读者乐于参与这样一个场面，我相信也不会有多少人希望我来详细描绘。 所以我们就跳过这一段。这时，狱卒进来告诉琼斯说，如果他得空的话， 外面有一位女客求见。
琼斯听了表示很诧异。他说他万也想不起会有什么女人到这个地方来 看他。不过，他也没理由拒绝会见谁。这时，密勒太太和耐廷盖尔先生就 告辞了。琼斯吩咐把那位女客请进来。
如果刚才琼斯听说有位女客来看他而感到诧异，那么如今看到来的不 是旁人一一正是沃特尔太太，他该感到多么惊奇啊！我们先让琼斯去吃一 会儿惊去吧，好腾下手来为读者解一解谜一一想来读者也必为这位太太的 到来而吃惊不小。
这位沃特尔太太是何许人，读者是很清楚的。她的来历，读者也一定 完全晓得。所以请读者回想一下这位太太从厄普顿镇动身时，她是跟费兹
帕特利先生以及另一位爱尔兰绅士同乘一辆马车，在他们的陪伴下，去的 巴思。
这时，费兹帕特利先生名下有个职位刚好出了缺一一就是说，妻子这 个位子，因为原来担任这一职位的那位太太最近辞了职，或者至少是放弃 了职守。费兹帕特利先生路上从头到脚仔细端详了沃特尔太太，发现她很 适宜补上这个缺。于是，一到巴思，他就把这一职务委派给她，她也毫不 顾忌地承受下来了。在巴思的全部时间，他们一直作为夫妻住在一起，如 今，又作为夫妻来到了京城。
究竟是费兹帕特利先生为人精明，在拿回原有的宝物（对于收复宝 物，目前他只能抱有一线希望）之前，他绝不放弃手中的宝物呢，还是沃 特尔太太把这个职务干得如此出色，以致费兹帕特利先生想把她扶正，让 他的妻子当副的（事情往往是这样）呢，我不便断言；不过，可以肯定的 是他从没向沃特尔太太提过他的妻子，从来没告诉过她魏斯顿女士交给他 的那封信，也从没暗示过他想找回自己的妻子，更不曾提过琼斯的名字。 尽管他打算一碰到琼斯就跟他决斗，然而他并不想仿效那些谨慎持重的 人，他们认为举行决斗时，妻子、母亲、姊妹或者有时甚至全家，是最可 靠的助手。所以直到他在那家小酒店包扎上伤口被抬回家来后，沃特尔太 太才初次从他口中听到事情的经过。
费兹帕特利先生从来也不善于把事情叙述得一清二楚，如今讲得也许 比平时更含糊一些。过了一阵子她才发现在费兹帕特利先生身上留下这道 创伤的人，原来就是曾经在她心上留下创伤的那位先生，这一创伤虽然不 会致命，但扎得却很深，疤痕因而也相当大。不过她一听说因杀人嫌疑而 被关进牢里的就是琼斯先生本人，她一有机会就把费兹帕特利先生交给他 的护士，自己赶忙跑去看那位胜利者。
这时，她带着轻快的神情进了牢房，可是她这份轻快在可怜的琼斯那 副忧容面前立刻煞住了。他一望到沃特尔太太就吃了一惊，在胸前画了个 +字。于是她说："我对您的吃惊并不感到奇怪。我相信您决没料到我会 来，因为在这种地方，除了做妻子的，是难得会有旁的女人来打扰的。琼 斯先生，这就足见您对我有多么大的魔力了。老实说，咱们在厄普顿分手 的时候，我没想到咱们会在这么个地方重逢。""真的，太太，”琼斯 说，"我不能不感念您这番好心，因为很少有人肯探望一个在患难中的人， 尤其不会到这么凄凄惨惨的地方。""琼斯先生，"她说，"我简直没法相信
您就是我在厄普顿见到的那个可爱的小伙子啦。唉，您的脸比天地间任何 一座地牢还要悲惨。您究竟怎么啦？""太太，"琼斯说，"我原以为您既然 晓得我在这儿，当然也晓得我被关到这儿的原因了。""嗨！”她说，"您也 不过是在决斗中刺伤了个人呗。"琼斯对她这种轻松感到有些气恼。他用十 分悔恨的心情谈起已经发生的事。她回答说："喏，先生，既然您心里那么 着急，我就叫您宽怀吧。那位先生并没有死，而且我确信他也没有性命之 忧。那个最初替他包扎的外科大夫是个年轻小伙子，看来他是想尽量把伤 势说得严重一些，医好之后好增加自己的声望。可是后来经王家外科大夫 诊治，他说，除非病者发烧，否则没有丝毫生命危险一一目前他没有发烧 的征象。”琼斯听到这一消息，喜形于色。沃特尔太太又进一步证实 说："非常凑巧，我和那位病者住在同一个住所里，我已经见过他。我可以 保证，他替您说了公道话。他说：不论这件事情的结果怎样，总是他自己 先动手的，你没有丝毫错处。”
琼斯对沃特尔太太带给他的情况，表示十分满意。然后，他又告诉沃 特尔太太许多她早已晓得了的事，诸如费兹帕特利先生是什么人，以及怨 恨是怎样引起的等等。他还告诉这位太太一些她所不晓得的事，像手笼的 来历以及其他细节一一只不过没提苏菲亚的名字。然后，他又痛悔自己过 去所做的种种愚蠢和罪恶的勾当。他还说，每一件行为都为他带来恶果， 如果他不知警惕，今后改邪归正，那可真是不可饶恕的了。最后，他向沃 特尔太太保证，决不再干坏事，以免遭到更大的不幸。
沃特尔太太十分愉快地跟他打趣，说他这番话都是由于坐牢和颓丧的 心情所造成的。她重述一些有关魔鬼生病的俏皮话给他听，并且告诉他 说，她深信不久他就可以重获自由，仍然成为过去那样生气勃勃的小伙 子。"那时候，"她说，"我相信您就会从目前如此不快地郁结起来的悔恨心 情中安然摆脱出来。”
她还讲了许多类似的话，有一些如果旧话重提，在部分读者看来，对 她未必十分光彩。至于琼斯所作的回答，我们也不能断言旁的读者不会加 以讥笑。因此，我们就把他们二人这次谈话的其余部分删略了，仅仅指出 他们的谈话是在完全清白无邪的情况下结束的一一对这一点，琼斯要比那 位太太满意多了。因为琼斯听到她带来的消息，欣喜若狂，而沃特尔太太 对琼斯的改邪归正并不怎么感到惬意；原来她和他初次相识时，对他另有 看法，和现在很不相同。
这样，耐廷盖尔先生的报告所引起的忧愁之感差不多已经一扫而光 了，可是他还没能从密勒太太使他陷入的苦恼中自拔出来。她的叙述和苏 菲亚信上的话完全吻合，因而他毫不怀疑苏菲亚已经把他在信里写的内容 全透露给她姑妈，并且下定决心抛弃他了。这一思绪所给予他的折磨，只 有命运为他保留下的另一个消息可以相比。消息为何？容我们在下一卷的 第二章里再告诉读者。

六天里的事
第一章
与读者告别
读者诸君，咱们现在到达这趟长途旅行的最后一个阶段了。既然在这 么长的篇幅中结为旅伴，那么咱们就像同乘一辆驿车、共度过几天的旅伴 那样来相处吧。这些旅伴尽管路上彼此之间可能发生过一些口角或小小的 龃龉，终究会完全和解，最后一次愉快而随和地跨进车子；因为在这段驿 程之后，我们也许就将和车上的旅伴一样永远不再相逢了。
既然这里使用了驿车这个比喻，那么就允许我再用一阵吧。在这最后 一卷书里，我打算仿效上述那些走最后一段驿程的好旅伴们。众所周知， 这时际，一切戏谑打趣自然都要抛到一边。任何旅客为了开玩笑而在路上 扮演的角色也得就此撇开。话题通常是平淡无奇，一本正经的。
同样，倘若我在本书进程中，为了使读者开怀解颐，不时开一些玩 笑，现在我也把那些放下了。我必须把许许多多事情塞进这一卷里，实在 没地方来容纳我在其他各卷里所发的那些带有诙谐意味的议论一一每当您 昏昏欲睡的时候，也许正是它们使您没能打起瞌睡。在这最后一卷里，您 将找不到（或者极少遇到）这类东西。本卷只是简单明了的叙述。说实在 的，您读完这一卷里所包含的许许多多重大事件之后，就会认为这几十页 篇幅几乎不够叙述故事的。
现在，我的朋友，我就利用这个机会（因为没有旁的机会了）诚恳地 向您致意。倘若我曾经是您的一位富有风趣的旅伴，请相信，那正合我的 心愿。倘有冒犯之处，我也绝不是有意的。我笔下容或有开罪您或尊友的 地方，我在此郑重声明，那绝不是针对您或尊友的。毫无疑问，在关于我 的一些风言风语里，您一定还听说，与您结伴而行的是个满口下流话的家 伙。不管谁这么说，都是对我的中伤。没有人比我更憎恨和蔑视下流话的 了，也没有人比我更有理由抱这种态度，因为谁遭到的污蔑都没有我多。 更不幸的是，有些谩骂的文章竟被当作是我写的，而正是这些文章的作者 本人却又在另外一些文章里用最刻毒的话来骂我。
不过，我深信远在您读到此页之前，这些文章就早已湮没无闻了。我 自己的作品寿命再短促，它也很可能比其体弱多病的作者，以及那些专喜 毁谤的同辈人笔下虚弱无力的产品要活得长久。
第二章
一件十分悲惨的事
在上一卷里，我们看到琼斯陷入恼人的沉思中。正当他为忧思愁绪这 样煎煞着时，巴特里奇带着比灰烬还要苍白的脸色，踉踉跄跄地闯了进 来。他两眼发直，头发倒竖，四肢一齐颤抖着。一句话，他活像见了鬼， 要不，他自己就是个鬼。
琼斯平时难得害怕，可是见了巴特里奇这样突然出现，不免也有些吃 惊。他自己的脸色也变了，当他盘问究竟出了什么事的时候，也有些结结 巴巴的。
"先生，"巴特里奇说，"您可别生我的气。我并没偷听，可是我必得呆 在外头那间房里。我敢说，我宁愿呆在一百哩以外，也不愿听到我所听到 的话。皿啊，到底什么事呀？"琼斯说。"什么事？”巴特里奇说，"哎，先 生，天哪，刚才走出去的那个女人就是在厄普顿镇上跟您在一起的那个女 人吗是呀，巴特里奇，"琼斯嚷道。"先生，您真的跟那个女人一道睡 过觉吗？”他战战兢兢地问。"我们之间那段关系恐怕再也瞒不住人了，"琼 斯说。"不，先生，看在老天的面上，请您直截了当地告诉我吧，"巴特里 奇嚷道。"你晓得是有那么回事，"琼斯大声说。"咳，那么求上帝保佑您， 并且赦免您吧，"巴特里奇叫道，"这件事就像我活生生地站在这里一样真 切：您同您自己的生母睡了觉了。”
听到这番话，一刹那间琼斯变成了一幅恐怖之图，比巴特里奇更加可 怕。他好一阵子吓得说不出话来，两人目瞪口呆地面面相觑着。最后，琼 斯才挣扎着张开口，断断续续地说："怎么，怎么，你说的是什么？""唉， 先生，"巴特里奇叫道，"我连告诉您的力气也没有啦，但是我说的话是千 真万确的。刚才走出去的那个女人是您的生母。您真倒霉，在厄普顿的时 候我没瞅见她，不然的话我就可以不让这件事发生了。这个罪孽一定是魔 鬼亲手布置下的。”
"看来命运不把我逼疯了是决不肯罢休的，"琼斯嚷道，"可是我为什么 要责怪命运呢！一切灾难都是我自己招来的。所有降在我身上的这些横祸 都只是我自己的愚蠢、堕落行为的下场。巴特里奇，你所告诉我的事简直 把我吓昏过去了。难道沃特尔太太就是……唉，何必还问呢！你一定认得 她。如果你真的爱我，不，真的可怜我，那么我恳求你替我把这个不幸的
女人找回来。啊，天哪，乱伦一一跟自己的生母！我还有什么活头儿 呢？”然后，他就在忧愁和绝望下，陷入最剧烈而凄惶的苦痛中。巴特里奇 说，他不能在这样的情况下走开。琼斯这么呼天抢地抒发了自己的激情之 后，最后稍微镇定下来了。于是，他打发巴特里奇去找那个不幸的女人， 说她和那位受伤的绅士住在同一所房子里。
倘若读者把第九卷里厄普顿那一场追忆一下，他就会感到吃惊：尽管 沃特尔太太和琼斯先生共度了一个整天，不幸，许许多多离奇的小事却使 得巴特里奇始终没能和她碰一下头。生活中这类例子是常见的：巨大事件 是由一连串细微情节产生出来的。明察秋毫的读者可以在本书中发现的例 子决不止这一个。
巴特里奇白白找了两三个钟头，也没见到沃特尔太太。由于他迟迟不 回来，琼斯等得几乎绝望了 ；及至听到他的回报，又急得差不多发了疯。 不过，没多久他就收到了下面这封信：
先生：
别后我见到一位先生，他告诉我关于您的一些情况，大大出我意料之外，使我不胜惊 讶。但目前我无暇跑来告诉您这一重大事实，您只好暂时按捺住自己的好奇心，以待我们下次 的会晤。我一抽得出身，当即趋前探望。啊，琼斯先生，当我在厄普顿与您欢度那一天的时候 （那一日幸福的回忆势将使我全部未来的生活黯然失色），我丝毫也没想到那份至高的幸福是 什么人给予我的。
请相信，我是您的不幸的 琼■沃特尔
再者：请您尽管放心，费兹帕特利先生并无任何生命危险。所以不管您有什么其他需要 忏悔的严重罪过，杀人一项却不在其中。
琼斯读完这封信，握不住它，就任它落在地上了。老实说，他的官能 几乎都不听他使唤了。巴特里奇把它拾起来，得到琼斯的默许以后，也看 了一遍，他受到的震动也不小。他们脸上呈现的恐怖只能用铅笔而不能用 钢笔来描绘。两人正相对无言的当儿，狱卒进来了。他并没怎么理会到两
人脸上的表情。他告诉琼斯说，外面有个人想和他谈谈。随后，就把那人 引进来一一原来正是黑乔治。
乔治不像狱卒那样看惯了恐怖的神情，他立即发觉琼斯脸上显得十分 不安的样子。他认定必是由于那次决斗的事，有人从最坏的角度把那件事 报知了魏斯顿家。因此，乔治断定那位绅士必是已经因伤致命，琼斯先生 不体面的末日也将到来。这个念头使得他老大的不舒服，因为乔治生性富 于同情心，尽管过去由于贪图财物而干了小小一件不义的事，可是整个说 来，他并没忘记琼斯先生旧日对他的情分。
所以这个可怜的家伙见到此情此景，不禁潸然泪下。他告诉琼斯说， 他衷心为琼斯所遭受的不幸而难过，并且问他自己有什么可效劳的地方没 有。"先生，"他说，"也许此刻您需要点儿钱。要是这样的话，先生，我非 常愿意把我所有的一点钱交您任意使用。”
琼斯诚恳地和他握了握手，对他这番好意一再表示感激，可是回答 说，他根本不缺钱。乔治听了，更加热切地表示愿意帮忙。琼斯再一次感 谢了他，向他保证，他并不需要任何世人所能给的帮助。"唉，唉，我的好 主人，"乔治说，"别把这件事太缠在心上。事情的结果也许比您设想的要 好。像您这样杀了人而没事的，有的是。""乔治，”巴特里奇说，"你这话 走了题啦。那位绅士并没死，也不像会死的。眼下先别打搅主人吧，他正 为一件事难过哪一一这件事你是帮不上什么忙的。”"巴特里奇先生，"乔治 说，"你不晓得我能帮什么忙。要是他为我家小姐的事着急的话，我倒有点 儿消息可以禀告他。""乔治先生，你说什么？"琼斯嚷道，"我的苏菲亚最 近怎样了？啊，我的苏菲亚！像我这么个倒霉鬼，怎么配如此不敬地提到 她的名字！""我倒还盼着她将是您的人哩，"乔治回答说，"对了，先生， 有点儿关于她的消息可以告诉您。魏斯顿姑姑刚刚把苏菲亚小姐送了回 来，这下简直闹翻了天。我搞不清闹的是些什么名堂。可是老爷发了一大 通脾气，魏斯顿姑姑也发了一通脾气。她走出门外上轿子的时候，我听到 她说，以后永远也不再登老爷的门了。我也闹不清是怎么回事。不过我出 来的时候，又都平静下来了。可是伺候开晚饭的罗宾说，他许久以来没见 到老爷和小姐这么融洽相处了。他吻了小姐好几遍，赌咒发誓一定让她完 全自由，再也不把她关起来。我想您必然高兴听到这个消息，所以尽管天 已经很晚了，我还是溜了出来告诉您一下。"琼斯先生诚恳地对乔治说，他
听了确实十分高兴。他还说，尽管他再也不配仰首瞻望这位完美无比的人 儿，可是再也没有比听到她一切平安、顺利更能减轻他的痛苦的了。
这次晤谈的其余部分不甚重要，我们就不多费笔墨了。读者想必会原 谅我们不再讲述下去，大家一定乐于知道乡绅如何对女儿又那么抚爱备至 的。
魏斯顿女士一来到她哥哥的寓所，就讲起和费拉玛勋爵结亲将为魏斯 顿家族增多大光荣，会带来多大好处，可是她侄女竟然怎么也不肯答应这 门亲事。乡绅站在女儿一边，也拒绝这门亲事。做姑妈的立刻勃然大怒。 这样一来，她把乡绅惹急了。他再也按捺不住，再也顾不得后果了。于 是，兄妹之间发生了一场口角，连比灵大邙］那一带的喧哗也远远比不上。 魏斯顿女士是在相互诟骂得正激烈时离去的，所以也没来得及把苏菲亚收 到信的事告诉她哥哥一一倘若告诉了，很可能会引起不利于苏菲亚的后 果。不过，说实话，我相信她当时早把这件事忘干净了。
-方面由于必要，一方面也由于她个人的性格，苏菲亚一直也没开 口。等她姑妈走后，苏菲亚才站在父亲这边反对她姑妈，借以酬答她父亲 站在她这边来反对她姑妈的好意。这么做在她还是初次，乡绅自然非常满 意。他又记起奥尔华绥先生曾经表示坚决不许使用暴力来促成这门亲事。 既然他深信琼斯必然会上绞刑架，他就毫不怀疑用温和的办法也一定可以 在他女儿的亲事上如愿以偿。因此，他再一次听任天性中的爱女之情自自 然然流露出来，感动了苏菲亚那颗孝顺的、知恩的、温柔而情深意厚的 心，倘若她对琼斯作下的诺言也许还有关于琼斯的其他一些什么消除了的 话，我想她很可能为了顺从她父亲就牺牲自己，嫁给那个她所不喜欢的人 了。她答应她父亲，她一辈子所要做的就是报答他，决不嫁给一个乡绅所 不同意的人。这一下喜得老人几乎到达了幸福的顶峰。他决定采取另一步 骤，然后喝个酩酊大醉，倒头大睡。
第三章
奥尔华绥先生走访老耐廷盖尔;顺便有一个离奇的发现
就在这些事情发生之后的第二天早晨，奥尔华绥先生按照他所许诺 的，拜访老耐廷盖尔去了。他在老耐廷盖尔眼里威望如此之高，谈了三个 钟头，老耐廷盖尔终于在奥尔华绥先生的怂恿之下，同意去看望他的儿 子。
在这里，发生了一件十分不平凡的事，善良而严肃的人从这类事中得 出结论：无论坏人在罪恶的邪途上走得多么诡秘，造物也往往把最隐蔽的 恶行揭露出来，以便忠告世人不可背弃诚实的道路。
奥尔华绥先生一走进耐廷盖尔先生家里就看到黑乔治。他并没理睬 他，黑乔治也没料到乡绅会注意到自己。
可是等他们谈完主要的问题以后，奥尔华绥就问耐廷盖尔可认得一个 叫乔治•西格里姆的，并且问起那人到他家来有什么事。"认识啊，"耐廷盖 尔回答说，"我对他很熟悉，真是个了不起的家伙。他租了一块很小的田 产，每年进项三+镑，如今居然攒了五百镑。皿这件事是他告诉您的 吗？”奥尔华绥大声说。"放心，这一点儿也不假，"耐廷盖尔说，"因为钱 此刻全在我手里哪，是五张票子；我打算把它贷出去或者用它在北英格兰 置点田产。"在奥尔华绥的要求下，他把钱票拿出来了。奥尔华绥一看，立 刻在胸前画了个十字，说这个发现可真离奇。这时，他就告诉耐廷盖尔 说，这钞票本来是他的，然后就讲了全部经过。正像没有比强盗、赌棍和 此类窃贼更抱怨商业上的欺诈行为的，也没有比放高利贷的、经纪人和此 类窃贼更痛斥赌棍等等的欺诈行为的了。究竟是这种欺诈揭那种欺诈的 底，叫它出丑呢，还是金钱（各种欺诈行为所共同追逐的情妇）驱使它们 相互势不两立起来呢，则不敢说。总之，耐廷盖尔一听到这段经过，立刻 破口大骂黑乔治，用的字眼儿要比公道、正直的奥尔华绥厉害得多。
奥尔华绥要耐廷盖尔把这笔钱以及这个秘密都保留起来；在听到进一 步通知之前，不可采取任何行动。倘若在这期间他见到那个家伙，千万不 要让他晓得他已有所察觉。然后他就回到寓所，看到密勒太太由于听到她 女婿告诉她的事正在十分沮丧。奥尔华绥先生兴高采烈地说，他带来了非 常好的消息。然后，就直截了当地告诉她说，他已经把老耐廷盖尔先生说 服，同意来看他的儿子了。奥尔华绥先生表示尽管他发现老先生由于自己
家里发生了类似的一件事而苦恼得很，他仍然相信可以让父子俩完全和 解。随后，他提到老耐廷盖尔的侄女跟人逃跑了一一这是老先生告诉奥尔 华绥的，密勒太太和她的女婿当时还不晓得。
读者大概以为密勒太太得到这个消息会非常感激，并且非常高兴。但 是她对琼斯的情谊远非寻常可比，所以我不敢说她为琼斯而感到的焦急会 不会盖过她听到这桩有关她自己全家幸福的消息时所感到的快乐。甚至那 个好消息本身会不会既使她高兴，又使她难过呢，因为它又令她想起自己 欠琼斯的情分。这时，她那颗感恩的心对她说："如今，我的一家都幸福 了，可是这份幸福的开端完全是他的慷慨行为所赐予的一一这个不幸者现 在是处于怎样痛苦的境地啊！”
奥尔华绥先生容她一些时间去咀嚼（如果可以这么说的话）这头一个 好消息的滋味，说他还有些事要告诉她，相信她听了一定会很开心。他 说："我发现了一笔属于您的那位年轻朋友的款子，数目很可观。不过，他 眼下这种状况也许用不着了。"从这段话的后一半，密勒太太猜出他指的是 谁了。她叹了口气，回答说："但愿不会这样，先生。""我也衷心这样希 望，，，奥尔华绥大声说，"不过，我的外甥今天早晨告诉我说，关于这件事 他听到一个很坏的消息。皿哎呀，先生，”她说，"自然，我是不应开口 的，可是当我听到这样的话，还非闭上嘴不可，那确实很不容易。皿太 太，"奥尔华绥说，"您想讲什么都请您尽管讲，您总了解我，决不至于以 为我会对任何人存偏见。至于那个年轻人，我衷心希望他的一切罪名全得 到免除一一尤其在这件不幸的案件上。您亲眼看到我以前是多么疼爱他 的。我晓得世人正是为了我对他的这种爱抚而责怪我。要不是有充分的理 由，我也决不会收回我对他的钟爱。密勒太太，请您相信，要是我能发现 自己判断错误了，我只会高兴的。”密勒太太刚要急着回答，进来一个仆 人，对她说外面有一位先生想马上跟她谈谈。奥尔华绥先生就问起他的外 甥，仆人回禀说，他跟常来看他的那位先生在房里谈了好长一阵子了。奥 尔华绥先生猜出那是道林先生，要立刻同他谈话。
道林先生来见他了。奥尔华绥就把钞票的事对他讲了，只没提是谁干 的，问他这种人应受到怎样的惩罚。道林回答说，他认为这人应按"黑法 令"⑵办理。不过，他说这个案件很微妙，还是应当提交律师公会去解决。 他说，他刚好就要为魏斯顿家的一件事去出席律师公会，如果奥尔华绥先 生愿意的话，他可以把这案件也提出来。奥尔华绥表示了同意。随后，密
勒太太推开了门。她说："哦，对不起，我不晓得您有客人。"可是奥尔华 绥把她让了进来，说事情已经办完了。这时，道林先生就告辞出去。密勒 太太介绍小耐廷盖尔先生来见奥尔华绥先生，感谢他代为奔走的隆情厚 意。可是她没等这位年轻绅士说完，就打断他的话道："啊，先生，耐廷盖 尔先生带来了关于可怜的琼斯先生的大好消息。他刚去看过那个受伤的绅 士，那人已经完全脱离险境；更重要的是，那人声明是他自己先动手打可 怜的琼斯先生的。先生，您当然不愿意琼斯先生做一个胆小鬼。我要是个 男人，谁动手打我，我也一定拔刀还击的。亲爱的，你自己把这一切情况 全告诉奥尔华绥先生吧。"于是耐廷盖尔就证实了密勒太太所说的一切，最 后还讲了琼斯的许多好话，说他是世上脾气再好不过的人，一点也不喜欢 同人吵架。耐廷盖尔刚要住口，密勒太太又要他把从琼斯口里听到的许多 感戴奥尔华绥先生的话，统统讲出来。"说奥尔华绥先生是以高恩厚德待 他，那只是他理应做的，"耐廷盖尔大声说，"算不得什么功绩。然而我必 须说，没有人比可怜的琼斯更念念不忘一位好人的恩情。老实说，先生， 我深信压在他身上最重的负担，就是您对他的气恼。他时常为这件事向我 表示难过，也时常极庄重地对我说，他从没有意冒犯过您一一他甚至发誓 说，他宁愿死一千次，也不愿对您有一点点不敬、不义或不孝的念头，使 良心受到呵责。不过，请您原谅，这是个外人不便插嘴的问题，恐怕我已 经太冒失了。皿你只是说了一个基督教徒该说的话罢了，”密勒太太嚷 道。"真的，耐廷盖尔先生，"奥尔华绥回答说，"您这种深厚的友谊是很值 得称许的，但愿您这些话他能当之无愧。我承认，我很高兴听到您从那位 受伤的绅士那里带来的消息。事情如果真像您所说的（其实我丝毫不怀疑 您所说的），这也许会使我渐渐改变我近来对这个年轻人的看法。这位好 心的太太以及所有认识我的人都可以证明，我爱他就和自己亲生的儿子一 个样。我确实把他看作命运注定要我来哺育的孩子。我依然记得当我最初 发现他时，他那种天真烂漫、孤苦伶仃的情景。当时，我还感觉到他的小 手轻轻攥住我。他曾经是我的宝贝，确实是这样。"说到这里他停住了，眼 眶里含满了泪水。
由于密勒太太回答的话可能将我们引到新的事情上面去，我们就在这 里停住，先来说明一下奥尔华绥先生的心情上所起的显著变化，以及他对 琼斯的怒气是怎么减弱的。诚然，这种巨变在小说里和戏剧里确实时常出 现，而且作者所根据的唯一理由就是作品已临到煞尾阶段一一他们就凭着
作家的权威认为这理由已很充分了。尽管我们同任何作家一样坚持享有这 份权威，然而我们却不轻易使用它，非在迫不得已的情况下，不去使用 ――当前，我们预见不到在这部作品里有必要使用这份权威。
原来奥尔华绥先生心情上的这种变化是他刚刚收到的一封斯奎尔先生 的来信所引起的。我们将让读者在下一章的开头看到它。
第四章
两封风格迥然不同的信
我敬爱的朋友:
上函曾告您医生不准我利用温泉治疗，因为经验证明水疗只会加剧而不会减轻我的症 候。兹有一事必须奉告，我相信朋友们听了将比我更为难过：哈林顿大夫及布鲁斯特大夫已告 诉我，我的病已决无康复之望。
我在某处读到过这样一句话：哲学的重大用途乃在于教人如何去死。因此，我决不会在 接受我应当早已学会的这一课时大惊小怪，玷辱自己。然而，说老实话，关于死亡这一课，
《圣经》的一页要比古今哲学讲得都更中肯。它使我们确信死后还有一个世界。这一信念能够 给予头脑健全的人以强大的支持，得到的慰藉要远比我们从“死是自然界的必然现象尘世浮 华是空虚可厌的”以及其他这类老生常谈得到的多。那些说法尽管有时也能武装我们的心灵， 使之以坚忍不拔的精神去承受死亡的念头，然而却不能把我们提高到确实蔑视死亡，更不会使 我们把死亡看作一件真正的好事。请不要以为我打算把无神论，或甚至绝对否认永生的可怕罪 名加在所有称作哲学家的人们头上。有不少哲学家（古代及现代的）借着理性的光亮，关于未 来的世界发现了一些希望，然而实际上那道光亮是如此之微弱、暗淡，那份希望又是如此之渺 茫而不可靠，我们自然无法肯定他们的信仰究竟是在哪一边。柏拉图自己在《费敦》［3］结尾处 也声明：他的最有力的论据也只不过提出一个盖然性。西塞罗似乎也表示他倾向于相信（而不 是实际相信了）永生的说法。至于我自己，我向您坦白承认，在我没成为真正的基督教徒之 前，我并没真正相信永生。
对后一点，您也许会感到奇怪，但我向您保证，直到最近我才真正有资格自称为基督教 徒。作为哲学家的自豪感使我的理性陷于痴呆状态，就像古希腊人一样，竟然把最崇高的智慧 看作了愚昧。可是上帝是慈悲的，他及时地指出了我的错误，在我将永沉于黑暗深渊之前，把 我领到真理的道路上来。
我自觉气力越来越弱了，因此，就赶快来谈谈写此信的主要用意。
当我省察起一生所作所为时，最使我良心感到负疚的莫过于冤屈了您的养子（那个可怜 的孩子）这件事。我不但对旁人的恶毒行为采取了默许的态度，并且自己也冤屈了他。亲爱的 朋友，请相信一个命在旦夕的人讲的话：他受到极为卑鄙的陷害。至于那件主要事实，我庄重 地向您保证，他实在冤枉，而您是根据歪曲的报告把他驱逐了的。就在大家认为您病势危殆、 行将不起的当儿，全家真正感到忧伤的只他一人。后来发生的事乃由于他得悉您已康复后欢喜 若狂，同时，我不得不指出，还由于某人的阴谋诡计（不过我只想替无辜者伸冤，并不想控诉 任何人）。朋友，请相信，这位年轻人具有极高贵慷慨的胸襟、笃实纯厚的友情、良金美玉的 人格。总之，凡足以使人高贵起来的品德，他都具备了。他自有其过失，然而他从未犯过对您 不敬不义的过失。反之，我确信当您把他赶出去的时候，他为您远比为他自己难过。
我将此事向您隐瞒得这么久，完全是出于尘世的卑鄙下流的动机。如今说出真相，我别 无贪图，纯粹为了维护真理，为无辜者伸冤，并尽我所能以弥补以往之过失。但愿这一声明能 收到预期的效果，使这个应受嘉奖的青年重获您的恩宠。倘能在我离世之前听到这一消息，那 么您就将无上的安慰给予了您最感恩、恭顺而谦卑的仆人，
托马斯•斯奎尔
看完这封信，读者对奥尔华绥先生在态度上起的显著变化也就不会感 到奇怪了一一尽管他收到的同一批邮件中，还有屠瓦孔的一封性质迥然不 同的信。我们把屠瓦孔的信附在这里，因为这也许是我们最后一次提到那 位先生的名字了。
先生：
从您那位可敬的外甥的来信中，得知无神派斯奎尔先生的高足又做了一件坏事，我毫不 感觉奇怪。他犯的任何凶杀罪，对我都非意外。我衷心希望您不至于让自己的鲜血成为把他送 往人们在哀哭、咬牙切齿的那个地方［4］的最后的判决书的封蜡。
尽管您少不得要大大忏悔过去在对待这个无赖方面所表现出的不应有的软弱，以致不但 损害了您的合法的亲属，也损害了您自己的名声；尽管这些此刻已经足以使您的良心受到苛责 的了，然而倘若我不给您忠告，使您对以往的过失产生应有的认识，那我就是没有尽到我的职 责。因此，务请您考虑一下这个歹徒即将受到的判处，并且至少把它当作对您的一次警戒，使 您今后不再忽视一个孜孜为您的幸福祈祷的人所进之忠言。
如果当时我不是受到制止，不能对那个孩子施以应有的惩罚，我早就把他身上的那股邪 恶之气打掉了一一我发现他从襁褓时期就为魔鬼所完全占据，但今日方想及此，已嫌太晚了。
闻您很草率地就把韦斯特顿教区的牧师职位处置了，甚感遗憾。倘若我料到您不预先通 知我一声就这么处置，我一定早就向您提出申请了一一您反对兼职，未免矫枉过正了。倘若说 这样做有什么罪过的话，很多虔信上帝的人势必都不同意。要是奥尔德格罗夫教区的牧师去世 的话（听说他将不久人世了），希望您在物色继任者时想到我；您必深信我是真心维护您的最 高利益的一一尘世利益和这种利益比较起来微不足道，就像《圣经》里提到的“什一赋”［5］比起 法定的税收来微不足道一样。
先生，我是您的忠实、谦卑的仆人，
罗杰•屠瓦孔
这是屠瓦孔第一次用这样专断的笔调写信给奥尔华绥。为这件事，来 日他大有可后悔的一一那些把高度的善良误作高度软弱的人往往会如此。 奥尔华绥确实向来不喜欢这个人。他知道屠瓦孔为人既自负又乖张，也晓 得他的宗教带有个人癖性的色彩，在许多方面乡绅本人是很不赞成的。不 过，屠瓦孔是个杰出的学者，在两个孩子的教育上颇卖力气。此外，他操 守坚正，谨言慎行，在诚实方面无可非议，并且笃信宗教。总的说来，尽 管奥尔华绥对这个人谈不上敬重或爱慕，然而他也不肯把孩子们的这位既
勤恳又有学问、颇称职的塾师辞掉。他希望只要孩子们在自己家里，就在 他眼皮子底下受教育，那么屠瓦孔在教导方面有什么差错，他总可以给矫 正过来。
第五章
本章中这部历史继续下去
奥尔华绥先生在前边的谈话里，勾起往日和琼斯之间的情分，那位好 人不禁热泪盈眶。密勒太太见到这情景，就说："是的，是的，先生，虽然 您竭力想法隐藏，可是您对那个可怜的年轻人的慈爱是尽人皆知的。可是 那帮坏蛋所说的话没有一个字儿是真的。耐廷盖尔先生已经把全部事实都 探听明白了。那帮汉子似乎是一个贵族雇来的。这人是琼斯先生的一个情 敌，他们本打算把他拖上一条船去一一不晓得下一回又该什么人遭到他们 的毒手了。耐廷盖尔先生曾经亲自见过那位军官，一个长得很清秀的绅 士。军官把一切经过全说给他听了。由于答应下这件事，他感到很抱歉， 还说倘若他晓得琼斯先生是位上等人，他决不会去干的；可是他听说琼斯 只是个普通的流浪汉。”
奥尔华绥听了这番话，目瞪口呆。他断言密勒太太说的每一个字，他 都是闻所未闻的。"是的，先生，"她说，"这些情况您一定没听说过。我相 信那帮汉子对律师讲的完全是另外一套话。”
“太太，什么律师？您说的是什么？"奥尔华绥问道。"看，看，”她 说，"自己做了好事还不肯承认，这正是您的为人。不过耐廷盖尔先生见到 他啦。""见到谁，太太？"他问。"咳，还不是您的那位律师，"她说，"您 好心好意派他去了解案情的。""说实在的，您说的我完全不摸头脑，"奥尔 华绥说。"那么，亲爱的，你就告诉奥尔华绥先生吧，"她大声说。"真的， 先生，"耐廷盖尔说，"就是我进来的时候刚从您房里走出去的那位律师： 在阿尔德斯盖特的一家酒店里，我亲眼看到他和费拉玛雇用的两个汉子在 一起。费拉玛雇了几个人打算去拉琼斯先生的夫，因而琼斯先生和费兹帕 特利先生那场不幸的决斗就让他们撞见了。""先生，”密勒太太说，"当我 看见这位先生到您房里来的时候，我就告诉耐廷盖尔先生，我估量一定是 您派这位律师去调查这个案件去的。"奥尔华绥听到这话，神色显得很惊 讶，有两三分钟简直说不出话来。最后，他自己对耐廷盖尔先生说："先 生，我不得不承认，我一辈子再也没听到过比您刚才讲的这段话更叫我吃 惊的了。您确实认得出就是那位先生吗对这一点我是十分肯定的，"耐 廷盖尔回答说。"是在阿尔德斯盖特吗？”奥尔华绥嚷道，"您曾经和这位律 师以及那两个汉子在一起过吗是的，先生，"耐廷盖尔说，"我跟他们
呆了差不多半个钟头。""那么，先生，"奥尔华绥说，"那个律师的态度怎 么样？他和那两个汉子之间说的话您全听见了吗先生，我没有，"耐廷 盖尔回答说，"我还没去的时候他们就在一起了。那位律师当着我的面没怎 么开口。可是经我一再盘问那两个汉子，他们一口咬定的情节和琼斯先生 告诉我的恰好相反，后来根据费兹帕特利先生所说的，我才发现原来他们 讲的全是假话。那位律师当时要那两个汉子一定要讲实话，看来他似乎明 显地站在琼斯先生方面，所以刚才我一见到他同您在一起，就断定必是您 好心把他派去的。""难道不是您派他去的吗？ ”密勒太太问道。"确实不 是，"奥尔华绥回答说，"而且直到现在我才晓得他去办了这么件事。""我 明白啦！"密勒太太说，"真的，我全明白啦！怪不得这些日子他们总在一 起嘀嘀咕咕呢。耐廷盖尔女婿，请你立刻跑去找那些家伙一一除非他们钻 进地缝里了，一定要把他们找来。我自己去找……""亲爱的太太，"奥尔华 绥说，"您别着急，劳驾找个仆人到楼上把道林先生请来一一要是他不在的 话，就请布利非先生来。"密勒太太一路咕哝着走了出去，过不久回报说， 道林先生出门了，可是"那个人"（她这么称呼布利非）"这就来了"。
这位好心的女人情绪激昂，很急于维护她的朋友。奥尔华绥的心情则 比较冷静。不过，他也并非没有类似密勒太太的那种怀疑。布利非一进 来，奥尔华绥先生就带着不像往日那么和善的神色，十分严肃地问他可晓 得道林先生去见过琼斯和一位绅士决斗时的目击者没有。
对于一个存心想隐瞒真相或替谎言狡辩的人，最可怕的莫过于突如其 来地提出的问题。正因为如此，那些以搭救关在中央刑事庭里的同胞为崇 高职责的可敬的先生们，事先总是十分审慎，仔细推敲开庭的那天当事人 可能被问到的每一个问题，以便向他们提供恰当而现成的解答一一如果当 场去想，就是最丰富的想象力也办不到。此外，这种突如其来的问题还会 使血液骤然猛烈上冲，往往造成面色大变，以致被告不得不供出不利于自 己的证词。布利非就正是这样经奥尔华绥先生突然一问，面色顿改，难怪 密勒太太马上嚷道："我敢说，干了亏心事！我可以赌咒说，干了亏心 事！ ”
奥尔华绥先生厉声责备她不可这么急躁，然后对布利非（这时他好像 恨不得往地缝里钻）说："你为什么迟迟不回答我的问题？一定是你派他去 办这档子事的，因为他决不会自动去办，特别是在没通知我一声的情况 下。”
于是，布利非回答说："舅父，我承认自己犯了过失，可是我想您会原 谅我的。""我会原谅你？”奥尔华绥气冲冲地说。"舅父，"布利非说，"我 晓得您会生我的气的，可是亲爱的舅父，我相信您对人类一个最可爱的弱 点所造成的后果一定会加以原谅的。去怜悯不值得怜悯的人，我承认那是 罪过；然而这种罪过连您自己也不能完全避免。我晓得正是为这个人，我 犯过不止一次这种罪过。我承认道林先生确实是我派去的，然而并不是去 做些徒劳无益的调查，而是为了找出目击者，竭力减轻他的罪证。舅舅， 这就是事实的真相。尽管我原来想瞒着您，可是我也不来否认这件事。”
"从道林先生的举止来看，”耐廷盖尔说，"我承认这也是我自己的想 法。"
"好，太太，"奥尔华绥说，"我想您这辈子总得承认一次自己冤枉了 人，也就不会再像过去那样生我外甥的气了吧。”
密勒太太没说什么。虽然她不能马上就对布利非（她认为就是此人害 琼斯落到这步田地的）起好感，然而在当前这件事上，她和在座所有的人 全叫他蒙骗过去了一一魔鬼就是这样全始全终帮它朋友的忙！一般人认为 魔鬼往往在紧要关头抛弃它的朋友，我认为这是对那位仁兄的莫大诬蔑。 有时候它也许会抛弃那些偶尔同它饮上一杯的熟人，或者至多抵得上半个 朋友的人。然而对那些服服帖帖的奴仆，它总是给撑腰的，并把他们从危 难中解救出来，直到他们散伙那天为止。
犹如将一场叛乱镇压后一任政府会得到巩固，或病愈后病者的身体会 完全健全起来一样，一阵怒火平息之后，新的爱抚之感往往也会油然而 生。奥尔华绥先生当前正是如此。布利非这一手使他的大部分怀疑全消释 了，斯奎尔的来信所引起的那一小部分，随之自然也忘得无影无踪。斯奎 尔隐约地攻击了琼斯的冤家对头，这些人的罪名统统由屠瓦孔一人背起来 了。奥尔华绥先生大生他的气。
至于那个年轻人，奥尔华绥先生对他的怒气越来越消除了。他告诉布 利非说，他不但要原谅布利非在善良天性的驱使下所做的这番不寻常的努 力，并且还乐于仿效他的榜样。然后，就带着只有天使才会有的笑容朝密 勒太太转过身来，大声说："太太，您看怎么样，咱们雇一辆马车，一道去 看看您那位朋友好不好？您可以相信，这不是我生平头一次去探监。”
我想每一位读者必然都不难替这位可敬的妇人做出回答，然而如果要 想能体会她此时此刻的心情，那就非具有一颗十分善良的心和深厚的友情
不可了。我希望很少人能够体会到布利非此刻的心情，倘若有这种人的 话，他们也不得不承认布利非是拿不出什么理由来拒绝前往的。可是命运 （或者上面我们刚提到过的那位先生）又帮他解围，没让他经受这次难 堪，因为正要派人去雇车，巴特里奇就来到了。他先把密勒太太单独喊了 出来，告诉她刚刚发现的一件可怕的事。听说奥尔华绥先生想去探狱，就 央求她想法拦住。他说："这件事无论如何也要瞒住乡绅。要是他这时去的 话，就一定会撞见琼斯先生和他的生母一一我离开他的时候她刚来到监狱 ――抱头痛哭，悔恨他们无意中犯下的滔天大罪。”
听到这个恐怖的消息，这位可怜的妇女几乎失掉了知觉。她再没有比 此刻更编不出理由的了。不过，女人在这方面总比男人来得乖觉。她想出 一个借口，就回到奥尔华绥跟前说："先生，如果您听到我不赞成您刚才好 心建议的那件事，您必然会感到很意外。可要是咱们立刻就那样办，我怕 会有不好的结果。先生，您可以估量到那个可怜的年轻人近来所遭到的种 种灾难一定使他精神极其沮丧。要是咱们猛然又叫他狂喜一阵一一我晓得 您一去他必然会那样一一我恐怕会给他造成不可挽救的损害，尤其内外他 那个仆人告诉我说，琼斯先生身体很差。”
"他的仆人在内外吗？”奥尔华绥大声说，"请您叫他进来。我要问他一 些他主人的情况。”
巴特里奇最初很怕见奥尔华绥先生。密勒太太多次听过巴特里奇叙述 他自己的身世，所以她竭力劝说，并且答应出面介绍，巴特里奇才同意进 去。
尽管奥尔华绥已经多年没见到巴特里奇，他一走进来，乡绅还是马上 就记起他来了。因此，密勒太太本来打算作的一番演说也就可以省却一一 我想读者必然已经注意到这位好心妇人的特点之一是总喜欢替朋友帮几句 腔。
"你就是琼斯先生的仆人吗？”奥尔华绥问巴特里奇道。"先生，我还说 不上是他正式的仆人，"巴特里奇回答说，"不过，禀告老爷，我眼下跟他 住在一起。正如老爷清清楚楚晓得的，Non sum qualis eram °[6]"
然后，奥尔华绥先生问了他许多关于琼斯的情况，诸如他的健康等 等。巴特里奇在回答所有这些问题的时候，都只按照他所希望给予对方的 印象来回答，毫不考虑实际的情况，因为在这个老实人的伦理或宗教的信 条中，并没有严格遵循真理这一项。
他们交谈的时候，耐廷盖尔先生就告辞了。过一会儿，密勒太太也走 了出去。接着，奥尔华绥把布利非也打发开，因为他估量，要是单独谈， 巴特里奇总比当着众人谈得更坦率一些。大家都走掉以后，奥尔华绥立刻 就像下一章所叙述的那样开了话头。

第六章
本章中这部历史依然继续下去
"朋友，"奥尔华绥说，"你真是个最古怪的人了。以前因为坚持谎言， 死不回头，落到这步田地，现在却还要把谎言坚持到底，这样到处冒充你 亲生儿子的仆人！这样干究竟对你有什么好处！你的用意究竟何在？"
"先生，"巴特里奇跪倒在地说道："看来大人对我怀下成见，我说什么 您都拿定主意不肯相信的了，那么我表白又有什么意义！可是老天晓得我 并不是这个年轻人的父亲。”
"怎么！"奥尔华绥说，"对于以往根据这么确凿、这么无可争辩的证据 判定的案子，你竟然还来否认吗？如今又发现你和这个年轻人在一起，这 不就更证明二十年前对你控诉的事全部属实了吗？我以为你已经漂到海外 ――甚至以为你早已去世了......你是怎么晓得这个年轻人的情况的？如果 你没跟他一直保持着联系，那么你们是怎么相遇的？不要再否认下去了。 你可以放心，承认这事实只会大大增加我对你儿子的好感，因为这么一来 我就会发现这孩子很懂得尽孝，这么多年来私下里一直养活着他的生身之 父。”
"大人要是肯耐心听下去，"巴特里奇说，"我就把一切都告诉您。"奥 尔华绥先生吩咐他讲下去，于是，巴特里奇就这么讲开了："自从那次失掉 大人的恩宠以后，过不久我就毁了：私塾停办了，牧师想来是为了讨您的 欢喜，又撤掉我那个抄写员的差事；所以只给我留下个理发店一一在那样 一个乡村，光靠理发是糊不了口的。等我的妻子一死（她去世以前有一位 不肯说出姓氏的人每年总津贴我们十二镑；我想准是大人您给的，因为除 了您，我没听说过谁做这样的事）一一但是，正像我刚才要说的，她一去 世，这笔年金也就没有了。这时候，我欠下的两三笔数目不大的债务开始 使我遭到麻烦，其中，特别有一笔债务，本来只有十五先令，律师把诉讼 费加了上去，竟变为快到三十镑了。［刀看到我一向赖以糊口的营生全干不成 了，我就尽量收拾起我仅剩的那点家当出走了。
"我先到了索尔兹伯里，在一位律师手下找到个差事。他是我生平见到 的一位最好的人。他不但待我好，在我和他相处的那段日子里，我晓得他 做过上千件善行和义举。我知道他时常拒绝受理某些卑鄙的、倚势欺人的 案件……""你不必细说啦，"奥尔华绥说，"我认识这位绅士。他确实是个
正人君子，给律师界增光添彩。皿好吧，先生，”巴特里奇接着说下 去，"从那里我搬到利明顿［8］去，在另一位律师下面当了三年多差。这人也 很不错，而且，我敢说他是全英国顶快活的一个人了。先生，那么第三年 的年底，我就自己开了个私塾；如果不是遇上一件不幸，本来我很可能好 起来的。我在那儿养了 一 口猪。有一天交了噩运，这口猪闯了出去，’侵 入’（我想他们是这么说的）邻居的花园里。这位邻居很狂傲，喜欢报复。 他就聘了一位律师，他叫……他叫……我记不起他的名字了。可是他递了 个状子把我告下来，巡回法庭就把我传了去。我就去过庭啦。唉，我的老 天，听听那些律师的胡说八道吧。其中有一个向法官大人讲了我一大堆最 无耻的谎言。他说我常把猪群赶到人家花园里去，还说了许多旁的话。最 后，他说他希望我终于把猪群赶到一个市集上去了。听起来，我好像并不 是只有一口可怜的小猪，而是全英国最大的猪贩子了。可是……皿对不 起，"奥尔华绥说，"不要讲得这么详细，我还没听你讲到你儿子的事 呢。""啊，”巴特里奇说，"好多年以后我才看见了（照您的说法）我的儿 子。接着我就到爱尔兰去，在科克教书一一因为前次的官司又害得我一败 涂地，在温切斯特坐了七年牢……""好吧，"奥尔华绥说，"略过这段去， 就从你回到英国谈起吧。""然后，先生，"他说，"大约半年以前，我在布 里斯托尔上了岸，在那里勾留了一阵子，看看不行，又听说布里斯托尔到 格洛斯特之间的一个地方有个理发师刚刚去世，我就赶到那里，约莫两个 月以后，琼斯先生来了。"然后，他就对奥尔华绥仔细叙述了初次和琼斯邂 逅的经过，尽他记忆所及，把从那天直到现在的一切细节都讲了。在叙述 当中，还时常插进一些赞美琼斯的话，并且也没忘记暗示琼斯对奥尔华绥 的一腔敬爱。最后说道："大人，我已经把一切真相都告诉您了。"然后， 他又一再郑重声明他不是琼斯的生身之父，正如他不是罗马教皇的生身之 父一样，并且赌咒说，倘若有半点虚假，就让他遭到天诛地灭。
"我简直不知道该怎么想啦！"奥尔华绥嚷道，"承认这个关系明明对你 有好处，你为什么死不承认大人，"巴特里奇回答说（他实在按捺不住 了），"您要是不相信我，不久您也会得到证明。但愿您就像替那个年轻人 认错了父亲一样，也替他认错了母亲。"这时，奥尔华绥问起他这话是什么 意思，巴特里奇的声音里和脸色上全充满了恐怖，把刚才他还对密勒太太 表示竭力想瞒过奥尔华绥的那件事原原本本讲了出来。
奥尔华绥听到这桩发现时，几乎和巴特里奇叙述时同样毛骨悚然。"天 哪！"他说，"邪恶和放荡可以把人陷到多么悲惨的境地！罪恶的后果有时 候会深远到多么难以预期啊！"话音未落，沃特尔太太突然匆匆地闯了进 来。巴特里奇一看到她，马上就嚷道："大人，这就是那个女人。她就是琼 斯先生那位不幸的母亲。我相信她会在您跟前替我洗清一切的。太太，说 吧……”
沃特尔太太没理会巴特里奇说的话，几乎也没理睬他这个人。她走到 奥尔华绥先生跟前，说道："先生，我是多年前拜见过您的，想来您一定记 不得我了。""确实是这样，"奥尔华绥回答说，"在许多方面您都和以前不 一样了，要不是这位事先告诉了我您是谁，我是不会立刻认出您来的。太 太，您是为着什么特别的事情来找我的吗？"说这话时，奥尔华绥的态度很 冷淡。读者不难料到，对这位妇人的行径一一不论以前听到的还是巴特里 奇方才谈起的，他都是不高兴的。
沃特尔太太回答说："可不是嘛，先生，我有一件很特别的事要找您。 这件事我只能同您本人谈。所以我要求您单独接见我。我向您保证，我要 告诉您的是一桩十分重大的事。”
于是，奥尔华绥就吩咐巴特里奇出去。临走开之前，巴特里奇又央求 沃特尔太太一定要让奥尔华绥先生晓得他是完全清白无辜的。对这请托， 她回答说："先生，您不必担心，我一定让奥尔华绥先生完全弄清那件 事。”
然后，巴特里奇就走了出去。奥尔华绥先生和沃特尔太太之间的谈话 记在下一章里。
第七章
这部历史继续下去
沃特尔太太沉默了一下，奥尔华绥先生不禁说道："太太，我感到很遗 憾，因为就我这些年来所听到的，您滥用了……""奥尔华绥先生，"她插嘴 说道，"我知道我曾经做过错事，然而我从来也没对您忘恩负义过。我永远 不能也不会忘掉您那番好心一一我承认自己是很不配的。不过，眼下请您 先别责备我，因为我是来告诉您有关这个年轻人（就是您把我娘家的姓琼 斯给了他的那位）一件十分重要的事。”
"那么，"奥尔华绥说，"难道我由于不明真相而误罚了一个无辜者一一 就是刚才走出去的那个人吗？难道他并不是孩子的生身之父？""他真的不 是，"沃特尔太太说，"先生，您也许还记得，当初我曾对您说过，有朝一 日您终必知道的。我承认自己本应早些时候告诉您这件事的真相，我这种 疏忽必然给您造成了很大的痛苦。老实说，我也没料到这样做有多么必 要。""那么，太太，"奥尔华绥说，"就请说下去吧。""先生，"她说，"您 一定还记得一个叫萨默的年轻人吧。""记得的，"奥尔华绥大声说，"他是 一位学问好、品德高的牧师的儿子，我和那位牧师交情很深。""看来是这 样，”她说，"因为我相信是您把那年轻人培养起来，供他上大学的。我 想，他完成了学业就到您府上来住了。我敢说，太阳从没照耀过比他更俊 的人了。他不但是我生平见到的最漂亮的男子，而且又那么文雅，那么聪 明，有教养。""可怜的人哪，"奥尔华绥说，"他死得实在太早了。但我决 没想到他会背起这种罪名。我已经看出您是要告诉我，萨默就是您那孩子 的生身之父了。”
"先生，"她回答说，"他不是的。""怎么？”奥尔华绥说，"不是的话， 您前头这段话说它干吗呢是为了讲一件跟我有关的事，"她说，"注定 要由我向您申述。啊，先生，请您准备听一件使您吃惊，也会使您难过的 事吧……""说吧，"奥尔华绥说，"我不觉得自己造过什么孽，所以也不怕 你讲出什么来。"“先生，"她说，“这位萨默先生，您朋友的儿子，由您资 助完成了学业，在您府上就像您亲生的儿子般住了一年后，患天花症死 了；您为他的死而痛哭流涕过，把他当作自己亲生的儿子似的安葬了一一 先生，那个萨默就是这个孩子的父亲。""怎么，”奥尔华绥说，"你这岂不 是自相矛盾吗并不，"她回答说，"他确实是孩子的父亲，孩子却不是
我养的。""当心，太太，"奥尔华绥说，"千万别为了躲避罪责而扯谎。应 该记得你什么也瞒不住上帝。扯谎的话，在他的审判庭上只会加重你的罪 名。""先生，"她说，"我真不是孩子的母亲。不论有多大好处，我现在也 不能把自己看作他的母亲。""我晓得你的原因，"奥尔华绥说，"倘若事情 真不像我所以为的，我会和你一样高兴。不过，你莫忘记，当年是你亲口 向我招认的。皿我向您招认过是我亲手把婴儿放到您的床上的，”她 说，"那并不假一一可我是依照婴儿的那位母亲的吩咐放的呀；我后来的招 认也是她吩咐的。我还觉得由于她的慷慨，我为保守这个秘密以及自己承 受的耻辱已经获得了丰厚的报酬。皿这个女人究竟是谁呢？"奥尔华绥 说。"我真害怕说出她的名字来，"沃特尔太太回答说。"从您事先打的这些 招呼看，我猜想她必是我的一个亲属，"他大声说道。"她确实是很近的亲 属。"听到这话，奥尔华绥大吃一惊。沃特尔太太继续说下去："先生，您 曾经有过一个妹妹。""一个妹妹！"他神色惊愕地重复着。"正如上天确有 真理一样，”她大声说，"您的妹妹就是您在床上发现的那个孩子的母 亲。""啊，我的老天，这是可能的吗？”他大声嚷着。"先生，请您耐心一 下，"沃特尔太太说，"我把这件事的全部经过原原本本说给您听。就在您 那回去伦敦以后，有一天白丽洁小姐到我母亲家去了，说她听人讲起我的 品格非凡，有学问，比那一带所有的年轻女人都懂道理。她是这么夸奖我 的。然后她叫我到您那高大宅第去见她，去了之后，她派我读书给她听。 她很满意我的朗读，待我很厚，送了我许多礼物。最后，她就讯问我能不 能替她保守一个秘密，我给她一个满意的答复。最后，她先把她的房门锁 上，把我领进内室，把这门也锁上了。她说她将要告诉我一件与她的名誉 攸关一一因而也与她的性命攸关的事，来证明她对我的忠诚可靠是完全信 赖的。说到这里她停了一会儿，沉默了几分钟，不住地擦眼泪，然后问我 是不是认为我的母亲也信得过。我说，我可以用性命担保她是忠实的。随 后，她就向我吐露了一个郁结在她心头的重大秘密，我相信她向我吐露时 的痛苦，比后来她在分娩中所经受到的还要大。当时就订好计划，她分娩 时只由我和我母亲侍候，事先就把威尔根斯大娘打发开一一后来白丽洁小 姐就按照这个计策把她派到多塞特郡顶边远的地方调查一个仆人的品行去 了。分娩前将近三个月的时候，小姐就把自己的女仆辞退了。这段日子 里，她叫我（用她的说法）先试试工一一后来她说我笨手笨脚的，不大合 用。这话以及其他类似的话，她都是故意散布出去，好避免日后我把孩子
认下来时，威尔根斯不至于起疑心一一因为她认为人们决不会相信如果她 让一个年轻妇女参与了这样重大的机密还敢对她这样恶言恶语的。当然， 我忍受这一切侮辱也是得到了丰厚的报酬的，同时，我又了解个中的底 细，所以也是心甘情愿的。老实说，白丽洁小姐最放心不下的是威尔根斯 大娘，并不是她对那位管家婆怀有什么敌意，不过，她认为威尔根斯大娘 是不会保守秘密的一一尤其不会对您保密；因为我多次听白丽洁小姐说 过，要是威尔根斯大娘杀了人，她也准会跑来告诉您的。期待的日子终于 来到，于是威尔根斯大娘被差遣出去了一一一个星期前她本就已经准备停 当，却在这样那样的借口下，让她推迟行期，免得她过早地回来。然后， 孩子生下来了，在场的只有我和我的母亲，并且由我母亲把他抱到她自己 家去，偷偷养到您回来的那天晚上，我才遵照白丽洁小姐的吩咐，把孩子 送到您的床上一一就是您发现他的地方。由于您的妹妹装作对孩子很厌 恶，好像她对孩子表示的任何关怀，都是为了讨您的欢喜，她装得十分巧 妙，所以事后什么怀疑也没引起过。”
沃特尔太太一再保证她说的全是实情，最后还说："先生，您终于认出 您的外甥了。我相信，此后您一定会这样看待他。我也毫不怀疑作为您的 外甥，他会为您增光，使您得到慰藉。”
"太太，"奥尔华绥说，"不用说您也知道您所告诉我的这些使我有多么 震惊。然而您决不会、也不可能把这么多情节凑在一起来证明一件莫须有 的事。我承认我记起几件有关萨默的事，当时曾使我觉得我妹妹对他有些 好感。我向她提过这一点，因为我很看重那个年轻人，为了他本人以及他 父亲的缘故，我都会欣然同意他们缔婚的。但是她对我这种刻薄的怀疑 （这是她的说法）表示了极大的愤慨，所以后来我就一直没再提起了。天 哪！唉，一切事物反正上帝自有安排。然而我妹妹决不该带着这个秘密离 开人世。皿这一点您可以相信，”沃特尔太太说，"她从未有过那样的意 图。她曾多次对我说，她打算有一天告诉您这件事。她还说，她的计谋这 么圆满成功，您不需劝说就喜欢上孩子，她自是感到非常庆幸；这样一 来，她一时还无需特地向您坦白。啊，先生，要是小姐在世，看到您把这 个可怜的年轻人当作流浪汉赶出大门；不但如此，要是她仍然活着，听到 您聘请律师控告他并不曾犯过的杀人罪的话一一奥尔华绥先生，请恕我不 得不说一句：这样做是不仁厚的！真的，您受了什么人的欺骗了。琼斯先 生决没有您想的那么坏。""哦，太太，"奥尔华绥说，"不管是谁对您讲这
些话的，欺骗我的正是那个人。""不，先生，"她说，"您不要误会我的意 思。我决不敢说您做了什么冤屈人的事。来找我的那位先生也没建议那样 的事。他只不过说一一他把我误作费兹帕特利先生的妻子了一一要是我的 丈夫死在琼斯先生手里的话，有一位高贵的绅士愿意充分资助我打这场官 司，还说那位绅士很清楚我需要对付的是怎样一个恶棍。我是从这位绅士 那里才晓得琼斯先生是谁的。那位绅士姓道林，据琼斯先生告诉我，他是 您府上的管事。我是十分凑巧得知他的姓名的一一他本人不肯告诉我，可 是巴特里奇第二次到我住处来的时候碰见了他。巴特里奇以前在索尔兹伯 里认识道林先生的。”
"这位道林先生可曾对您说我要资助您打这场官司吗？"奥尔华绥脸上 显得十分震惊，问道。"没有，先生，"她回答说，"我决不乱给他加罪名。 他只说有人会出钱帮助，可是并没提是谁。不过，先生，您必须原谅我， 根据种种情节来看，除了您我想不出旁的人。""太太，”奥尔华绥说，"其 实，根据种种情节来看，我相信这准是旁的人。天哪！最深沉最恶毒的勾 当有时会多么巧妙地暴露出来啊！太太，您可不可以等一等您提到的那个 人，我指望他随时都会来的。甚至说不定他已经到了。”
然后，奥尔华绥走到门口去喊仆人。这时走进来的不是道林先生，而 是下一章里我们将见到的那位绅士。
第八章
再继续下去
进来的这位绅士不是旁人，正是魏斯顿先生。他丝毫不考虑有沃特尔 太太在场，一见到奥尔华绥先生，立刻就这么叫嚷起来："我家里出了好事 啦！搞得一塌糊涂，终于给我发觉了。鬼才愿意养个丫头惹这种麻烦 呢出了什么事啦，好街坊？"奥尔华绥问。"出了大事啦，"魏斯顿回答 说，"正当我以为她回心转意了一一不，可以说她已经答应完全按照我的意 思办，而我也满心希望只消请个律师就了却我这桩心愿了，你猜给我抓到 了什么？原来这个小婊子一直在跟我玩把戏，偷偷跟你家那个野种通着 信。我妹妹魏斯顿（就为了这个丫头的缘故我才跟她吵了嘴）派人给我送 来这个口信，于是，我吩咐趁她睡觉的时候搜她的衣袋。瞧，搜出这封信 来，下款署着你家那个野种的名字。我连一半也读不下去，比撒波尔牧师 的说教还长。不过，我看得很清楚里头谈的全是爱情一一当然，还谈得出 什么旁的！我又把她关在屋里了，除非她答应立刻出嫁，不然的话，明天 一早她就得给我滚回乡下去。我就把她关在阁楼里，叫她一辈子在那儿吃 白水面包。妈的，这丫头的心碎得越快越好，可是看来她那颗心结实得很 呢。她准是要活得长长的，好来折磨我。""魏斯顿先生，"奥尔华绥回答 说，"你晓得我一向反对使用暴力的。你曾亲自答应过我决不使 用。""嗯，”他嚷道，"不过，条件是不使用暴力她也同意。真是见鬼！难 道自己亲生的女儿还不听我摆布吗一一况且我还不是为她好？""那么，好 街坊，"奥尔华绥说，"要是你同意的话，我就去劝劝你家小姐。皿你肯 吗？ ”魏斯顿说，"那是你好心，也尽了街坊的情谊啦。也许你比我有办 法。你可以相信，她对你是非常敬重的。皿那么，先生，"奥尔华绥 说，"你回去把小姐放出来吧，不出半个钟头我就去看望她。""不过，”魏 斯顿说，"万一这当儿她跟人跑掉了呢？道林律师告诉我，没法指望那小子 上绞刑架了，因为受伤的人没死，而且会好起来。他认为琼斯不久就会出 狱的。皿怎么？"奥尔华绥说，"难道是你委托他去探听或者干预这件事 的不是我，"魏斯顿回答说，"刚才是他主动向我提起的。""刚才？”奥 尔华绥嚷道，"那么你是在哪儿见到他的？我很想找到道林先生。""喏，此 刻你要是到我家去，就可以见着他。今天早晨有一些律师要在我家聚会， 讨论一件抵押品的问题。哼，我又得损失两三千镑，准是那位忠厚绅士耐
廷盖尔先生捣的鬼。""那么，先生，"奥尔华绥说，"不出半个小时我就到 您府上来。""你最好听取一次傻子的劝告，"乡绅大声说，"跟她打交道千 万别想使用温和手段，记住我这句话：那样做决不会成功的。我已经试了 很久啦。非把她吓住不可，没有旁的办法。告诉她我是她的老子，让她知 道不听父亲的话是罪大恶极，死后要受可怕的惩罚。然后还告诉她，我要 把她在阁楼里关一辈子，叫她只靠面包和白水过活。皿我一定尽力而 为，"奥尔华绥说，"因为我最希望的莫过于把这位可爱的人儿娶到我家 来。""这丫头当个儿媳妇倒是很好的，"乡绅叫道，"一个人走得越远，遇 上的饭菜可能越糟一一尽管她是我亲生的女儿，我还是可以这么说。而 且，只要她肯听我的话，一百哩以内再也找不到一个像我这么疼爱女儿的 老子。不过，我看你跟这位太太还有事情要办，那么我就回家等你去吧。 失陪失陪。”
魏斯顿刚走，沃特尔太太就说："先生，看来这位乡绅一点儿也认不出 我啦。奥尔华绥先生，我想您一定也不会认得我啦。从您好心对我进行那 次忠告以后，我大大变了样子一一要是我能照您劝我的那样做去，我本来 会幸福的。""太太，确是如此，"奥尔华绥叫道，"当我听说您走的是相反 的一条路时，我十分难过。""先生，"她说，"我被一个非常恶毒的骗局坑 害啦。您要是晓得了实际情况，尽管我不敢希望我在您眼中就没有罪过， 但至少会减轻我的罪名，引起您对我的怜悯。眼下您没工夫听我把整个经 过全讲出来，不过请您相信这一点：我是被人用最庄严的婚娶诺言骗了 的。不，在上帝眼中，我是已经嫁给了他的。关于这个问题我读了许多 书，我深信那种特定的仪式只不过是为了使婚姻在法律上获得认可所需要 经过的手续，只具有授予女方以妻子特权的世俗用途。可是倘若一个女人 私下里起过盟誓，并且对她所委身的男人一直是忠实的，那么不管世人叫 她什么，她是问心无愧的。""太太，”奥尔华绥说，"可惜您错用了您那份 学问了。其实，您的学问要是更渊博，或者您一直是愚昧无知，倒许好一 些。可是，太太，恐怕您犯的罪过还不止这一件。""我向您郑重保证，"她 说，"他在世的时候一一也就是十多年间，我没犯什么罪过。而且，请先生 设身处地替我想一想：一个丧失了名誉的衣食无着的女人还有什么力量？ 即使她满心想回到正路上来，善良的世人肯容许一只迷途的羔羊这样做 吗？要是我有能力的话，我是会选择正路的。但是穷困把我赶到沃特尔大 尉的怀抱里一一尽管直到现在我们也还没举行婚礼，我却像妻子般地和他
同居了多年，从了他的姓氏。我和沃特尔先生在沃斯特城分的手，他开拔 打叛军去了。后来，我偶尔遇到了琼斯先生一一他把我从一个歹徒手里救 出来。他真是一个顶可敬重的人了。我相信像他那般年龄的年轻人，都难 免要荒唐一些的，可是在品德上及得上他二十分之一的也不多。不管他有 什么样的过失，我深深相信他现在已经立志永不再犯了。""但愿如此，"奥 尔华绥大声说，"并且希望他坚持下去。我还必须说，对于您，我抱着同样 的希望。我同意您的说法：在这类事情上，世人往往是冷酷无情的，可以 说是不愿意加以怜悯；然而时间以及经久不懈的努力总会克服他们这种倾 向。因为尽管世人并不像上帝那样乐于接待悔改的罪人，可是只要不断地 悔改下去，那么连世人的心也终于会软下来。沃特尔太太，您可以相信， 只要我觉得您这美好的意愿是真诚的，我就一定尽到我的力量，帮您实 现。”
如今沃特尔太太跪在他面前，泪如雨下，对他的恩泽（那正如她所说 的，近乎神性多于人性）一再表示感激。
奥尔华绥把她扶起来，用最柔和的神情同她讲话，尽他想得出的一切 话语来安慰她。这时，道林先生进来，把他的话打断了。道林先生一进 门，看到沃特尔太太，吃了一惊，显出手足无措的样子。他马上竭力镇定 下来，然后说他有急事必须赶到魏斯顿先生住处去商议，不过，觉得他理 应前来把律师们对于他上次提到的那桩案子的意见，报告给奥尔华绥先 生；律师们认为拾金据为己有，不能以刑事论罪，但原主还是可以提出要 求偿还被侵占财物的诉讼，如果陪审官们认为钱确属原告，可以判令归 还。
奥尔华绥对这番话没作表示，却闩上房门，然后绷着面孔走到道林跟 前，对他说："先生，不管你多么匆忙，也先得回答我几个问题。你认识不 认识这位太太先生，这位太太？"道林非常踌躇地说。奥尔华绥于是用 极严肃的口吻对他说："道林先生，听着！你既然珍视我对你的倚重一一或 者说，你不愿意我立刻把你辞退，那么就请你不要搪塞支吾，必须老老实 实地回答我每一个问题一一你认不认识这位太太认得的，先生，"道林 说，"我见过这位太太。""在哪里在她自己的寓所。""你到那里去干什 么，先生？谁派你去的我是去，先生一一调查，先生一一琼斯先生的 事的。皿谁派你去调查他的事的？皿谁？自然是布利非先生派我去的 呀。""那么，关于那件事，你对这位太太是怎么谈的先生，我可想不
起原话了。皿太太，您肯帮助这位先生回忆一下吗？皿他对我说，先 生，"沃特尔太太说，"要是我的丈夫死在琼斯先生手里的话，有一位高贵 的绅士愿意充分资助我打这场官司，那位绅士很清楚我需要对付的是怎样 一个恶棍。我可以完全有把握发誓，这就是他的原话。""这是你说的吗， 先生？”奥尔华绥问。"我不能把每个字都记住，"道林大声说，"但是我相 信大意确是这样。”"是布利非先生吩咐你那么说的先生，我当然不会 自动到那里去，在这类事情上我也不会随便越出自己的职权。如果我那么 说了，我一定是那么理解了布利非先生的指示。""道林先生，你听着，"奥 尔华绥说，"当着这位太太我向你许诺：只要你现在对我实话实说，在这件 事情上凡是你按照布利非先生的指示所做的一切，我一概予以宽恕。因为 我相信你刚才说的：关于这件事，你如果没受到委托，决不会自己去进行 活动……那么也是布利非先生派你去阿尔德斯盖特盘问那两个家伙的 吧是他派我去的，先生。""那么，那一回他是怎么指示你的呢？你尽 可能回想一下，并且尽量把他的原话告诉我。""喏，先生，布利非先生派 我去找到那场决斗的目击者。他说，他怕琼斯先生或者他的一些朋友会把 他们收买了。他说，血债就得用血来还。不但窝藏杀人犯的人，就是那些 没有尽一切力量使杀人犯受到法律制裁的人，也和他同等罪过。他说，他 发觉您也很想叫那个歹徒受到法律制裁，不过不宜于由您出面就是 了。""他是这么说的？”奥尔华绥说。"是的，先生，"道林大声说，"世上 除了您，为任何人我都不应当把事情进行到那样的极限。皿怎样的极 限不，先生，"道林嚷道，"我决不愿意您认为我犯下了教唆人去作伪 证的罪过。不过作证的方法有两种。我告诉他们，如果对方表示给他们什 么好处，一定不要收下；我并且向他们保证，只要他们老老实实讲真话， 就决不会吃亏的。我还说，据我们所知，是琼斯先动手刺那位绅士的；事 实如果是这样，他们就应该这样讲出来。我确实暗示过决不会让他们吃亏 的。皿你确是做到极限了，"奥尔华绥嚷道。"不，先生，”道林回答 说，"我相信我并没要他们编造什么呀！而且如果不是为了迎合您的心意， 我也不会那么说的。""我相信你不会以为那样是迎合我的心意的，"奥尔华 绥说，"要是你晓得琼斯先生是我嫡亲外甥的话。""先生，"道林说，"对于 我认为您有意隐瞒的事，我相信我是不宜于去注意的。""哦！”奥尔华绥嚷 道，"那么你是晓得的喽喏，先生，"道林说，"既然您要我讲出真相 来，那么我就讲了。先生，我确实晓得这件事，因为这几乎是布利非太太
弥留之际所说的最后几句话，当时只有我一个人站在她床旁边，她递给我 后来交给了您的那封信。""什么信？"奥尔华绥嚷道。"先生，就是我从索 尔兹伯里带回来的那封信，"道林回答说，"我把它交到布利非先生手中 了。""啊，天哪！"奥尔华绥嚷道，"我妹妹讲了些什么话？她对你说什么 来着？皿她握着我的手，”他回答说，"当她递给我那封信的时候，说 道：’我也不知道写了些什么。告诉我哥哥，琼斯先生是他的外甥……他是 我的儿子……愿上帝赐福给他。’说完，她就朝后一仰，仿佛要断气的样 子。我马上喊人进来。她再也没对我说什么，过不了几分钟就去世了。"奥 尔华绥默默地站了一会儿，仰首望了望，然后转过身来问道林："那么你为 什么没把她的遗言转告给我啊大人，"他回答说，"您一定还记得，当 时您正卧病在床呀。我又忙得不可开交（我总是那样），就把信交给布利 非先生了，遗言也托他转达。他答应两样都带到，后来他告诉我已经照转 了 ；并且告诉我，您一方面为了爱护琼斯先生，一方面为了顾全您的妹 妹，打算把这件事瞒起来，永不外传。因此，要不是您先对我提起，我决 不认为我有权利向您或任何人去谈这件事的。”
我们在旁处曾指出过，一个人可以用实话来撒谎，当前就是这样。道 林转述给奥尔华绥先生的那番话，布利非确实说过，但是布利非并没骗 他，他也不认为能骗得过去。实际上，促使道林对这件事守口如瓶的是布 利非许下的诺言。如今，道林清楚地看出布利非已经无法兑现他所许诺的 一切了，便认为此刻应该坦白出来一一奥尔华绥先生许下予以宽恕的诺 言，再加上他提出的警告、他的声调和神情以及他事先所发觉的，一切都 迫使道林吐露真情，况且事情出其不意，道林也来不及想出一些支吾的遁 词。
看来奥尔华绥对道林这番叙述很满意，他嘱咐道林不要声张，然后亲 自把那位先生送出门去，免得他看到布利非。这时候，布利非已回到自己 房间里，想着新近蒙哄他舅父的这件事。兴高采烈，完全没料到这期间楼 下发生的事。
奥尔华绥回转来的时候，在过道上碰见了密勒太太。她脸色惨白、恐 惧异常地对他说："啊，先生，我看见那个坏女人跟您谈话来着，您一定全 晓得了。可是请您不要为这件事就抛弃这个可怜的年轻人。您想，他并不 知道那是他的亲娘呀。您就是不对他狠心，单单这一发现恐怕就会叫他难 过死了。”
"太太，"奥尔华绥说，"我刚才听到的一件事叫我吃惊极了，我真没法 跟您讲个明白。不过，请到我房里来吧。密勒太太，我确实有了惊人的发 现，您马上就会晓得。”
这个可怜的妇人浑身战抖着跟他进来了。这时，奥尔华绥走到沃特尔 太太跟前，握着她的手，然后掉转身来对密勒太太说："这位太太给我帮了 个大忙，我该怎样酬劳她呀。啊，密勒太太，您曾千百次听到我管那个年 轻人（您是他多么忠实的朋友）称作我的儿子。当时，我完全没料到他当 真是我的亲属。太太，您的这位朋友是我的外甥。多年来在我怀里哺养大 的那条邪恶的毒蛇四和他原来是同胞兄弟。这位太太会亲自告诉您全部事 实，以及琼斯怎么被认作是她的儿子的。真的，密勒太太，我深深相信琼 斯受到了冤屈，我被人欺骗了一一骗我的是您早就怀疑是个坏蛋的那个家 伙，您怀疑得很对。他的确是个顶坏的坏蛋。”
这时，欢悦的心情使密勒太太失去了讲话的能力一一如果不是两行友 谊的热泪及时救了她，不死，她也会失掉知觉的。最后，等她从狂喜中恢 复过来，勉强能讲话的时候，就嚷道："这么说来，亲爱的琼斯先生就是您 的外甥，而不是这位太太的儿子吗？您终于看出他的真实面目啦！那么我 就可以活着看到他享受他理应享受的幸福了吗？""他确实是我的外甥，"奥 尔华绥说，"其他方面我也希望全能像您所盼望的。”"这件事情得以真相大 白都是亏了这位好心的太太吗？”密勒太太嚷道。"可不，都亏了她，"奥尔 华绥说。"啊，"她跪下来大声说，"那么但愿上帝赐她鸿福。不管她造过多 少孽，这一件善举就足以使她完全得到宽恕！”
然后，沃特尔太太告诉他们琼斯马上就一定可以获释了，因为一位贵 族正陪着外科大夫去见收押琼斯先生的那个法官，以便证明费兹帕特利先 生业已脱离险境，犯人也就可以重获自由。
奥尔华绥说，眼下他有点重要事情，不得不出去一趟，回来的时候能 见到这位外甥，他会十分高兴的。然后他吩咐仆人替他喊来一顶轿子，随 即和两位太太告别。
布利非先生一听说喊轿子，马上就奔下楼来伺候舅父一一这种礼数他 是从不短缺的。他问他舅父是不是要出门，这是问一个人到什么地方去的 客气说法。奥尔华绥没理睬他这个问题。布利非又问他什么时候回来，对 方仍然没搭理。直到快上轿的当儿，奥尔华绥才掉转身来对他说："听着，
先生！在我回来以前，替我找出你母亲临终写给我的那封信。"然后，奥尔 华绥就走了，把布利非留在只有将要上绞刑架的人才会羡慕的境地。
第九章
仍旧继续下去
奥尔华绥利用乘轿的工夫读了琼斯写给苏菲亚的信，那是魏斯顿交给 他的。其中有些话涉及他本人，使他感动得眼里噙满了泪水。最后，他来 到魏斯顿的寓所，会见了苏菲亚。
说完客套之后，两位就各自坐在椅子上，沉默了好一会儿。这当儿， 奉父命来会这位客人的苏菲亚坐在那里摆弄着扇子，举止神情都充满了惶 惑不安。终于，自己也有些尴尬的奥尔华绥这样开口了："魏斯顿小姐，恐 怕舍下给您造成不少苦恼，我无意中也大大助长了这事。小姐，您可以相 信，倘若我从一开头就晓得您不乐意这门亲事，我决不会叫您受这么些日 子的罪。因此，我希望您别以为我这次登内拜访是要就这一方面提出什么 进一步的请求来麻烦您，我是来使您完全摆脱那件亲事的。”
"先生，”苏菲亚带些腼腆而踌躇地说，"您这样做真是再仁厚慷慨不 过，在我看，也只有奥尔华绥先生能这么做。既然您提起这桩事，那么恕 我对您说，它确实给了我很多苦恼；由于这事，我受到家父的虐待一一而 在这桩不幸事件发生以前，他一直是位最慈祥、最钟爱我的父亲。我深信 以您那样的仁厚慷慨，决不会因为我拒绝了您的外甥而生我的气。人是不 能左右自己的好恶的。不管他有怎样的优点，我也不能强使自己对他发生 好感。""最可爱的小姐，"奥尔华绥说，"您可以放心，即使这是我自己的 儿子，并且对他十分敬重，我也决不会为这件事生您的气。小姐，正像您 说的，人不能左右自己的好恶，旁人更不能来操纵。皿啊，先生，"苏菲亚 说，"世人都称道您为人善良、伟大、仁慈，您说的每一个字都证明您对这 称誉可以当之无愧。您可以相信，倘若我不是看到将来必然会遭到悲惨的 命运，我是不会违抗父命的。""小姐，我真诚地相信您的话，"奥尔华绥回 答说，"并且由衷地祝贺您这种先见之明。由于您这番正当的违抗，您的确 避免了一场悲惨的命运！""奥尔华绥先生，”她大声说，"您讲得这么熨 帖，很少人能够体会。不过依我看来，如果我们对一个人毫无感情可言， 同这样的人一道生活势必十分痛苦。如果我们意识到一个人的优点，只是 自己不能爱他，这种痛苦说不定还要增加。要是我嫁了布利非先生的 话……""小姐，请恕我插一句嘴，"奥尔华绥回答说，"可是我不能容忍您
这一假设。魏斯顿小姐，请相信我这话：我从心坎里高兴一一高兴您逃脱
了这场厄运。我已经发现，害您受到令尊种种残酷迫害的那个家伙原来是 个坏蛋。皿哦，先生！ ”苏菲亚大声说，"您这话当然叫我很吃惊。皿小 姐，我也是大吃一惊的，"奥尔华绥说，"世人也都会吃惊的……然而我告 诉您的是实情。""我深深相信，"苏菲亚说，"奥尔华绥先生口里说出的只 能是实情……可是，先生，这消息来得这么突然，这么出人意外……您 说'已经发现'……但愿一切恶行都能被发现出来。""不久，您就会晓得事情 的经过了，"奥尔华绥大声说，"眼下，咱们不再提这个可憎的名字……我 另外要向您提一件重大的事。啊，魏斯顿小姐，我晓得您是多么可贵，我 也不肯轻易放弃和您结为姻亲的愿望……小姐，我有个近戚，一个我相信 在品格上和那家伙正相反的年轻人，而我要给他的产业也和我本来打算给 那个坏蛋的一样多。小姐，我可以希望您接见他一次吗？”苏菲亚沉默了一 会儿，然后回答说："奥尔华绥先生，我跟您完全赤诚相见。您的为人以及 您刚才对我的这番厚情，都要求我这样。我已经打定主意，目前决不听取 任何人的这种请求。我唯一的愿望就是重新得到我父亲的爱，并且再度替 他操持家务。我希望您成全我这个愿望。先生，我以及凡是认识您的人都 体验到您的仁厚心肠；凭这一点，我请求您一一我哀求您不要刚刚把我从 一种折磨中拯救出来，又使我陷入一种同样痛苦而徒然的折磨中去。""魏 斯顿小姐，"奥尔华绥说，"我决做不出这种事儿来。您要是这么下定决心 了，不管我那个亲属会多么痛苦，他也只得忍受这份失望。""奥尔华绥先 生，"苏菲亚回答说，"听您说起我并不认识的一一因而对方也不会熟悉我 的一个男人将感到的痛苦，我不禁要发笑了。""亲爱的小姐，"奥尔华绥大 声说，"对不起，我现在担心的倒是他和您太熟了，以致他以后很难安宁下 来。但凡男人有可能用诚挚、强烈、崇高的情感来爱女人的话，我深深相 信我这不幸的外甥就正是用这种情感爱着魏斯顿小姐的。皿您的一位外 甥！"苏菲亚回答说，"奥尔华绥先生，这可真叫人不解。我从来没听说过 他呢。""小姐，”奥尔华绥大声说，"您所没听说过的只不过他是我的外甥 这一事实，而我自己也是今天才晓得……他就是琼斯先生一一爱了您多年 的琼斯先生！他是我的外甥。""啊，琼斯先生是您的外甥！"苏菲亚嚷 道，"能是这样吗小姐，他的确是，"奥尔华绥回答说，"他是我亲妹妹 的儿子。我永远承认他是我的外甥，而且我这样做决不感到耻辱。我倒是 为过去对他的态度更感到惭愧，可是我对他的可贵品质正如我对他的身世 一样无知。真的，魏斯顿小姐，我曾经对他残酷过……确实如此。"说到这
里，这位好心人擦了擦眼泪，又沉吟了一下，然后继续说："没有您的帮 助，我永远也弥补不上他所遭受的一切……请相信，最可爱的小姐，我肯 定是十分重视这次的提亲，才会向尊贵的小姐开口。我晓得他犯过错误， 然而他内心深处是充满了善良的。相信我，小姐，确实是这样。"说到这 里，他停住了，仿佛等待答复。奥尔华绥这段突兀而惊人的话使苏菲亚心 情激动起来。她神志恢复过来一些之后，才回答说："先生，看来您为这一 发现感到十分高兴，我为它衷心向您祝贺。我毫不怀疑您将从这一发现中 得到您所预期的一切快慰。这位年轻人肯定具有无数的优良品质，这就足 以保证他一定会好好侍奉您这样一位舅父。""小姐，”奥尔华绥说，"我希 望他也具有足以使他成为一个好丈夫的品质。要是像您这样的小姐肯于俯 允的话，我相信在男子当中他定然是最倾心的……""奥尔华绥先生，"苏菲 亚回答说，"您一定得原谅我，我实在不能考虑这种请求。我深深相信琼斯 先生有许多优点，但是我永远也不会把他当作我的未婚夫来接待……凭人 格来起誓，我永远也不会。""对不起，小姐，"奥尔华绥嚷道，"根据我听 魏斯顿先生所说的，您这表示可叫我有些吃惊……如果那个年轻人荣幸地 得到过您的好感的话，但愿他没做出什么事使他失掉您的好感……也许有 人在您跟前歪曲了他，就像有人在我跟前做的一样。同一个坏人也许在到 处中伤他......请您相信，他决不是个凶手，像有人这么叫过他的。"“奥尔 华绥先生，"苏菲亚回答说，"我已经将我下定的决心告诉您了。我父亲告 诉您的话我并不以为怪。不管他怀有什么样的担心或惧怕，这并不是我引 起的一一我晓得自己的心。我一直恪守一个坚定不移的原则：不得他的同 意，我决不嫁人。我认为这是子女对父母应尽的责任。我希望不曾有任何 东西足以使我不再遵循这一原则。然而我并不认为做父母的有权强迫我们 嫁自己所不愿嫁的人。为了回避这种压力（我有理由担心有这种压力）， 我离开了我父亲的家，另找了个庇护的地方。这就是我全部经过的真相。 要是世人或者我父亲偏要去添枝加叶，我自己是问心无愧的。”"魏斯顿小 姐，"奥尔华绥嚷道，"您这番话真是令我钦佩。我佩服您的见地合情合 理，然而总感觉这里边还有文章。小姐，我很怕使您气恼。可是，难道迄 今我所听到看到的一切，都是梦幻吗？您既然为了一个男人而在令尊手里 吃了这么大苦头，对这人您难道能一直是毫无感情吗？""奥尔华绥先 生，"苏菲亚回答说，"我恳求您不要苦苦追问我为什么会这样……是的， 我的确吃了不少苦头；奥尔华绥先生，我不打算向您隐瞒什么……我要对
您十分坦率……我承认我曾经对琼斯先生有过好感……我相信……我晓得 我为这种好感吃了苦头……我姑姑和我父亲都给了我不少罪受。可是这已 经成为过去了。我希望您不要再追问下去，因为不管过去怎样，我已经下 定决心了。奥尔华绥先生，您的外甥有许多美德一一他有了不起的美德。 我完全相信他会为您增光，使您幸福。""小姐，但愿我也能使他幸福，"奥 尔华绥回答说，"可是我深深相信，在这一点上，只有您能做到。也正是由 于这种信念我才这么替他向您恳求。""先生，您受骗了，您真的受骗 了，”苏菲亚说，"我希望您不是受他的骗。骗了我就够了。奥尔华绥先 生，请您无论如何不要再同我纠缠这个问题。我很不愿意一一不，我决不 损害您对他的恩宠。我祝琼斯先生幸福。我衷心祝他幸福。我再对您说一 遍：不管在我心目中他有什么样的瑕疵，我深信他有许多良好的品质。我 并不否认过去的想法，然而那已经一去不复返了。眼下，我拒绝世上任何 人也不会像拒绝琼斯先生那么坚决。他的求婚并不比布利非先生的求婚更 中我的意。”
魏斯顿先生等了好半天会谈的结果，等得不耐烦了，这时就来到门外 偷听，听到他女儿最后这段心窝子话，他按捺不住了，就气冲冲地闯进门 去，嚷道："她这是扯谎！全他妈的是谎！都是由于那个该死的流氓琼斯； 要是她能得到那个小子，她立刻就会嫁给他的。"这时，奥尔华绥插嘴了。 他带些怒容对魏斯顿说："魏斯顿先生，你可没遵守诺言呀！你已经答应了 我决不使用任何强暴手段的。""答应是答应了，"魏斯顿嚷道，"能不用就 不用。可如今听这丫头撒起弥天大谎来啦……见鬼！她也不想想，她蒙得 了旁人，也能蒙住我吗？……不，不，我比你了解她先生，我不得不 告诉你，"奥尔华绥回答说，"从你对待这位小姐的态度来看，你似乎根本 不了解她。请恕我这样直言，不过根据咱们的交情，你自己的心愿，以及 当前的情势，这话还是应该讲的。魏斯顿先生，她是你的女儿，我认为她 替你们的家族带来了光彩。要是我会妒忌的话，我就宁可妒忌你有这样一 个女儿，甚于妒忌任何其他什么人。""哎呀！”乡绅嚷道，"我巴不得她是 你的一一我但愿能甩掉她这个包袱。""好朋友，"奥尔华绥说，"老实说， 你所抱怨的包袱全是自找的。这位小姐完全是值得信任的，你只要信任 她，那么我相信你就必然会是世上最幸福的父亲了。""我信任她？”乡绅嚷 道，"瞎扯淡！她什么都不依我，我能信任她什么？只要她肯顺着我的心思 同意这门亲事，那么你要我怎么信任她我就怎么信任她。""老街坊，"奥尔
华绥说，"你没有权利坚持要她这么同意。令媛准许你否定她的选择，天理 人情都认为此外你不应享受更多的权利了。皿准许我否定！ ”乡绅嚷 道，"好吧！好吧！我否定一个给你瞧瞧……给我滚，滚回你房里去，你这 个死顽固的……""真的，魏斯顿先生，"奥尔华绥说，"你对她确实太粗暴 了……我不能眼睁睁这么看着……你一定要、一定得对她和善一些。她值 得您用最温和的态度对待。""对，对，"乡绅说，"我晓得她值得什么。如 今她既然出去了，我让你看看她值得什么吧。先生，看吧，这是我的表亲 贝拉斯顿夫人来的一封信。承她告知，那小子又从监牢里放出来啦。信里 她劝我要好好看着这个丫头。哼，老街坊奥尔华绥，你可不晓得管个女儿 是什么滋味呢！”
乡绅最后夸耀了几句自己如何精明，话就谈完了。于是奥尔华绥先隆 重地讲了一段开场白之后，就把关于琼斯身世的全部发现，他对布利非的 震怒以及上几章里我们向读者揭示的一切情节，全对乡绅讲了。
性情过烈的人大半主见也并不深。所以魏斯顿一晓得奥尔华绥先生打 算立琼斯为嗣，立刻就热烈附和这位舅父对外甥的一切赞美，就像以前急 着要把苏菲亚嫁给布利非一样，如今他又同样急着要她和琼斯成亲。
这时，奥尔华绥先生又不得不插嘴了。他讲了刚才和苏菲亚交谈的经 过，并表示十分诧异。
魏斯顿沉默了片刻。这段叙述使他惊愕得两眼发直。最后，他嚷 道："街坊奥尔华绥，你说说这是咋回事儿？我敢发誓，过去这丫头是爱他 的。呸！我猜到啦，准得就像我用枪瞄中了一样。都怪我那妹妹。这丫头 爱上那个婊子养的勋爵了。我在我表亲贝拉斯顿夫人家里瞅见他俩在一起 过。准是那个勋爵把她搞得晕头转向了……妈的，我绝不让她嫁给那家 伙……我家里不收这些王公贵族。”
奥尔华绥这时说了很长一段话，再一次表示一定要避免采取任何强暴 措施，非常恳切地劝魏斯顿先生使用温和的办法，他保证这样做最能说服 他的女儿。然后他就告辞，回到密勒太太家去。临走的时候，魏斯顿恳切 央求他答应下午把琼斯先生带来，好让他"跟那位少爷和解"。奥尔华绥只好 首肯了。魏斯顿也答应在对待苏菲亚的态度上，一定遵循他的劝告，还 说："我也说不清是咋回事儿，妈的，奥尔华绥，每回你总能叫我完全照你 的意思办事，可是我的家业不比你的小呀，而且我和你一样是个保安官 哩。”
第十章
这部历史接近尾声了
奥尔华绥回到寓所，听说琼斯先生也刚刚来到，就赶紧走到一间空屋 子里，吩咐请琼斯先生单独来见他。
我们实在想不出什么情景比他们甥舅相会（读者不难设想，沃特尔太 太前一次访问琼斯的时候，已经把他自己身世的秘密全说给他听了）更热 烈、更动人的了。双方最初那阵悲喜交集之感是我根本无力描绘的，所以 我也不去尝试了。奥尔华绥把跪在他跟前的琼斯扶起来之后，拥抱着他， 嚷道："啊，我的孩子，我做得多么不对！多么委屈了你！我怎样才能弥补 过去对你所抱的那种恶毒而不公正的怀疑，以及从而使你遭受的痛苦 啊！皿现在我不是得到补偿了吗？ ”琼斯嚷道，"即使我的痛苦再大上+ 倍，如今不也得到充分的补偿了吗？啊，亲爱的舅父，您的仁厚，您的慈 爱压倒了我，征服了我，折杀了我！这阵狂喜来得这么汹涌澎湃，我简直 承受不了。啊，重新回到您跟前，重新得到您的恩宠，又能拜见您一一我 的伟大、崇高、慷慨的恩主的慈颜。""孩子，”奥尔华绥大声说，"我待你 确实太残忍了。"于是，他向琼斯说了一下布利非的种种诡计，并且再一次 表示心里很难过，由于受到那诡计的操纵，竟然那么虐待了他。"啊，可别 这么讲！"琼斯回答说，"您待我是宽厚的。再明达的人也会像您那样受蒙 蔽，而在这种蒙蔽下，您采取的正是最善良的人所必然采取的步骤。您老 人家在气头上还显示出您的仁厚。看来当时确是这样。我一切都仰赖您的 仁厚，而我是很不配的。您不要过于宽宏大量，那样会使我更加责备自 己。哎，舅父，我所受的惩罚不过是罪有应得。今后，我毕生的抱负就是 要做到不辜负目前您赐给我的幸福。亲爱的舅父，请您相信，我决没白白 受到惩罚。尽管我犯的罪很严重，我却不是死不回头的。感谢上帝，我借 此反省了一下我过去的生活。虽然我不能指控自己干过什么罪大恶极的 事，可是我察觉自己过去的糊涂和不正当的行为，多得简直忏悔不完，羞 愧无地。那些糊涂行为给我带来了可怕的后果，曾经差点儿把自己毁 掉。""我亲爱的孩子，"奥尔华绥回答说，"我非常高兴听你谈得这么通情 达理。我既然相信弄虚作假不是你的过失之一，（天哪，有人凭这一手竟 把我骗成什么样子了 ！）所以我可以立即相信你所说的一切。汤姆，你 看，处世不检点可以给人的品德（我晓得你是十分珍视品德的）造成多么
大的危害！谨言慎行确实是我们对自己应尽的责任。倘若我们轻率行事， 贻误了自己，那么也就难怪世人不对我们恪尽义务了；因为当一个人为自 己的灭亡打下基础，旁人就会高高兴兴帮他完成这个工程了。不过，你说 你已经认识到自己的错误，并且决心改正了。亲爱的孩子，我对这一点是 深信不疑的。因此，从今以后我决不再向你提起。你自己可要牢记，吸取 教训，将来好更可以避免重犯。不过，你还要记住（为了使你精神上没有 负担），由于轻举妄动而形成的过失和纯然出于奸诈邪恶的勾当之间是有 很大区别的。前者也许更容易毁灭一个人，然而倘若他能改正的话，他最 终就会被完全挽救过来；尽管世人不能立即对他谅解，到一定的时候是会 谅解他的。在回顾自己所避免的覆辙时，他还一定会感到一些快慰。可 是，孩子，奸诈邪恶的勾当一旦被揭发出来，那是不可救药的，它留下的 污点，不管过多久也洗刷不掉。人们的谴责声将追踪这个卑鄙的家伙，人 们的唾弃将使他在大庭广众之下丢尽颜面。倘若耻辱迫使他隐退起来，恐 怖感仍会笼罩在身边，就像怕鬼的孩子疲倦以后，离开同伴独自回房去睡 觉一样。这里，被他杀死的良心阴魂不散，仍然纠缠着他。精神上的安 宁，将像一个不义的朋友，弃他而去。不论他的眼睛转向哪里，都是一片 恐怖。回过头去，悔之晚矣的心情紧紧尾随着他。往前看，满目都是无可 挽救的绝望景象。最后，就像个判了刑的死囚，关在牢里。他憎恨现时的 处境，可又害怕将使他摆脱这一切的时刻到来。我的孩子，你尽可引以自 慰的是，你的情况不是这样的。你还应带着感激上帝的心来庆幸自己，因 为即使你犯的那类过失如果坚持下去，也会给你带来毁灭，上帝却及时叫 你省悟过来。你已经毅然与以往的过失诀别了，展现在你眼前的图景是： 幸福似乎已握在你掌中了。"琼斯听到这话，就长叹了一口气。当奥尔华绥 劝他不必如此时，他说："我什么也不想瞒您老人家。我担心由于我的胡作 非为，我遭到一个永难挽回的后果。啊，亲爱的舅父！我失去了一件珍 宝。""你不必再说了，"奥尔华绥回答说，"我坦率地告诉你吧，我晓得你 悲叹的是什么。我已经去见过那位小姐，并且同她谈起你来。为了证实你 对我所说的话都是真诚的，以及你立下的决心是坚定不移的，我要你一定 要在一件事上听我的话：不管那位小姐的决定符不符合你的利益，一定要 完全服从她的决定。由于想起来我就痛心的苦苦纠缠，她已经受够罪了。
我决不让她再受到我们家人的逼迫。我晓得她父亲会立刻为你的缘故又去 折磨她，正像以前为另一个人去折磨过她一样。可是我决计不让她再受囚
禁，再受虐待，再过那种惶惶不安的日子。""啊，我亲爱的舅父，"琼斯回 答说，"您尽管吩咐吧，我一定要尽遵命之道。您老人家可以相信，只有您 要我给苏菲亚以片刻的不安，我才会违命。不，既然我不幸已开罪于她， 以致没希望再获得她的饶恕，仅仅这一点，再加上我毛骨悚然地想到可能 给她造成的痛苦，就足以制止住我。当然，能称苏菲亚为'我的'，是上天所 能赐予我的最大的、也是目前所能额外增添的唯一幸福。然而这种幸福只 有她本人才能赐给我。皿孩子，"奥尔华绥大声说，"我不愿叫你妄存奢 望。你这件事恐怕未可乐观。她在表示不肯接受你的求婚时言词之激烈， 态度之坚决，是我所从来没见过的。她为什么会这样，道理也许你比我更 能说清楚。""啊，舅父！我是完全说得清楚的。"琼斯回答说，"我对她犯 下的罪过已经深重到没希望获得她的饶恕了。尽管我是犯了罪，然而不幸 我的罪过在她眼里比实际犯的还要严重十倍。啊，亲爱的舅父！我觉得我 所干下的糊涂事已经是无可挽救的了，您的一切仁慈也不能使我免于灾 难。”
这时，一个仆人进来禀告魏斯顿先生在楼下候见一一他急于要会琼 斯，已经等不到下午了。琼斯两眼泪汪汪的，他求舅父先去招待魏斯顿一 下，容他定一定神。这位善良的人答应了，就吩咐把魏斯顿先生请到客 厅，随后他自己也下楼去了。
密勒太太一听到琼斯一个人在房里（自从琼斯出狱以来，她还没见着 他），她就急忙跑进来，走到他跟前，热烈地祝贺他新认了亲舅父并且可 喜地得到了和解。她还说："我真希望在另外那件事情上也能向您道贺，可 是，亲爱的孩子，这么死说活说也不成的事我还没遇到过哩。”
琼斯带着些莫名其妙的神情问她指的是什么，她说："我去找您那位小 姐去了，我就把我女婿耐廷盖尔告诉我的话都对她说了。关于那封信，她 决不至于再有什么怀疑一一这一点我敢断定，因为我对她说，要是她愿意 的话，我女婿随时都可以起誓：写那封信完全是他想出的办法，信也是他 口授的。我对她说，写那封信的事更应当使您得到她的欢心，因为您那么 做完全是为了小姐，也明显地证明您已下定决心此后摒弃一切放荡行为； 而且自从在京城见到她以后，您再也没做过一件对她不忠实的事一一这话 我也许说过了头，可是上帝饶恕我，但愿您日后的行为将证明我没说错 话。我相信，凡是我能说的，我都说了，可是一点用也没有。怎么说她也 不动心。她说，顾念您年纪轻，她已经宽恕了您许多过失；可是她对于浪
荡行为表示得如此深恶痛绝，我简直再也没法开口了。我几次想替您辩 解，可是她那番正当的指责迎头堵住了我的嘴。哎，她真是位可爱的姑 娘。是我平生看到的最温柔、最通情达理的一位。她有一段话使我恨不得 要吻她一吻一一这样的话只有塞涅卡或者一位主教才说得出来。她对我 说：’太太，我曾经以为自己在琼斯先生身上发现了一颗善良的心，我承认 曾因此而由衷地敬重过他。但是全世界最善良的心也会被放纵无度的行径 败坏掉哇。对一个好心肠的浪荡子，我们至多也只能在鄙夷、憎恶中夹杂 几分惋惜。’这位小姐真是天仙一般，这一点儿也不假。""啊，密勒太 太！"琼斯回答说，"想到失掉这样一位天仙，我怎么受得了 ！""失掉？”密 勒太太大声说，"不，我希望您还没失掉她哩。下决心抛弃这种邪恶行径 吧，您还是有希望的。即使她怎么也说不动，还有一位年轻的上流女人 呢，一位标致可爱的女人，并且拥有一大笔资产，她爱您爱得要命。今天 早晨我才听说，我也告诉了魏斯顿小姐一一而且我说得离事实又远了些， 因为我对她说您已经回绝了她。不过，我确实认为您会回绝她的。这儿我 得给您点儿安慰：当我对苏菲亚小姐提到那个女人（也就是漂亮的寡妇亨 特太太）的名字的时候，我看出她的脸色刷的一下白了；可是等我说到您 回绝了的时候，我敢起誓，她脸上一下子又涨得通红。下面就是她的原 话：’我不否认，我相信他对我是有些情意的。
这时，魏斯顿进来，打断了他们的谈话一一尽管奥尔华绥对这位乡绅 有一种奇妙的慑服的力量，可是连这力量也无法再把他挡在门外了。
魏斯顿立刻走到琼斯跟前，嚷道："汤姆老伙计，见到你我真是满心地 高兴！过去的事儿咱们就都忘掉吧。我不是存心侮辱你，因为奥尔华绥晓 得一一不，你自己也晓得，我是把你当成另一个人啦。我既然没存什么恶 意，说上一两句粗话算得了啥？咱们基督教徒都得互相原谅，不能什么事 老记住啊。""先生，"琼斯说，"我永远也不会忘记我欠您的许多情分。至 于您有什么得罪我的地方，我这还是头一回听说。皿好，咱们握握手 吧，"魏斯顿说，"你是全英国顶痛快、顶老实的小伙子。跟我一道来吧， 我立刻带你去会你的意中人。"这时，奥尔华绥上前拦住了。不论作舅父的 还是外甥，乡绅都劝不动，经过一番争执，他只好同意下午再领琼斯去会 苏菲亚一一那时，奥尔华绥一方面为了安慰琼斯，一方面也是为了满足魏 斯顿的愿望，答应到他家去用茶。
接着，他们谈得很畅快，这倘若发生在早些时候，我们一定会写出来 以娱读者。可是眼下我们只来得及写重大事情，所以这里只告诉大家，谈 妥了下午拜访的事后，魏斯顿先生就告辞回寓所了。
第十一章
这部历史更接近尾声了
魏斯顿先生走后，琼斯对奥尔华绥先生和密勒太太讲起，他是由两位 贵族从狱里保释出来的。他们在两位外科大夫以及耐廷盖尔先生的一位朋 友的陪同下，去见判他入狱的那个法官，经外科大夫宣誓证明伤者已经完 全脱离险境，然后才被释放。
两位贵族中间，他只见过一位，而且也仅仅见了一面。可是另一位却 叫他大吃一惊。他要求琼斯原谅他对他的一次冒犯，并且说，那完全出于 他当时并不晓得琼斯是谁。
后来琼斯才晓得了事实真相：费拉玛勋爵曾按照贝拉斯顿夫人的主 意，雇了一名中尉去把琼斯当作流浪汉抓去当水兵。这位中尉来向勋爵报 告这件事（已见前面）的时候，从各方面很替琼斯先生的行为举止说好 话，竭力说勋爵必是搞错人了，因为琼斯一定是个上流人。这位勋爵对待 荣誉是一丝不苟的，他决不肯做一件世人会一致加以谴责的事，就后悔不 该依从那个主意。
一两天后，费拉玛勋爵碰巧和那位爱尔兰贵族一道吃饭。席间谈到那 场决斗的时候，爱尔兰贵族就把费兹帕特利的人品向同席的人讲了一一他 谈的并不完全公正，尤其涉及费兹帕特利太太的地方。他说，这位太太是 世上最无辜、最受屈的女人，并且说他只是出于同情才为她主持公道。然 后，他表示打算第二天早晨要到费兹帕特利的寓所去访问，劝他要是可能 的话同意和他的妻子分居，因为她担心倘若又回到自己丈夫的支配下，就 有性命之忧。费拉玛勋爵同意陪他一道去，好更多地了解一下有关琼斯以 及那次决斗的情况一一他对自己所扮演的角色是很不安的。勋爵刚一表示 愿意协助搭救费兹帕特利太太，另外那位贵族就热烈赞同，他十分重视费 拉玛勋爵的威势，认为他的威势大大有助于使费兹帕特利就范。这一点， 也许果如他所料，因为那个倒霉的爱尔兰人一看到两位贵族全出来替他的 妻子说话，就让步了。分居的条款拟好之后，双方就签了字。
费兹帕特利听了沃特尔太太的话之后，已经完全相信，那次在厄普顿 琼斯和他的妻子丝毫没有瓜葛。由于这一点或是旁的原因，他对那件事已 经不再介意了，以致在费拉玛勋爵面前说了琼斯许多好话，把错处全怪在 自己头上，说对方的举止很像一位上流人和体面人。勋爵进一步追问起琼
斯先生的情况时，费兹帕特利告诉他琼斯是一位上流巨绅的外甥一一这话 是沃特尔太太见到道林之后刚刚对他说的。
费拉玛勋爵不再把琼斯看作情敌了（因为此刻他已经放弃了对苏菲亚 的全部念头），同时，觉得理应尽所有的力量来补偿一下自己大大亏待了 的那位绅士，就在从费兹帕特利和外科大夫口中确知伤势不至于有性命危 险之后，决定出面保释琼斯先生。于是，他就怂恿那位爱尔兰贵族陪他来 到囚禁琼斯的地方。见到琼斯时，他的举止态度就像前面所叙述过的那 样。
奥尔华绥一回到寓所，就马上把琼斯叫到他房里，然后把他从沃特尔 太太那里听到的以及从道林口中所发现的一切，全对他讲了。
琼斯听了非常惊讶，也很难过，但并没作任何表示。这时，布利非先 生派人来请示舅父有没有空，他想来见他。奥尔华绥愣了一下，脸上变得 刷白，然后，用一种我相信他从没用过的语调吩咐仆人告诉布利非，他根 本不认识他。"亲爱的舅父，您考虑一下！"琼斯用发抖的声音嚷道。"我已 经考虑过了，"奥尔华绥回答说，"而且我要你亲自去替我回复那个坏蛋。 再也没有比他曾经恶毒地企图加以毁灭的人更适宜于通知他这个将使他自 己遭受毁灭的判词的了。""亲爱的舅父，"琼斯说，"对不起，如果您稍微 思索一下，我相信您就会同意旁人去通知要比我去强。同样一句话，出自 旁人的口也许只是公理，出自我的口，就会成为一种侮辱；侮辱谁呢？我 的亲兄弟一一您的外甥。况且他待我并不是那么狠毒一一那就确实比他做 的任何事情更不可恕了。财产会诱使有些心地并不很坏的人做出不公道的 事来，可是侮辱只能来自一副阴狠歹毒的心肠，没有任何诱惑作为借口。 所以舅父，我恳求您别在这样气头上对他采取什么行动。亲爱的舅父，您 想一想，当初您对我下判决之前也还容许我申辩过。"奥尔华绥沉默了片 刻，然后搂住琼斯，泪如泉涌，对他说："啊，我的孩子！这么些年来，我 对你这种仁厚心肠竟然熟视无睹！”
这时际，密勒太太刚好走进房来一一她先轻轻敲了敲门，可是里边没 听到。看到琼斯被搂在他舅父怀里，这个可怜的女人悲喜交集，跪倒在 地，为当前的情景狂喜得连声感谢上帝。然后她奔到琼斯跟前，热烈地拥 抱着他，嚷道："我最亲爱的朋友，为了这个幸福的日子，我要向您祝贺一 千遍，一万遍。"接着，她对奥尔华绥先生也同样这么祝贺了。"是的，是 的，密勒太太，"他回答说，"我实在是说不出的高兴。"三人又各自说了些
兴高采烈的话，密勒太太就请他们到客厅去用饭，她说有几位幸福的人已 经聚在那里了一一原来正是耐廷盖尔先生和他的新娘子，以及他的堂妹哈 丽特和她的新郎。
奥尔华绥表示抱歉不能同他们一道用饭，说他已经给自己和他的外甥 要了一点东西送到房里去吃，因为他们有许多私事要商量。不过他答应这 位好心的女人，他和琼斯都愿意来参加她的晚宴。
然后，密勒太太又问起应该怎么处置布利非。她说："我这寓所里住着 这么个坏蛋，老实说我是放心不下的。"奥尔华绥说他也跟她一样，为这件 事放心不下。"啊！"她大声说，"要是那样的话，就把这件事交给我来办 吧。放心，我准能立刻把他轰出大门。楼下有两三个粗壮小伙子呢。""用 不着动武，"奥尔华绥嚷道，"只要您肯把我的话传给他，我相信他准会自 动走掉的。""我还能不肯吗？”密勒太太说，"我一辈子再没有比做这件事 更心甘情愿的了。"这时琼斯插进来说，他仔细考虑过了，要是奥尔华绥先 生同意的话，最好还是由他去通知。他说："舅父，我已经体会了您的意 旨，请准许我亲自去告诉他。"随后，他又说："我恳求您想一想，要是这 么突然地硬把他赶到绝路上去，后果有多么可怕。唉，让那个可怜人在目 前的处境下死掉是多么不适宜呀！"琼斯这段话丝毫也没说动密勒太太。她 边嚷边走出房去："琼斯先生，您为人太厚道了，厚道得简直不适宜活在这 个世界上。"然而琼斯的话却给了奥尔华绥先生更深刻的印象。"我的好孩 子，"他说，"我对你心地的善良和头脑的敏锐同样感到惊奇。上帝的确不 允许把这个坏人悔过自新的条件和时间都剥夺了。那种想法的确是可怕 的。你见他去吧，怎么办你自己斟酌。不过，不要让他存着我会饶恕他的 希望。对于恶行，我的宽恕只能在教义所规定的限度以内，而那既不包括 对他施惠，也不要求我们还和他有什么往来。”
琼斯上楼来到布利非的房里。看到布利非的情景，怜悯之心不禁油然 而生一一尽管旁的许多人见了不会引起那样的同情。布利非倒在床上，悲 痛绝望，泪流满面；但是他流的并不是悔罪之泪，以致能从我们心灵上洗 去由于受到蛊惑或一时失去警惕而犯的那种违反我们本性的罪过一一人们 由于软弱，这样的事有时是会发生的，甚至好人也在所难免。不，布利非 流的是盗匪在刑车里出于畏惧而流的那种眼泪，这种由本身安危而引起的 悲痛，连在最残酷成性的人中也是习见的。
把这两人会见的情景描绘下来是既不愉快，也枯燥无味的。只要说一 句琼斯的态度和善过了头就够了。在他转达舅父要布利非必须当晚离开的 决定之前，他先用能想得到的一切言词来鼓舞、安慰情绪低沉的布利非。 他表示需要什么钱他都愿意供给，保证一定不去计较过去布利非加给他的 一切损害，今后一定设法和他住在一起，把他当手足看待，同时还想尽一 切办法来促使舅父跟他和解。
布利非最初阴沉不语，心里盘算着是不是还应该把一切抵赖掉；可是 后来发觉铁证如山，抵赖不得，他只好俯首认罪了。于是，他痛哭流涕地 央求他哥哥的宽恕，匍匐在地，吻琼斯的脚。总之，此刻他的卑躬屈节正 像他以前的穷凶极恶一样不同凡响。
看到布利非这副十足的奴才相，琼斯不禁感到鄙夷，他脸上也略微表 露出来。他尽快地把他弟弟从地上扶了起来，劝他多拿出点丈夫气来承受 自己的遭遇，同时重复他的诺言，一定尽一切力量来减轻他的痛苦。听了 这话，布利非又一再表示自己多么不配承受，口口声声向琼斯千恩万谢。 在他明确地说要立即搬到旁处去住以后，琼斯就回到他舅父跟前。
除了其他一些事情，如今奥尔华绥还告诉了琼斯那五百镑钞票的下 落。"我已经请教过一位律师，"他说，"使我大吃一惊的是，他告诉我，法 律对这种欺骗行为并没规定任何惩罚。老实说，我一想到这家伙对你的忘 恩负义，就觉得跟他比起来，强盗倒该算得清白无辜了。”
"哎呀！"琼斯说，"他能干得出这种事来吗？一一听到这件事太使我震 惊了。我还以为世上再没有比他更诚实的人呢。不过这么一大笔款子对他 也确实是难以抵抗的诱惑，以前经他手的较小的款子并没出过毛病。真 的，亲爱的舅父，您得容许我把这件事看作意志薄弱，而不是忘恩负义。 我深深相信那个可怜的人是爱护我的，并且曾替我做过几件我永远也不会 忘怀的好事。我甚至相信他对那次行为也已懊悔了，因为就在一两天以 前，正当我的案子陷于最绝望的境地时，他到狱里来探望我，表示随便我 需要多少钱，他都愿意帮助我。舅父，请您设想一下，对于一个曾经饱尝 贫困的人，这样一笔足以使他和他的全家此后再也没有冻馁之虞的款子， 该是多么大的诱惑啊！”
"孩子，"奥尔华绥嚷道，"你把忠恕之道行得未免过分了。这样错误的 仁慈不仅是软弱，而且近乎有失公道，因为它助长罪恶，从而贻害社会。 我也许可以宽恕这个家伙的不诚实，可是对他的忘恩负义，我决不能宽
恕。我还得告诉你，当我们容许以诱惑为理由来赦免不诚实的行为本身 时，我们是做到了我们所应做到的公道和仁慈。我承认我已经做到这点 了，因为当我出席大陪审团的时候，我曾多次对盗匪的命运表示同情，只 要案情里有任何可以申请减罪的地方，我必然替被告向审判长申请。然而 如果不诚实之外，还附带着更加恶劣的罪名，像残暴、凶杀、忘恩负义等 等，再去同情或宽恕，那就成为过失了。我深深相信这家伙是个坏蛋，他 应该受到惩罚一一至少也要受到我所能给予的惩罚。”
他这话是用十分严峻的声调说的，琼斯觉得不宜于作什么表示；况且 和魏斯顿先生约会的时间眼看就到了，仅仅来得及换换衣服了。所以他们 这次的交谈到此就告结束。琼斯回到另一房间去，巴特里奇正按照吩咐伺 候他更换衣服。
打从那个可喜可贺的发现以来，巴特里奇几乎一直也没见到他的主 人。可怜此人的一腔欢喜藏又藏不住，可说又说不出。他举止像个疯子， 帮琼斯换衣的时候闹了许多差错，就跟我看到小丑哈勒昆四在舞台上穿衣时 一样。
可是他的记忆力却一点也没减弱。他想起许多有关这件喜事的迹象和 征兆，有些他当时就指出了，但大部分是此刻才记起的。他也没忘记在遇 到琼斯的头天晚上所做的那个梦。最后，他说："我一向对您说，我心头有 一种预感，那就是迟早您会使我时来运转。"琼斯说，就像关于他自己的一 切预兆都应验了一样，巴特里奇的这个预感也一定会实现。这话使得已经 为主人的事喜得手舞足蹈的巴特里奇更加快活起来。
第十二章
离结尾更近了
这时，琼斯已经换好衣服，就陪他舅父拜访魏斯顿先生去了。他确实 是个世间少见的美男子，仅仅凭他的相貌就足以使大多数女人倾倒。不 过，我们希望本书已经表明过造物在塑造琼斯的时候，并未单凭外表（有 时它是这样）来展示它的匠心。
尽管苏菲亚还在生气，她还是把自己打扮得分外出色（道理何在，请 妇女读者们自去推敲吧）。她长得真是如花似玉，连奥尔华绥见了都不禁 对魏斯顿小声说，他相信苏菲亚是世界上最美的姑娘了。魏斯顿小声（可 是在场的都听到了）回答说："那么汤姆就更称心了，他不跟她胡折腾一气 才怪！"苏菲亚听了羞得满面通红，汤姆则脸色惨白，恨不得找个地缝钻下 去。
茶桌刚刚收拾干净，魏斯顿就把奥尔华绥拽出房间，说有重要事情相 告，并且马上得单独同他谈了，免得忘掉。
如今，房里只剩这对情人了。我想许多读者必然都会感到奇怪：何以 当他们需要冒着千难万险来交谈的时候倒有那么多话可谈，当重重障碍阻 隔着他们的时候倒那么急于投入对方的怀抱；而此刻他们想说什么或做什 么都可以随心所欲的时候，他们却一动不动地沉默了一阵子。一个眼光不 很犀利的旁观者，很可以认为他们相互十分冷漠。然而不管看来是多么离 奇，他们确实是这样：两人都眼望着地坐在那里，好几分钟彼此默默无 语。
这期间，有一两回琼斯先生想说点什么，然而总说不出口，只能嗫嚅 着一一或者不如说，叹息出几个不相连贯的字儿。终于，苏菲亚一半出于 可怜琼斯的狼狈，一半也为了故意要避开她明知道琼斯竭力想谈的话题， 就说：
"先生，这件事真相大白之后，您当然是世上最幸运的人了。皿小 姐，"琼斯叹了口气说，"我惹得您对我这么气恼，您真的还能认为我这么 幸运吗至于这一层，"她说，"先生，您比任何人都更清楚那是不是您 咎由自取。""的确，小姐，"他回答说，"我的一切过失您最明白。密勒太 太已经把全部真相都告诉您了。啊，我的苏菲亚！难道我永远也没希望邀 得您的宽恕了吗琼斯先生，"她说，"我想我可以信赖您自己的公道之
心，那么您就对自己的行为下个判决吧。皿啊，小姐，"他回答说，"我向 您讨的不是公道而是仁慈。我晓得论公道，我是有罪的一一然而并不是由 于我给贝拉斯顿夫人写的那封信。关于那封信，我庄重地向您宣誓，告诉 您的全是实情。"然后，他着重强调了耐廷盖尔所提供的保证，万一贝拉斯 顿夫人出人意外地接受了他的求婚时，就让他有一个斩断关系的可靠借 口。不过琼斯承认让这样一封信落到她手里是大失检点。他说："就这封信 在您身上所起的作用来说，我已经付出很高的代价了。""关于那封信，我 只能照您所讲的相信，也决不认为有旁的情况。我想从我的态度您也可以 明白看出，我并不怎么重视那封信。可是，琼斯先生，难道您做下的事还 不够使我生您的气吗？刚刚在厄普顿发生过那样的事没多久，您又和另一 个女人勾搭上了一一我还以为您真像您自己所假装的那样，为我而肠断 呢。您的行径真是叫人难解。我能够相信您向我表示的爱情是真实的吗？ 或者，即使我相信了您，那么跟这样一个朝三暮四的人在一起生活，我能 确保自己的幸福吗啊，我的苏菲亚，"他嚷道，"对于人类胸膛里所能 燃起的最纯洁的爱情，请您不要怀疑它的真挚吧。想想看，最可崇拜的人 儿，我当时是处在怎样可悲的境地，陷入怎样的绝望之中！我的苏菲亚， 倘若当初我能抱最渺茫的奢望，认为有朝一日我还能像今天这样拜倒在您 的脚前的话，那么任何女人也无法在我心上引起哪怕一点点最重视贞洁的 人会加以非议的邪念。对您朝三暮四！啊，苏菲亚！要是您肯宽大为怀， 饶恕过去的事，那么就不要因担心未来而产生种种折磨人的忧虑，从而不 再对我发慈悲。再没有比我的悔过更真诚的了。啊，让我重新回到您的可 爱的怀抱一一我的天堂中来吧。""琼斯先生，"她回答说，"一个罪人真诚 悔改了，是可以得到宽恕的，然而只有能够绝对判断您的真诚的上帝，才 有权给予这种宽恕。凡人是可以受骗的，而且也没有什么万无一失的办法 来防止。不过，想来您也必料到，即便您的悔过打动了我的心，要使我宽 恕您，起码我也非得到关于您的真诚最有力的证明不可。""凡是我能做到 的，就请吩咐吧，"琼斯热切地说。"时间，"她回答说，"琼斯先生，只有 时间才能使我相信您是真正悔过自新，决心抛弃那些邪恶行径一一要是我 估量您有可能坚持不改的话，我会因而厌恶您的。""您可别那么估量，"琼 斯嚷道，"我跪下来央求您，请您信任我，我将以毕生的努力来使自己值得 您信任。""那么，"她说，"就请您用毕生的一部分时间来向我证明您是值 得信任的吧。我想我已经跟您讲得很清楚，什么时候我认为您赢得了我的
信任，我就会信任您。先生，经过以往这一切，难道您还期待我相信您空 口许下的诺言吗？"
琼斯回答说："不要光凭空口诺言就相信我。我还有更好的保证一一足 以担保我永远忠实于您。那只要看上一眼，就不容置疑的了。皿是什么 呢？”苏菲亚带点惊讶说。"可爱的天仙，我指给您看，"琼斯嚷着，抓住她 的手，把她带到镜子跟前。"就在这儿。瞧瞧这个可爱的人儿，那脸蛋儿， 那身材，那双眼睛，和透过眼睛而闪烁着的心灵。一个即将拥有这一切的 男人，还能够朝三暮四吗？决不会的！我的苏菲亚，就是多利蒙就是罗 切斯特勋爵见了，也永不会变心的。您只要用任何一个旁人的眼光来看看 您自己，您就决不会怀疑我这话了。"苏菲亚涨红了脸，露出一丝微笑，但 又硬皱起眉头说："如果要我根据过去来判断未来的话，那么只要您看不到 我的身影，心里也就不会再有我了，正如我一走出这个房间，镜子里就不 会再有我的身影一样。皿我指着老天一一指着一切神明起誓，”琼斯 说，"您的身影从来也没离开过我的心。您以女性的纤细感情是难以理解我 们男人的粗鄙的，您也不能明白某一种风流勾当在我们心上是多么不留影 踪。"苏菲亚十分庄重地回答说："我是不会这么区别的；我也决不嫁给一 个不能学得文雅到跟我一样不会这么区别的男人。""我一定去学，"琼斯 说，"我已经学会了。自从我有了娶我的苏菲亚为妻的希望那一刻起，我就 学会了。从那一刻起，所有旁的女人都既不能使我动情欲，也不能引起我 的爱慕。""可这只能让时间来证明，"苏菲亚说，"琼斯先生，现在您的景 况改变了，我对这种改变确实感到+分高兴。如今，您有的是机会接近 我，使我相信您的想法也改变了。""啊，我的天仙，"琼斯嚷道，"我该怎 样感激您对我的仁厚呀！您真的肯承认从我交的好运中感到一份高兴 吗？……相信我，相信我吧，小姐，只是仰赖您，我这番好运才成为甜滋 滋的，这要归功于您所赐予我的那份宝贵的希望。……啊！我的苏菲亚， 但愿实现这希望的日子不是很遥远。……我一定完全听从您的吩咐，决不 敢超出您所允许的范围强求什么。可是请容我央求您指定一个为时不久的 期限来考验我吧。啊，请告诉我几时我才能指望您相信我的爱情是极其真 挚的呢琼斯先生，"她说，"既然我出于自愿同您谈到这般程度，我不 想让您再来逼我。不，我是不受逼的。""啊，苏菲亚，不要那么狠狠地望 着我。"他嚷道，"我不会一一也不敢逼您。……不过，至少容我央求您还 是订个期限吧。啊，您想想看，情人的心是多么焦急呀。”"也许一年
吧……”她说。"啊，我的苏菲亚！ ”他嚷道，"您指定的简直是千年万载 呀。""也许会比那短一些，"她说，"不要这么啰嗦下去了。如果您对我的 爱情真是像我所愿望的那样，我想此刻您总可以安心了。""安心！"琼斯 说，"苏菲亚，不要用这般冷淡的字眼来形容令人欢跃的幸运吧。……啊， 多么令人神往的憧憬啊！我是不是可以确信那幸福的日子将要来临？到那 时，我就能称您为我的苏菲亚了 ；到那时，就再也没有恐惧了 ；到那时， 我就能由于使我的苏菲亚幸福而感到亲切、巨大、深远、狂烈的喜 悦……""先生，"她说，"这个日子确实是由您自己来决定的。""啊，我亲 爱的圣洁的天仙，"他嚷道，"您这句话真使我欢喜得发了疯。……但是我 必须一一我一定要感谢如此悦耳地宣示了我这份幸福的嘴唇。"于是，他就 把苏菲亚搂在怀里，用他以前从没敢用过的热情吻了她。
这当儿，站在门外偷听了一阵的魏斯顿闯了进来，用他打猎时的嗓音 和话语嚷道："逮住她，小伙子，扑过去，逮住她。……对啦，心肝宝贝， 啊，就这么办！怎么，全说停当了吧？她给日子了吗，小伙子？是明天， 还是后天？我打定主意啦，顶多是后天，再推迟一分一秒也不行。""先 生，我求求您，"琼斯说，"别因为我的缘故引起……""哦，求求我……"魏 斯顿嚷道，"我本来以为你这小伙子的性子要烈得多，决不会任凭这'I'头片 子耍她那一套。……对你说吧，她满嘴都是瞎扯。见鬼！她巴不得今儿晚 上就进洞房哩。苏菲，我说的可是实情？喏，坦白吧，一辈子你就这回说 个老实话吧。怎么，你哑巴啦？咋不开腔呀爹，您既然好像那么清楚 我的想法，”苏菲亚说，"我干什么还来坦白呢？""乖丫头，”他大声 说，"这么说，你同意了	不，爹，”苏菲亚说，"我并没同意。""那么明
天你不肯嫁给他，后天也不肯爹，"她说，"我确实没这种意思。""可 是我晓得你为啥不肯，”魏斯顿说，"就是因为我叫你往东，你非往西不 可，好折磨你的老子，惹他生气。""先生，请容许我……”琼斯想要插 嘴。"告诉你说，你是个脓包，"魏斯顿嚷道，"我不让她跟你往来的时候， 她又是叹气，又是哭哭啼啼，成天愁眉苦脸，偷偷写信；如今我赞成你 啦，她又不答应起来了。没旁的，她就是要跟我死作对。她就是要不听老 子的话，不听我的管教一一事情就是这样。横下心就是不听我的吩咐，跟 我顶牛。皿爹，那么您要我做些什么呢？ ”苏菲亚嚷道。"我要你做什 么？”魏斯顿说，"我要你立刻把手伸给他。""好吧，爹，"苏菲亚说，"我 听您的话。琼斯先生，我把手伸给您了。""那么你答应明天早晨跟他成亲
吗？”魏斯顿说。"就照您吩咐的，"她大声说。"那么明天早晨咱们就办喜 事啦，"他嚷道"爹，既然您乐意明天早晨办，那么就明天早晨办吧，"苏菲 亚说。于是，琼斯就跪下来，在狂喜中吻着苏菲亚的手。这时，魏斯顿在 房里手舞足蹈，然后嚷起来："奥尔华绥究竟他妈的哪儿去啦？这儿正有事 要办，他却在外头跟那个该死的道林律师聊起来了！"说着，他就跑出去找 奥尔华绥，正好让这对情人又单独享受了几分钟的温存。
可是没过多久他就同奥尔华绥一道回来了，嘴里说着："你要不信的 话，可以问问她本人。苏菲，你是不是已经同意明天跟他成亲了？皿爹， 这是您的命令，”苏菲亚嚷道，"我不敢违抗呀。皿小姐，"奥尔华绥嚷 道，"我只希望我的外甥能不辜负您这番厚意，但愿他能像我一样永远不忘 记您给舍下带来的光荣。同您这样端丽、这样卓越的一位小姐联姻，就是 英国最显贵的家族也要引以为荣。""这话有理，"魏斯顿嚷道，"不过，要 是我随她去拖拖拉拉，也许你还得有些日子才享受到这份光荣哩。还是我 迫不得已使出一点儿老子的威风她才就范的哪。""先生，”奥尔华绥嚷 道，"我希望不一一我希望这当中没有丝毫的强制。皿瞧瞧，”魏斯顿嚷 道，"你愿意的话可以试试叫她改口。苏菲，答应下的事情你打心里反悔了 吗不，爹，我不反悔，"苏菲亚回答说，"凡是我为琼斯先生而答应下 的事，我相信我永远都不反悔。""那么，外甥，"奥尔华绥大声说，"我衷 心向你祝贺，我看你是男人中间最幸福的了。小姐，请您也准许我为您道 喜。我毫不怀疑您以身相许的这个人一定会珍视您那卓绝的品德才慧，并 且尽最大的努力使自己对得起这一切。""最大的努力！"魏斯顿嚷道，"我 敢担保，他一定会的。喂，奥尔华绥，我用五镑跟你赌一克朗，不出九个 月咱们准得抱个孙孙。可是先告诉我你想来点什么：葡萄酒、香槟还是别 的？朱庇特在上，咱们今儿晚上得痛喝它一通。""实在对不起，"奥尔华绥 说，"我和我的外甥都没料到他的幸福这么快就来到了，我们事先另外有了 个约会。""约会！"乡绅说，"那可不成！不管什么事，今儿晚上我也不放 你走。哈利爵士在上，非在我这儿吃晚饭不可。""好街坊，一定得请你多 原谅！"奥尔华绥回答说，"我已经郑重地答应人家了，你晓得我向来是不 肯失信于人的。""那么，请问，"乡绅嚷道，"你是跟谁约下的？"于是，奥 尔华绥就告诉了他，并把同席的人也说了。"见鬼！"魏斯顿说，"我跟你 去，苏菲亚也一道去！反正今儿晚上我跟你摽上了。而且把汤姆跟我这丫
头分开也太残忍了。"奥尔华绥欣然同意了这个提议。苏菲亚在她父亲私下 里答应绝口不提她的婚事之后，也表示愿意前往。
末章
这部历史至此完结
那天下午，小耐廷盖尔按照事先约好的看望他父亲去了。老先生接见 他时的态度比他预料的要和善得多。他在那儿还遇见了他的叔父一一他是 为了寻找他那新婚的女儿而回到京城来的。
对这位年轻绅士来说，堂妹的婚姻真是一大幸事。原来在子女教育问 题上，他父亲和他叔父之间一直进行着无尽无休的争论，相互都瞧不起对 方所采用的办法。所以如今双方都竭力掩饰自己的孩子所犯的过失，强调 对方子女婚事的不当。正是由于老耐廷盖尔先生很想在子女教育问题上压 倒自己的弟弟，又加上奥尔华绥对他讲了许多道理，才大大扭转了他的看 法。因此，老先生见到他的儿子时满面春风，甚至答应到密勒太太的寓所 来同他共进晚餐。
至于小耐廷盖尔先生的叔父呢，他确实非常溺爱自己的女儿，所以没 费多大事就促使他同他女儿和解了。他一从侄子口中得到女儿和女婿的住 址，就说要马上去找她。找到的时候，女儿刚要跪下，他立刻就扶起她 来，用使所有看到的人都深为感动的爱抚把她搂在怀里。不到一刻钟，他 就同女儿女婿和解得宛如他们的婚事是他一手操办的。
奥尔华绥先生一行正是在这种情势下来到密勒太太的寓所的。这位太 太一看到苏菲亚，立即猜到全部经过，这就使得她的快乐更加圆满起来。 由于她对琼斯有着深挚的友情，继她女儿婚姻的美满结局之后，琼斯的事 也给她增添了不少快乐。
友朋相聚一堂而在座的人人都像当前这几位这么皆大欢喜的，我想一 定是不多见。其中，小耐廷盖尔的父亲心情没有旁人那么畅快，因为尽管 他由于很疼爱自己的儿子，又听到奥尔华绥那番有分量的话，以及前边提 到过的其他考虑，而同意了这门亲事，可是他对儿子的选择终归不十分满 意。也许苏菲亚的在场还多少加深了他这种惆怅，因为他心里不时念叨 着：不然的话，他儿子说不定还可以娶到这位小姐或者类似她的人哩。使 他这么懊悔不已的并不是苏菲亚在容貌或聪慧上闪烁出的光彩，而是她父 亲箱笼里的金银财宝；想起那些，他真是垂涎三尺。他所不甘心的是他的 儿子娶下密勒太太的姑娘，却牺牲了那些可爱的东西。
两位新娘子都很漂亮，可是在光艳照人的苏菲亚的对比下，她们显得 黯然失色了。要不是她们两个生性极为善良，心里还难免会妒忌苏菲亚 呢，因为两人的丈夫都几乎目不转睛地望着苏菲亚一一她像一位坐在那里 受诸臣朝拜的女王，或者说，犹如一位受四方顶礼膜拜的天仙。然而这种 膜拜是自发的，并不是她硬逼的，因为苏菲亚在谦恭有礼以及和蔼可亲 上，也与其他美德同样卓绝。
这一晚是在真正的欢快中度过的。人人感到幸福，而最感到幸福的是 以前最不幸的人。往日的苦难和恐怖使得他们当前的欢乐更加甜滋滋的 ――倘若没有这种比较，即使最美满的爱情、最亨通的财运，滋味也不会 那么甜的。可是当人们感受的快乐很不寻常，尤其又是在饱经挫折之后， 往往会沉默无语；快乐是蕴藏在心里，而不是挂在嘴上。从外表看来，这 些人中间琼斯和苏菲亚的兴头似乎最差了。魏斯顿见了非常不耐烦，一再 朝他们嚷着："小伙子，咋不开腔呀？干吗还愁眉苦脸的！ 丫头，你的舌头 哪儿去啦？再喝一杯。非再喝一杯不可。"为了替女儿助兴，乡绅还不时唱 一支关于出嫁后就不再是处女了的快活小调。倘若不是奥尔华绥先生时而 用眼色，时而用"嗨，魏斯顿先生！"拦住他，乡绅甚至还会把那个话题谈 下去，直到使苏菲亚窘得走出房去呢。魏斯顿确也曾开始争论，并坚持自 己有权爱和女儿讲什么话就讲什么话，可是座中没人附和他这意见，过一 阵他只好安静下来。
尽管受到这点约束，魏斯顿对于宾主欢聚一堂还是感到很高兴，他一 定要大家次日再到他的寓所来聚会，他们也应约而至。美丽的苏菲亚悄悄 地就做了新娘，这时她以主妇身份来主持宴会一一或者用上流社会的话 说，就是出面迎纳宾客。原来那天早晨她已经和琼斯在民法博士会馆的小 教堂里举行了婚礼，参加的只有奥尔华绥先生、魏斯顿先生和密勒太太。
苏菲亚再三恳求她父亲，此外不要让来赴宴的任何客人晓得已经举行 了婚礼。她还要求密勒太太替她保密，琼斯也代奥尔华绥答应下来了。柔 和娴静的苏菲亚本来很不愿意参加公开的应酬，经过这样安排之后，她才 稍稍放心，勉强依从父亲的意旨去赴宴。由于相信这个秘密不至于泄漏出 去，这一天她才应付得很不错；可是等乡绅喝到第二瓶酒的时候，他就再 也隐藏不住自己的喜悦心情了，他满满斟了一杯酒，开始祝新娘健康。座 上的宾客也立即一齐举杯向她祝酒，把可怜的苏菲亚窘得满脸通红，琼斯 也为她而局促不安。其实，这番泄密并没向赴宴的任何人透露什么新东
西，因为密勒太太早已小声告诉了她的女儿，她女儿告诉了自己的丈夫， 这位丈夫告诉了自己的妹妹，她又告诉了其余的人。
女客们一退席，苏菲亚立刻就随她们走开了。乡绅仍然抓住酒瓶不 放，宾客则陆续散了席，饮到后来只剩下小耐廷盖尔的叔父。这位老先生 同乡绅一样嗜酒如命。所以这两人就一直饮了一整晚，一往情深的琼斯把 娇艳的苏菲亚热烈地拥抱在怀里的那个幸福时刻过去了很久，两人仍在对 酌着。
读者，这部历史到此就这样结束了。令我们（也许出乎您的意料之 外）感到莫大欣悦的是，琼斯先生在收场时成为最幸福的人了，因为我不 得不老实承认，世上能与娶到苏菲亚为妻的这种幸福相比拟的，我还没发 现过。
至于其他在这部历史里扮演过相当的角色的人物，有些读者也许想大 致了解一下他们的结局。下面我们将尽量简单扼要地叙述一下，以满足这 些读者的好奇心。
奥尔华绥始终也不肯见布利非。不过，在琼斯的恳求和苏菲亚的支持 之下，他同意每年给他两百镑一一琼斯私下又添了一百。靠这笔款子他就 在距伦敦约二百哩的北部一郡定居下来，每年存起两百镑，以便在下届国 会选举时买下邻近一个选区的议员席位――这笔交易他已经和当地的律师 谈妥了。最近他又进了卫理公会，希望借此可以娶到一位信奉该教的富 孀，她的田产就在布利非所住的那一带。
斯奎尔在寄出前述那封信之后不久就去世了。至于屠瓦孔，他仍然在 他那个教区里当牧师。他曾多次想重获奥尔华绥的信任，并且想讨琼斯的 欢心，都没收到效果一一对这两位，他都是当面奉承，背后诟骂。近来， 奥尔华绥先生把亚伯拉罕•阿当姆斯妄先生聘到家来填补屠瓦孔的位置。苏 菲亚越来越喜欢这位先生，并且表示将来一定要他来教导她的子女。
费兹帕特利太太和她丈夫离了婚，保住了剩下的一点点财产。她以显 赫的气派住在京城里上流人的地区。她善于理财，所以虽然开销比她从财 产上得到的进益要大上三倍，却能不负债。她和那位爱尔兰贵族的夫人保 持着亲密的友谊，就用这种友谊来酬答她欠那位贵族的情分。
魏斯顿女士很快就同她的侄女苏菲亚和解了，并且来乡下跟她一道住 了两个月。当苏菲亚回到京城时，贝拉斯顿夫人正式拜望了她一次。见了 琼斯她就像完全不相识一样，对他彬彬有礼，向他道喜。
耐廷盖尔先生替他儿子在琼斯家附近买了一片田产。那位年轻绅士夫 妇以及密勒太太和她的小女儿住在一起，两家处得十分融洽。
再说说身份较为卑微的人吧。沃特尔太太又回到乡下去住了，奥尔华 绥给了她六十镑年金。她同撒波尔牧师结了婚。在苏菲亚的提议下，魏斯 顿也为那位牧师安排了一笔可观的俸禄。
黑乔治一听事情叫人家发现了就逃之夭夭，以后再没听到他的下落。 琼斯把那笔钱送给他家的人了，但不是平均分配，毛丽得的一份最多。
至于巴特里奇，琼斯赠给他五十镑年金，他又开办了一个私塾，这回 可比过去有起色多了。他和毛丽•西格里姆小姐之间的婚事正在酝酿，经苏 菲亚从中撮合，颇有成功的希望。
现在我们再折回来同琼斯先生和苏菲亚告别，他们婚后不到两天，就 在魏斯顿先生和奥尔华绥先生的陪同下，回乡间去了。魏斯顿把他的老宅 子和大部分田产都给了他女婿，他自己则搬到旁处一所较小的宅子里去， 那里更宜于行猎。当然，他时常到琼斯先生家来做客，而女婿和女儿也都 乐于尽一切力量来讨他的欢心。他们这种努力收到极好的效果，老先生说 他一辈子从来也不曾这么快乐过。琼斯替他安排了一间客厅和一个接待 室，他愿意同谁醉在那里就同谁醉在那里。他的女儿也和以往一样，什么 时候他高兴，她都准备弹琴给他听。因为琼斯曾明确地告诉苏菲亚，除了 使她本人幸福之外，他最称心的事就是娱悦老丈人的晚年。这样，苏菲亚 在她父亲面前尽的孝心，几乎同她对琼斯的温存同样使丈夫对她更加敬 爱。
苏菲亚已经为他生了两个漂亮孩子，一男一女。老先生十分疼爱他 们，他的许多时光都是在婴儿室里度过的。他说，刚过一岁半的小外孙女 咿呀学语的声音比英国猎狗最中听的吠声还要悦耳。
琼斯结婚之后，奥尔华绥对他也十分慷慨。只要有机会向琼斯和他的 妻子表示眷爱，他从不放过一一苏菲亚也像对生父那样敬爱他。不论琼斯 天性里有怎样不务正的倾向，由于这位善良人的熏陶，以及同既美貌又贤 淑的苏菲亚的结合，他还是改正过来了。他并且从对过去糊涂行为的反省 中，学会了在他这样生气蓬勃的人身上罕见的谨慎和稳重。
总之，正因为没有比这对恩爱夫妻更值得尊敬的人，我们也无法设想 比他们更加幸福的伉俪。他们始终保持着最纯洁、最真挚的爱情，通过相 互体贴，相互敬重，他们的爱情日益巩固和加深。他们对亲戚朋友也同样
热切关怀。他们待地位低于他们的人是这样谦逊，这样宽厚，这样仁爱， 所以没有一个街坊、佃户或仆人不是满怀感戴的心情来祝福琼斯先生迎娶 苏菲亚的那个日子的。
